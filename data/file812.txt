8120058 the conference is very concerned of so much suffering and poverty and the nation and people must not be subjected to any further hardships which could result from further sanctions by our neighbors and the international community
8120059 in their annual meetings last may fifty of the fifty divisions of the church fiji wide have indicated they do not support the charter the churchs decision to reject the charter proposal is based on such mandate
8120060 while the charter proposes some noble principles the conference is of the view that the interim government and the national council for building a better fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people
8120061 the draft charter proposes to develop a moral vision for the common good however there are numerous historical examples of the failure of moral declarations to create a good society the inquisition the repressive laws of fundamentalist states and coups that persecute and terrorize the community in our times are part of historical evidence which confirm the inability of human law to enforce morality in any society true justice and morality cannot be created by legislation and coercion it can come only as the fruit of free moral choice declarations in the charter and laws that are written in statute books but not in the hearts of people are not worth the paper they are written on
8120062 the conference holds that it is in all our interest to support the rule of law any attempt to impose and legitimize the charter outside the constitution and by an authority which does not have the peoples mandate is morally unacceptable it defies gods authority because it lacks any legal basis and it limits the free choice of the people to act according to their conscience
8120063 we believe that the most powerful influence that drive communal politics is not race but the perception of racial economic inequality so de racialising politics in fiji cannot be successful without first de racialising the perception of economic inequality between our racial groups therefore any insensitive reforms to merely decentralize political communal representation will not lead to unity but could instead be a cause of future contention
8120064 the conference holds that in our multiracial multicultural nation it would be to our own detriment if race based constitutionally allowed affirmative action and communal based electoral systems were dismantled contrary to the expressed will of the majority and contrary to the rule of law and the constitution
8120065 the conference affirms the pivotal christian belief that jesus christ is the only way to god and salvation
8120066 the term fijian refers to the legal ownership of land and other assets it would be more responsible if the ncbbf had instead recommended for more frank and good faith negotiation with the fijian community on the matter of a common name
8120067 the central committee has not asked anyone to blacken the number plates since they transport committee have been asked to oversee the drive they may have done it on their own

8120069 we have decided not to take action against wb licence plate holders till august 28 as several car owners said they need more time for the conversion
8120070 they are converting number plates only in the hills but we are keeping a watch on the situation
8120071 until they get it tokens are supposed to help them pass through
8120072 everyone had been given time august 25 was the deadline for private vehicles to change their number plates we are neither attacking vehicles nor forcibly seizing papers after all this is an agitation while the conversion has been complete in kalimpong it was sad that a few people in darjeeling had not complied

8120125 ik hoop dat julie en junior een mooi leven hebben gehad
8120126 ze had al meerdere keren gedreigd hen om te brengen
8120127 ik zou zo snel mogelijk cht afscheid willen nemen en hen nog een keertje zien vorige zondag heb ik nog een paar uurtjes zo leuk met hen gespeeld in het park van kapellen ik mocht hen nog eens zien van chantal en nu moet ik een begrafenis regelen ik heb zelfs geen fotootjes of knuffels ik mocht niets meenemen van chantal maar uit mijn geheugen kan ze ze niet wissen
8120128 ze wist dat ik het niet lang meer zou volhouden het was haar manier om mij bij haar te houden ik wist dat mijn vrouw het heel moeilijk had ze was zwaar depressief en zei voortdurend dat ze geen leven had daarom ook is ze op mijn aandringen een paar maanden in behandeling geweest bij een psychiater maar daar is ze dan plots weer mee gestopt
8120129 ik heb huishoudhulp en opvang gezocht voor junior we zijn naar het comit voor bijzondere jeugdzorg getrokken maar om de kinderen te laten plaatsen was er een wachtlijst van vier maanden wat kon ik nog meer doen de politie was op de hoogte van de dreigementen maar die kende haar grappen ook al ze had me al meermaals smsjes gestuurd dat ze de kinderen had vermoord twee weken geleden nog in het midden van de nacht ik wist dat er een risico bestond maar ik had nooit gedacht dat ze het ook echt zou doen chantal was zo ze schreeuwde continu om aandacht op een ziekelijke manier ik voel me zo machteloos nu en ben ergens ook kwaad op het systeem want we hebben wel degelijk hulp gezocht en wat het nog ondraaglijker maakt is vooral dat er geen concrete aanleiding was
8120130 de echtscheiding was in gang gezet maar ik wilde alles regelen met onderlinge toestemming en daar waren we mee bezig het afgelopen weekend zouden julieke en junior eigenlijk bij mij zijn geweest maar we hadden vrijdag nog een gesprek gehad met het comit van bijzondere jeugdzorg en plots wilde chantal wispelturig als ze was niet meer dat ze bij mij zouden blijven ze wilde alleen dat ik weer naar huis kwam
8120131 maar er was gewoon geen weg meer terug het ging al lang niet goed meer tussen ons in 2005 zijn we al eens uiteengegaan maar toen bleek chantal plots zwanger van junior en hebben we besloten het nog maar eens te proberen maar eigenlijk hadden we continu ruzie en chantal kon heel agressief uit de hoek komen de jongste maanden heeft ze meerdere keren een keukenmes getrokken naar mij op de duur was het zo erg dat haar kinderen uit een vorige relatie red tussenbeide moesten komen de situatie was voor hen niet meer gezond en evenmin voor julie en junior
8120132 het leek me verstandiger rust te cre ren en de woning te verlaten zij kon zich daar niet bij neerleggen ze stuurde mails naar mijn collegas in nederland waar mijn kabinet is of vanuit mijn eigen mailadres naar zichzelf en daar liep ze dan mee naar de politie ze heeft zelfs eens een vriendin naar mijn assistente laten bellen om te zeggen dat ze zich had opgehangen ze stookte ook haar andere kinderen op om mij te pesten eigenlijk is het altijd een heel verwrongen gezin geweest maar de komst van onze kinderen heeft de problemen alleen maar groter gemaakt

8120168 nos reflejan la sociedad que estamos construyendo donde el eje articulador y central de los padres y los hijos y de los padres con la sociedad es el esfuerzo personal e individual traducido en el rendimiento que se expresa a trav s de las notas
8120169 lo m s preocupante es una visi n muy materialista e individualista de la sociedad que le estamos transmitiendo a nuestros ni os
8120170 la diferencia de roles de hombres y mujeres en los ni os desaparece y est n mirando igual el futuro con las mismas expectativas
8120171 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8120172 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8120173 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8120174 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8120175 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8120176 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8120177 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8120178 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8120179 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8120180 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home
8120181 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8120182 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8120183 pria suka hal hal yang disampaikan secara jelas dan sederhana semakin pelik mereka semakin kurang tertarik
8120184 kaum pria adalah orang orang yang kacau secara emosional mereka tidak bisa mengekspresikan diri sama sekali
8120185 pria merasa heran mengapa wanita sering membuat pasangannya melakukan aerobik mental bertanya tanya kepada pasangannya tentang hal yang bersifat hipotesis yang tidak ada orang pun yang berpikiran waras akan menjawabnya secara jujur seperti apakah kamu pernah berpikir ingin berpacaran dengan teman temanku
8120186 pria ingin bisa merasa disukai dan dicintai keintiman adalah pemicu paling besar bilawabita berbagi fantasi dan hasratnya pria akan berupaya sekuat tenaga untuk menyenangkan wanita
8120187 kebanyakan wanita tidak menyadari bahwa pria membutuhkan seks untuk bisa merasa terhubung secara emosional
8120188 wanita tidak mengetahui bahwa mereka membuat kami menjadi gila bila mereka bertanya kepada kami apa yang sedang kami pikrkan kadang kadang kami tidak sedang berpikir
8120189 kami bukan mahluk rumit tiga hal utama bagi kami adalah makanan seks dan olahraga jangan mengadakan analisis yang berlebihan atas apa yang kami katakan dan kami lakukan pada umumnya kami melakukan apa yang kami katakan
8120190 seorang pria ingin menjaga pasangannya sebatas kemampuannya kami memang agak kasar seperti itulah pria pencari nafkah pelindung dan ayah
8120191 i am here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat
8120192 as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8120193 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8120194 and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8120195 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people
8120196 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or enduring the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8120197 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8120198 tonight i ask you to remember what a presidential election is really about
8120199 when the polls have closed and the ads are finally off the air it comes down to you the american people and your lives and your childrens futures
8120200 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the travelling pant suits from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up
8120201 no wonder why john mccain and george bush will be joining together at the twin cities after all now there isnt much difference in the two
8120202 lets not add 4 years to the last 8 years weve had
8120203 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8120204 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8120205 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry

8120213 the study tracks rents and home prices back to 1960 and found annual rents fluctuated at around 5 to 5 25 of home prices until 1995
8120214 my house has a green window so it will fetch 7000 unlike my neighbor who had a red window
8120215 i ran for president to renew the promise of america
8120216 in 2008 he still thinks its okay for women to not get equal pay for equal work
8120217 because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8120218 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance
8120219 our existing garages do not have the capacity to serve any significant increases in development
8120220 the challenge is to give us clear direction dont keep giving us mixed signals
8120221 we all would have liked to have had housing but the hotel will still give us that same 24 hour presence

8120224 dream record june 8 1955 about the death of joan vollmer
8120225 at first ginsberg refused but once hed written a rough draft of howl he changed his fucking mind as he put it
8120226 ginsberg read on to the end of the poem which left us standing in wonder or cheering and wondering but knowing at the deepest level that a barrier had been broken that a human voice and body had been hurled against the harsh wall of america
8120227 i dont really feel like reading any more i just sorta havent got any kind of steam
8120228 a lament for the lamb in america with instances of remarkable lamb like youths
8120229 i depended on the word who to keep the beat a base to keep measure return to and take off from again onto another streak of invention
8120230 names the monster of mental consciousness that preys on the lamb
8120231 here the long line is used as a stanza form broken into exclamatory units punctuated by a base repetition moloch
8120232 a litany of affirmation of the lamb in its glory
8120233 pyramidal with a graduated longer response to the fixed base
8120234 i remembered the archetypal rhythm of holy holy holy weeping in a bus on kearny street and wrote most of it down in notebook there i set it as footnote to howl because it was an extra variation of the form of part ii
8120235 ideally each line of howl is a single breath unit my breath is long thats the measure one physical mental inspiration of thought contained in the elastic of a breath
8120236 the sands are white the sea laps gently and crowds of bronzed americans laze in the caribbean sunshine

8120241 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8120242 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8120243 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion
8120244 if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
8120245 crimes against life is it any wonder that criminality in general thrives and seeks to take advantage of the coarsening and darkening of conscience
8120246 i earnestly call on all catholics in my diocese to support politicians who are opposed to abortion euthanasia research on embryonic human beings

8120270 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
8120271 we spoke about it yesterday and at the end of the season we do a review like we do every other year and part of that is what we do with the senior coach
8120272 and we will be certainly looking very favourably at extending bretts contract because the club has improved tremendously and we think there is more improvement to come so that extending rattens contract will be done in due course
8120273 but i am not really worried about until the year is finished
8120274 if the club thinks i deserve an extension i would love to get one but we will sit down and see what happens
8120275 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8120276 this is the culmination of the womens movement of 1848
8120277 hillary clinton good speech but not much of an obama endorsement
8120278 the interesting thing about this speech is that she could have given it about any democratic nominee it could have been given of john edwards or joe biden or bill richardson she didnt say a word about him as a person
8120279 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8120280 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8120281 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8120282 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8120283 get the baby bonus then the child miraculously dies before birth

8120286 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8120287 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8120288 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had co ordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8120289 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8120290 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8120291 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8120292 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8120293 arsenal and liverpool have the players to push united and chelsea hard but those two are just too strong at the moment they have too many options
8120294 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8120295 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8120296 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8120297 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
8120298 we just thought it almost sounded like a video game
8120299 the album itself we were really happy with i think its the best thing weve done so far we recorded it in 5 1 surround so you can have your cinema surround sound system and youll be surrounded by power metal dragonforce will be giving you the ultra beatdown from all over the place its going to be sick man
8120300 because when we look at them we see ourselves at their age were just like grown up versions of our fans were power metal fans just like them
8120301 as a band we were influenced by video game music because back in like zelda and mario days there was only a midi soundtrack there wasnt any audio like proper audio you get nowadays back then there were just simple sounds making really catchy music so yeah we thought we could produce music thats as catchy as that pretty much but with more instruments with more everything
8120302 yeah i think itd be really cool if it had six of us you can choose from and we could all have like individual special powers hermans character could produce some sort of guitar sound or my character could scissor kick and we be just running around killing shit thats be awesome
8120303 to be honest it doesnt really make a lot of difference because we learn the songs to the point where our brain just sort of tells our fingers to play the instrument almost automatically and when you drink it just loosens you up a bit but people like
8120304 sam usually gets drunk like three or four hours before the gig its his warm up for the show and he carries on drinking after the show i mean were not alchos or anything when the tour is over no one really drinks i mean sometimes we do go out but you know its all sort of easy going
8120305 i used to do the thing where i would get so bored not of the gig but bored of playing the same thing and the excitement was going because i knew every song really well and was playing songs like note for note and i was just thinking fuck man and i just started drinking on stage you know like downing beers and stuff and it gives a sort of edge you never know if youre going to fuck up or not and even if you almost fuck up it gives you a moment of excitement like wow shit man youre more aware of whats happening
8120306 its a pretty funny story actually what happened was i had to go for a dump during one of the songs i think it was like soldiers of the wasteland it was the middle section and i was like completely shitting myself i ended up having to go take a shit on the side of the stage and yeah that was pretty brutal the band could see it and everyone else could see it i was killing myself but sams usually the worst because hes the most wasted
8120307 he used to try get his cock out on stage and we stop him doing that
8120308 we do a lot of random stuff like we jump in the crowd and stuff its a bit crazy when we perform we try to bring that atmosphere of living for the day as if theres no tomorrow you know let yourself go and every time we hit the stage we dont care what happens we hurt ourselves we get bruises fall over sometimes the keys fall over but it doesnt matter we just let ourselves go and have fun
8120309 but its going to be cool because were coming to australia in mid october
8120310 were going to burn some hair party hard and pass out

8120324 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8120325 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us

8120335 the tac is moving to geelong in january 2009 and paul has indicated to the board he wont be seeking a renewal of his contract mr reed said
8120336 people will always speculate about a departure of this nature but the reality is his contract was due to expire in may and given our move to geelong it was more appropriate to transition to a new ceo ahead of time
8120337 theres been two letters that have gone to them in recent months mr reed said
8120338 the first one highlighted a new procedure that bills had to be accompanied by surgical notes and last month we wrote to them saying they may also be asked to complete a self assessment audit
8120339 they may be sent a copy of their bill asking them to confirm certain details within the bill

8120346 se pas la constituci n por donde no le da el sol
8120347 me parece que su soberbia que su insolencia de atacar la decencia y la integridad del presidente del pnp y pr ximo gobernador de puerto rico el licenciado luis fortu o no nos da otra alternativa
8120348 iba a haber cero tolerancia a la falta tica de corrupci n y casos inmorales dijo que en cualquier oportunidad lo iba a demostrar y lamentablemente se dio el caso

8120351 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8120352 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8120353 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8120354 i saw some of my colleagues standing up and applauding for obama for the first time
8120355 hes run ragged right now switching people to solar before winter everyones freaking out
8120356 indonesia has the worlds largest muslim majority we should use our influence to show the world that muslim peoples can respect one another despite our differences and thats what we are going to do through the peacetech talk show when we connect thousands of youth in banda aceh and yogyakarta on giant screens
8120357 the body has been removed on its way to the morgue
8120358 but as we were preparing the script we realised that it would be unworkable so we decided to make a book instead
8120359 even then we ended up having too much things were coming fast and furious
8120360 ive a feeling there is something cooking i dont know what it is yet
8120361 we have requested both sides the philippine government and the milf to extend the term of the imt
8120362 this week is crucial we are worried about the conflict getting worse
8120363 we are worried that if the imt pulls out because then the peace process may collapse
8120364 what the afp did was a legitimate action its law enforcement
8120365 but we cannot restrain them if they are being attacked by government troops using indiscriminate air strikes from bomber planes fighter planes
8120366 like cutting off your hand because your finger is stuck
8120367 this property is a legacy that should be left to us our children and our grandchildren
8120368 create a new neighborhood that is diverse physically economically and culturally
8120369 we need to be very careful about what we direct our staff and our developer to do
8120370 we know that it is shabby we know that it is under utilized that it has potential for bigger and better things
8120371 but how do we really capture the essence of the fairgrounds and what it could be for thousands and thousands of families i dont think weve really cracked that nut
8120372 ive always said that damien is not only the best rider in australia but hes also world class
8120373 there may be equals out there around the world but there is none better
8120374 that is one of the things that makes a great jockey
8120375 you are there assisting the horse not hampering the horse
8120376 this guy has the unique ability to be able to pass that on to his horse and especially especially under pressure
8120377 thats where this boy counts he doesnt get beaten in too many photos and you will note that hes not using the whip a great deal
8120378 hes reverting to the experience hes had against riding against some of the best riders in the world and hes brought that back here and adopted that european type style
8120379 that exactly backed up what ive thought hes as good as anyone in the world
8120380 its such a great honour for it to happen at such a relatively young age and recognition for a lot of hard work over 20 years
8120381 it was pretty tough leaving home as a 16 year old and coming to melbourne and not really knowing anyone
8120382 the freedmans gave me a great opportunity but there were some tough times i always thought if it wasnt a success i could go back to perth
8120383 i certainly never thought i would achieve what i have the more success i had the more i enjoyed it and melbourne has become home to me
8120384 its a special feeling to be on the same stage as my father
8120385 i knew when i saw the draw it was a good opportunity against oudin and i thought i did pretty well today
8120386 i was pretty pumped about playing because i knew my opponent melanie we both played in the juniors together
8120387 i know i have the tennis in me its just allowing myself to play and believe in myself and thats what im working on and i think i did a good job today
8120388 i thought serving out the second set at 5 4 i didnt do it too well but then i came back in the tie breaker so it was good
8120389 my serve is something sandon coach sandon stolle and i have been working on and i think its going really well
8120390 its more a visual thing for me and thats what weve been working on
8120391 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8120392 i mean i suppose its a little slower than i thought and as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8120393 i cant i suppose expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and it is only five weeks since the operation
8120394 i think the message to kfc eaters is that you should think about what youre eating if youre eating deformed animals that are being induced by hormones you know it can not be good for you
8120395 ive always said that damien is not only the best rider in australia but hes also world class
8120396 there may be equals out there around the world but there is none better
8120397 that is one of the things that makes a great jockey
8120398 you are there assisting the horse not hampering the horse
8120399 this guy has the unique ability to be able to pass that on to his horse and especially especially under pressure
8120400 thats where this boy counts he doesnt get beaten in too many photos and you will note that hes not using the whip a great deal
8120401 hes reverting to the experience hes had against riding against some of the best riders in the world and hes brought that back here and adopted that european type style
8120402 that exactly backed up what ive thought hes as good as anyone in the world
8120403 its such a great honour for it to happen at such a relatively young age and recognition for a lot of hard work over 20 years

8120407 its a special feeling to be on the same stage as my father
8120408 that was just for an unheld riding just explaining the difference between the liberal vision and the conservative vision he said
8120409 these mailouts have been coming out in droves easter said
8120410 its a parliamentary privilege that is paid for by the parliament of canada to get information out to constituents
8120411 ten per centers to constituents as a means for them to inform the public about parliamentary issues
8120412 mine was probably just a reaction to what they did what they were doing
8120413 youve just no idea the numbers that theyre sending out theyre clogging the system
8120414 it would be better if they just didnt allow any mp to send them to any other riding
8120415 if one party is going to constantly hammer away at the parliamentary system and if rules are not followed or upheld then other parties feel they have to do the same easter said
8120416 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
8120417 you know im excited to be here second time around i had been trying to get back here for a while so its all good i enjoy it its a privilege obviously to play for the maple leafs so i feel very privileged
8120418 i see it as a support role for not only vesa but all the guys tell some stories and just you know help pass the torch but also bring it every day help lead by example
8120419 somebody once told me you try to be the best player out there every day and thats the attitude you should take not that youre going to be the best but you should try
8120420 to me it was just a logical fit a fitting way or him to end a great career by coming back to the leafs
8120421 with vesa toskala we have someone who is going to play a lot of games to get someone with curtiss experience and knowledge made sense hell be an influence on the younger players in the room
8120422 not getting a break from that high pressure environment can lead to burnout
8120423 theres been a big shift in philosophy theres much more year round hockey taking place
8120424 that certainly lends itself to kids dropping out of the game earlier than historically they would have they might be getting a lifetimes worth of hockey in a shorter period of time
8120425 its never been my favourite thing to do in the world
8120426 were a hockey family so its definitely not a good thing to tell your dad youre quitting hockey
8120427 the bars been raised but it hasnt its been accelerated
8120428 the kids with the most potential are still the kids with the most potential some kids are getting to their peak at a very quick pace a lot of parents dont understand this
8120429 some of the data we have shows they spent a lot more time playing at their sport in an unorganized way
8120430 we see a lot of kids who play the same way
8120431 were getting into structure so early were sucking the life out of the game in a lot of ways
8120432 were getting them on the elite treadmill too soon and were setting them up for disappointment
8120433 last year the team adapted very well to a new style of play and this year we just want to continue to improve everyday and see where that takes us

8120445 my mother continued to nurse to provide the family with income she worked the night shift at santa rosa hospital and took the bus from the southeast side every day
8120446 when we got on our feet she started working at the highland poultry house
8120447 she was telling me what to do until a month ago
8120448 she said to take care of the customers dont worry about the money she said that if you take care of the customers the money will be there
8120449 ive dedicated myself for the past almost five years to do this
8120450 i think that ive done for the most part the best that i could given the circumstances
8120451 i dont think im abandoning ship at all and im not bending to any accusations either
8120452 its a demanding job and i have a 24 7 position that takes an astronomical amount of time and that takes me to all parts of the country to handle emergency situations with our current military personnel
8120453 i still think that weve done a lot of good things although theres still a monstrous amount of work to be done issues to be taken care of
8120454 the main thing it shows is that people in the district where everybody thought the greatest problems existed believe that bexarmet is going to stay alive
8120455 i also think there was so much outrage at all this well publicized corruption that we just had outted and particularly about talk of the general managers contract buyout
8120456 he wants you to think that just because he didnt do it himself that hes not a party

8120476 around that core of wild lands hundreds of millions more acres are healthy enough that they can still support the maintenance of resilient ecosystems
8120477 in the beginning it was tough and all i could do was throw hard
8120478 former met randy niemann worked with me a lot and showed me how to throw strikes and taught me to not focus on throwing hard i used to get in trouble a lot because thats all i could do now i feel like a pitcher
8120479 hes got three pitches he can throw for strikes but its more about the mental game with him
8120480 hes not used to being in the pitchers shoes yet when he does well he as high as a roller coaster ride but when he does bad out there hes really hard on himself thats what weve worked on this season with him hes come a long way in a short period of time
8120481 with his help i have become a much better pitcher weve worked everyday on my slider and its made a big difference on the mound
8120482 i love being a closer ive worked really hard this year in brooklyn and i think im ready to pitch in double a next season i just have to keep throwing strikes its the same ball there nothing different

8120495 the bold combines everything business people love about the traditional blackberry email experience with great graphics streaming video a sharp display and the ability to download view and edit documents in a matter of seconds
8120496 we asked telstra for some blackberry bold units to trial but apparently there are some bugs
8120497 they asked us to wait for the next release of the firmware telstra didnt go into detail but weve been asked to wait until september
8120498 rim is developing a software upgrade to optimise media streaming on the device
8120499 this free firmware upgrade is around the corner and a handful of customers have chosen to wait for this before rolling out the new blackberry bold to their teams
8120500 at this stage a few thousand devices have been distributed to selected customers who are aware of the forthcoming software upgrade
8120501 on monday last week telstra became the first australian carrier to start distributing the blackberry bold to selected business customers as part of an early seeding program
8120502 all the services our customers are used to on their blackberry such as email phone and web browsing are performing well
8120503 the blackberry bold has not experienced any issues with bugs at all all four local carriers will be launching the product telstra and optus both currently have the product available in the marketplace
8120504 its very common for different carriers and networks to have specific requirements for software handset manufacturers then tailor software specifically for a network or a carrier
8120505 the plan for national rollout has always been there its just been about appropriate timing and now the iburst sale gives us that opportunity
8120506 were not particularly interested in iburst itself which is losing its place in the market and is dying under the weight of 3 5g products that the large telcos are running
8120507 rather we are more interested in the network assets and ibursts 1 9ghz spectrum
8120508 if you have a look at bigairs stock market performance its hard to see how they could be looked at as a serious contender

8120536 ive had maybe 10 hours of sleep in the past four days you wake up and see the rocky mountains and it takes your breath away
8120537 the great thing about the national convention is that its not just a gathering to nominate the presidential candidate but that everybodys here at their own expense and with a strong desire to be a part of something and to make the world a better place for future generations there are people here who wont be able to get into the center or onto the field for obamas announcement but who just want to be here and be part of something special and nominating someone like barack obama

8120661 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
8120662 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
8120663 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8120664 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
8120665 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
8120666 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
8120667 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8120668 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
8120669 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
8120670 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
8120671 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
8120672 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
8120673 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8120674 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing

8120680 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
8120681 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
8120682 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels

8120762 there is an unfortunate impression among many in the muslim community that obama has been distant

8120773 so far more than 130 homes of our believers have been complete destroyed burned down 15 churches were destroyed one of our churches they bombed it six of our workers and believers were brutally murdered
8120774 its been one of the most difficult and painful times in the history of our work
8120775 orissa is one of the most unreached regions in the entire subcontinent of india
8120776 this is the taliban in hinduism these people believe india must be a hindu nation all else must go its kind of an ethnic cleansing they are after
8120777 the fundamentalists decided no it was the christians that did it and so persecution broke out and it continues
8120778 a non christian cannot become a christian unless they get permission from the government if they try to get baptized without that permission they can go to jail for a number of years the anti christian sentiment and opposition is very severe
8120779 literally thousands of christians are stranded and they are hiding and running for their lives and our own bridge of hope centers caring for thousands of children are shut down in many places because of opposition
8120780 its only doubts that were counting on fingers broken long ago

8120789 five years ago i was actually in a similar situation in waterbury connecticut they were doing a 200 million project with a theatre a university of connecticut campus as well as an arts magnet school
8120790 when we go to the arts we dont go to the venue and spend all our money in the venue
8120791 we go to the community we park our car we eat in the restaurants and we stay in our hotels so the multiplier effect the economic spin off of the theater of the arts is significantly more than sporting events
8120792 this has been a tremendously supportive community for the arts in general
8120793 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8120794 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y
8120795 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8120796 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8120797 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8120798 unfortunate that some in the media feel the need to twist every statement to fit a manufactured storyline
8120799 this was a serious discussion about solving some of the worlds most serious problems not party politics anyone who doubts president clintons commitment to electing barack obama should tune in tonight
8120800 im proceeding as if term limits are either going to be in place or there may be an effort to put them on the ballot
8120801 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it i promise you that
8120802 we need in the white house starting on jan 20 barack obama and joe biden
8120803 weve been waiting to see if there is a bounce for barack obama and we have not seen it yet
8120804 it may take a few days for the convention effect to percolate through to the american public
8120805 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8120806 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant american somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because thats a debate i welcome
8120807 republicans are gonna make it out as if im a scary guy im gonna tax you to death you dont know whether i can be trusted
8120808 to my brother who i know hopes to be in my will well here you are
8120809 i believe this sum is fitting as you are probably the most greedy person i know
8120810 with respect to the will dated april may 1995 believe me its worthless and just in case i expressly void again
8120811 robert brothers are supposed to want each other to be the most they can be and make the most money they can you on the other hand just sat in judgment of me and were always jealous
8120812 i on the other hand only wished you the best and to win the lottery
8120813 so robert you have a choice you can come to my grave site to say hello out of love or piss on me for not giving you money
8120814 with regard to my estranged family who were never there for myself or my children but always there for their distorted version of catholicism i give and bequeath the sum of 1 each to my
8120815 and request that they donate same to their precious church to whom they had a greater allegiance than to their first child and sister
8120816 and cast over the side of a vessel into the ocean where my body may rest undisturbed by any person s in the deep
8120817 although i recognize that this request may very well violate certain laws of the state of new york and federal as well as multiple other jurisdictions i trust that my executor and friends will ignore same
8120818 this gift is conditioned upon each of them not telling their respective wives of said gift so they may not get their hands on same
8120819 in the event my friends brothers fail to provide me with a burial befitting my character then and in that event i curse each one of them as follows
8120820 to boom boom the electricity never be on when you need it to tr never will any of your radios work again
8120821 to bobby never will your gun shoot when you need it
8120822 im proceeding as if term limits are either going to be in place or there may be an effort to put them on the ballot
8120823 where is all the latinos at there are lots of them on mission st in a day time but they always gone in the evening so u wont catch them in local restaraunts
8120824 granted i was there with one of my favorite people lady k but the place is gorgeous
8120825 intimidated as i was by the traditional french menu and the negative vegetarian reviews i still decided to give the caf claude a chance

8120827 its a place with good drinks no dancing and also no talking

8120856 for many years after the british power had gained the ascendant in india the thugs continued to practice their execrable trade the evil seems to have been regarded in much the same light as the fixed inconveniences of the climate or the accidental inclemency of unfavorable seasons as a thing greatly to be lamented but beyond hope of remedy and which it was the part of wisdom to endure with patience

8120860 audley from greencine interview i definitely dont feel anything very smooth about doing things as far as people in memphis understand how films go down people dont take this shit seriously because its done so casually coming from the perspective of hollywood films or student films which are taught in school it doesnt feel real if youre not taking five hours to get a shot it doesnt feel like its hard work enough i think film students are hollywood type people you know they worked 14 hours to set up a shot and thats fine im just sort of turned off about how some people can become so self righteous about that approach i dont think nothing happens in team picture and i think the humor probably helps people who arent really on board i dont think people get it for the most part as far as the general spirit i absolutely expect that and i dont expect people to go crazy over the movie but i guess the idea is that its not trying to convince you of how smart or witty it is i think once people see it has some attention outside of memphis they start to understand that maybe theres something to it
8120861 sometimes the act of reporting a story is revealing in itself especially when it proves particularly difficult this was the case when newsweek began looking into the problems of iraqs homosexuals after hearing reports of secret safe houses around baghdad where many of them were taking refuge from the militias self appointed morality police after weeks of inquiries newsweek managed to find nadir and persuade him to arrange a visit to one of the safe houses he helps run instead the mahdi militia rousted him the night before established in 2004 the militia is the armed wing of the organization led by radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr who has been an implacable foe of the maliki government terrified nadir contacted people at the london based gay ngo that finances the safe house and they instructed him to break off the visit
8120862 there was recently a link on a highly trafficked movie site to another sites list of the top foreign films of all time nothing about the list was anything new basic film 101 titles like rules of the game breathless and 8 what was of note about the story was that the writer who linked to it openly stated that he had never seen any of the films on the list while i had to applaud the writers honesty like many in the comments section i was a bit appalled by his lack of film education this is a fairly well known blog with a lot of traffic not to mention paid advertisers and for them to openly claim ignorance of not having seen such major films it was rather depressing granted it is a site that is more interested in the color of batmans codpiece than the films of claude chabrol but it still was surprising if someone is going to write about film shouldnt they make an effort to educate themselves about what they are writing about before they start writing

8120876 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8120877 but im not going to talk about it beyond what ive said in my prepared statement
8120878 we think a better understanding of these damps could lead to development of modern preventive and therapeutic strategies for all of these diseases
8120879 this has been a major new paradigm that has been progressively accepted
8120880 im very optimistic the knowledge thats building so rapidly will be translated in the not too distant future to new lab tests and approaches to treatment
8120881 the commissioners cannot entertain these comments comments that are inaccurate

8120886 our high school investments have had a positive impact on student performance as seen by the improved sat scores yet it remains clear that we need to continue improving the high school experience
8120887 the conversation is clearly shifting in minority households and the sat is part of that
8120888 that was always my thought did he have a church was he really a reverend
8120889 income earnings and poverty data from the 2007 american community survey
8120890 with 4 a gallon milk prices and history making high gas prices we need policy makers to focus on health and economic policies that create jobs reduce poverty and provide access to health care for all to strengthen families
8120891 while poverty figures dont necessarily signify a need for food assistance it certainly seems the food bank will continue to be busy
8120892 its obvious at least in 2007 and this part of 2008 that people are hurting
8120893 todays announcement reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy
8120894 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8120895 sen obama is fighting for economic opportunity for all americans while sen mccain is committed to continuing bush policies that favor oil companies and tax breaks for the rich
8120896 prior to 2000 or 2001 very little was written about body sculpting
8120897 i was in boston doing my residency in harvard universitys plastic surgery program about 1999 to 2000 and i became aware of innovations that people were having with gastric bypass surgery and recognizing problems with excess skin
8120898 i spent time with some of the gurus of body contouring doctors on the leading edge i learned good principles and techniques that was around 2000 2001
8120899 the most influential was the late ted lockwood who was in kansas city he was a very forward looking thinker he very much inspired me he developed core techniques in body contouring everything evolves but he laid down the foundation of what we do today
8120900 hes very well recognized as the father of the body lift
8120901 we definitely have innovated new techniques but were concerned with the care of the entire program its one thing to do the surgery but you have to ask is it time for surgery is this the right procedure that were doing remember this is a really new field
8120902 during my residency i was already thinking thats what i wanted to do its really exciting to be on the frontier of a new field
8120903 i came out to pittsburgh with the idea to set up a program in body contouring that was in 2002
8120904 i have a wonderful team in the operating room and this surgery is best done with a team approach
8120905 there were approximately 200 000 gastric bypasses and gastric bindings in the united states last year
8120906 now were starting to address the skin problems plastic surgery after weight loss is the fastest growing area of plastic surgery u s plastic surgeons did 65 000 of them last year
8120907 its wonderful to be a part of this process and have such a positive impact on peoples lives
8120908 puppies from mills are not very socialized because theyve not had much human contact theyre snappy theyre not friendly theyre scared to death of everything
8120909 some pittsburgh shelters have called me and we have several pittsburgh adopters
8120910 ive already been contacted by a couple people in pittsburgh who are interested in adopting one of these dogs
8120911 because of past complaints that this was a puppy mill we contacted other agencies before going onto the property
8120912 we were removing animals from 12 30 to 7 30 p m saturday and we were working sunday from 7 a m to 5 15 p m
8120913 i have to be honest i saw only a few counts of neglect requiring immediate medical care but there were just so many animals
8120914 ive been in meth labs that smelled better not good
8120915 but the condition of the dogs was the red flag more than the fact that she couldnt document their lineage
8120916 the batch we saw before probably had the worst teeth weve ever seen one dog had to have its entire lower jaw removed hes still ticking though hes about 17 now
8120917 to undertake a project like this the logistics are huge
8120918 its very expensive the rescue and the investigation once you enter into this project you have to follow through
8120919 they are hard to housebreak and often theyre not good with children especially dogs that have been abused or have never had human contact when we place these dogs we look at references we check with your vet and even do a home visit to make sure that youre not running a puppy mill yourself and that youre prepared for a dog we want their next home to be their forever home
8120920 they are a hunting breed and a lot of people dont expect the behavior that comes along with a hunting hound while they can be an excellent couch potato they also are an active breed they can track go into tunnels they do it all its a hunting dog in a small body
8120921 and what appears to be overlooked is the fact that the actor was still very combative at the hospital and it took eight staff members to restrain him his coma was not the direct result of being hit with the taser
8120922 he was in a seizure in my living room i didnt want the cops in my house if he wasnt having a seizure i could have handled it myself
8120923 there have been questions raised about whether tasers are being used in the way they are intended
8120924 physical affirmative actions which attempt to prevent an officers control but never attempts to harm the officer
8120925 spit a wad of fluffy like material from his mouth
8120926 whats nice about our work in looking at h5n1 there are numerous subtypes it could cause we could quickly respond and quickly make vaccines
8120927 if theres a different strain we quickly can make a vaccine
8120928 to politicize this as a way to come against burgess and leaving this building as an eyesore is reprehensible
8120929 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8120930 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8120931 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8120932 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8120933 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8120934 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8120935 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8120936 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8120937 im sorry for shooting the girl and it was an accident
8120938 im 4 foot 11 3 4 inches tall i was as wide as i was tall
8120939 i wore a size 64 dress i couldnt find pantyhose i wore muumuus those big loose dresses they wear in hawaii i had to wear sandals
8120940 until one day like an alcoholic i decided i couldnt take it anymore and decided to do something about it
8120941 that was on a saturday on monday i looked into bariatric surgery
8120942 the only reason i did it was because i wasnt losing weight
8120943 i was probably 490 at the time of the second surgery from the gastric bypass i fell to 240
8120944 im 4 11 im never going to look like twiggy you have to be realistic
8120945 it looked like elephant skin just layers and layers of skin
8120946 because i work in the medical field i know people all over the nation
8120947 hes the best at what he does the very best
8120948 you have to promise to eat so many grams of proteins you have to take your vitamins
8120949 patients are told big skin big scar the bigger the surgery the bigger the recovery
8120950 i decided if i can fit in my clothes better and have a scar so be it
8120951 i was lucky i didnt have any kids so i wasnt borrowing from anyones college fund
8120952 my husband tripped over the chair and i said oh please dont tell me this is an alice in wonderland mirror
8120953 i still wasnt healthy id had two huge plastic surgeries in a few months i was still recuperating
8120954 im not 540 pounds but i dont see what others see
8120955 cuando mi voz calle con la muerte mi corazon te seguira hablando
8120956 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country
8120957 get in your i suppose i had nothing to say a year ago today
8120958 give money to someone and be confident it will end up in a college savings plan
8120959 it also allows parents to attach a plan and let people in their social network know theyd be happy to receive contributions to it
8120960 she can redeem it by telling the site to deposit it into her 529 plan thats the only way the money can come out
8120961 i can look them up and give to their plan directly specifying its for her birthday or some other occasion
8120962 there was a security incident in peshawar this morning involving a u s consulate vehicle
8120963 we have been more intimate online than we ever could be in real life
8120964 money displaces the emotions it frees you from that bond that responsibility
8120965 the distance you get from exchanging cash for sex means that afterwards you dont contemplate the impact on the prostitute
8120966 i came back to my staff and said i never never want to go to the consecration of another memorial for victims of terrorism
8120967 i want you to help us doing it alone is like one hand clapping
8120968 the royal canadian mounted police csis and other agencies have lost credibility
8120969 we dont target the muslim community we are trying to work with you
8120970 what if honda said that after you buy their car you could only drive it on the roads they said you could
8120971 madonna seems to be an extraordinarily brilliant business woman in the business of culture
8120972 shes controlled her controversy so every time shes been in controversy it does her good not bad
8120973 outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy
8120974 the whole notion of a democratic republic is that this wasnt just about politicians that anyone could shoot their mouth off about whatever they wanted to
8120975 were in a sad situation if were turning to entertainers for political wisdom
8120976 orders for phased relaxation of curfew have been issued to all the district magistrates of the valley the decision was taken tuesday evening at a high level meet chaired by governor n n vohra
8120977 the district magistrates will decide the timing for curfew relaxation in consultation with the security forces in order to ensure that the people can move about without any hindrance during the relaxation period
8120978 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8120979 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8120980 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8120981 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8120982 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8120983 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8120984 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits
8120985 jane your beans were delicious as usual but what did you put in them this time

8120989 we are pleased to resolve our outstanding dispute with microsoft and to put this litigation behind us
8120990 we are pleased to have reached a resolution to our legal dispute with immersion that includes a 20 75 million payment to microsoft
8120991 we are gratified that we have successfully resolved our claims under the 2003 settlement we negotiated with immersion which provided benefits to both companies and specific rights to microsoft
8120992 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8120993 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8120994 and that is especially important for us to believe on this day because were meeting on a historic day
8120995 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got into arguments from time to time who contributed so generously to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8120996 so lets devote all the passion and the energy we have and theres a lot of it
8120997 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8120998 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8120999 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8121000 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8121001 hillary got a raw deal right we dont want obama right it seems like were on the same team
8121002 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8121003 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8121004 proud supporter of obama clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8121005 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8121006 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8121007 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8121008 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8121009 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8121010 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8121011 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8121012 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8121013 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8121014 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8121015 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8121016 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8121017 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8121018 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8121019 if it sounds good keep it and if it sounds bad change it
8121020 you shall not oppress your neighbor but you shall love your neighbor as yourself
8121021 god has ordered all things to be produced so that there should be food in common for all and that the earth should be the common possession of all nature therefore has produced a common right for all but greed has made it a right for few
8121022 the right to private property acquired by work or received from others by inheritance or gift does not do away with the original gift of the earth to the whole of mankind the universal destination of goods remains primordial even if the promotion of the common good requires respect for the right to private property and its exercise
8121023 is not this the fast that i choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the thongs of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily your righteousness shall go before you the glory the lord shall be your rear guard then you shall call and the lord will answer you shall cry and he will say here i am if you take away from the midst of you the yoke the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday and the lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire with good things and make your bones strong and you shall be like a watered garden like a spring of water whose waters fail not
8121024 for the well being of the individual two things are necessary the first and most essential is to act virtuously it is through virtue in fact that we live a good life the other and secondary requirement is rather a means and lies in a sufficiency of material goods such as are necessary to virtuous action
8121025 it is the bread of the poor that you are holding back it is the clothes of the naked that you are hoarding it is the relief and liberation of the wretched that you are thwarting by burying your money away
8121026 now what a ruler can do in virtue of his office so that justice may be served in the matter of riches is to take from someone who is unwilling to dispense from what is superfluous for life or state and to distribute it to the poor in this way he just takes away the dispensation power of the rich man to whom the wealth has been entrusted because he is not worthy for according to the teaching of the saints the riches that are superfluous do not belong to the rich man as his own but rather to the one appointed by god as dispenser so that he can have the merit of a good dispensation
8121027 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit upon his glorious throne and all the nations will be assembled before him and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink a stranger and you welcomed me naked and you clothed me ill and you cared for me in prison and you visited me then the righteous will answer him and say lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink when did we see you a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothe you when did we see you ill or in prison and visit you and the king will say to them in reply amen i say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me then he will say to those on his left depart from me you accursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me no drink a stranger and you gave me no welcome naked and you gave me no clothing ill and in prison and you did not care for me then they will answer and say lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison and not minister to your needs he will answer them amen i say to you what you did not do for one of these least ones you did not do for me and these will go off to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life

8121225 in the season opener saturday i dont think albany is going to care and were surely not going to care each year is a new year new challenges and its nice to see our past couple of years has given us a respect or quality that people have for what weve done programatically starting tomorrow it doesnt really mean a shout
8121226 you know we really dont have any household names at wide receiver but we have a lot of talent there and were trying to sort that out
8121227 we have quarterback liam coen back under center so anytime you have liam under center i think we have a chance to win
8121228 the last few years we had the same guys we really havent had to have competition like weve had in camp so far
8121229 obviously losing the corps that we had last year thats tough to replace those guys played in a national championship game in 2006 played at montana they played in some really difficult atmospheres and performed at a top level not taking anything away from those guys its a different corps this year its a different unit we might be a little deeper theyll be exciting to watch
8121230 at one point i argued with the decision but i am still about three weeks away
8121231 i have been running routes and i have not had any drawbacks which is good
8121232 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
8121233 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8121234 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8121235 but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8121236 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8121237 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8121238 all the players here are still competing for some type of roster spot on the team
8121239 i am not saying there are players that wont make the 53 man roster but they are in competition for the practice squad spots even if they dont make the roster as we all know there is a good opportunity for a lot of them to come back to us as things change during the course of the season
8121240 again the giants game is another opportunity i think every opportunity is important
8121241 ive missed so much time i played the one game i think i got off to a pretty decent start that first game for me its a matter of maintaining that consistency so i definitely want to get out there and pick up where i left off in that first game
8121242 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
8121243 we welcome the release of hu shigen but it is tragic that hu had to suffer so many years of abuse serious health problems and harsh conditions
8121244 in response to a sharp increase in demand for solar power generation systems
8121245 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8121246 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8121247 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8121248 the accusations are baseless and do not make sense the bank of china will respond to the suit to clarify and ensure a correct understanding of the facts by going through the legal procedures
8121249 we will reserve the right to lodge a counter claim and other necessary legal actions we believe the us court will make just rulings in accordance with the law and the facts
8121250 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8121251 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8121252 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8121253 i saw some of my colleagues standing up and applauding for obama for the first time
8121254 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8121255 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8121256 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8121257 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8121258 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8121259 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8121260 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8121261 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8121262 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8121263 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8121264 proud supporter of obama clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8121265 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8121266 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8121267 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8121268 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8121269 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8121270 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8121271 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8121272 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8121273 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8121274 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8121275 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8121276 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8121277 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8121278 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8121279 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8121280 once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system
8121281 airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations
8121282 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8121283 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8121284 even leaders in the oil industry know that senator mccain has it wrong we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8121285 in an effort to disguise a convention without a message and a candidate without any experience on meaningful energy policy repairing an economy or dangerous international affairs obama supporters are reduced to flimsy attacks
8121286 he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should and he doesnt understand how the policies that he has supported and wants to perpetuate have so terribly misfired
8121287 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8121288 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8121289 you know it was once said of the first george bush it was said that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8121290 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus that bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8121291 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home
8121292 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8121293 barack obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you dont use
8121294 barack obamas energy strategy taps all sources and all possibilities
8121295 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8121296 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8121297 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8121298 the word is getting out that we wont even consider anything thats not epa certified for a tax credit
8121299 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
8121300 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
8121301 and i was skeptical when i first heard about them
8121302 it puts something in the middle that forces you to slow down
8121303 there s shown to be a huge safety benefits with roundabouts as well
8121304 we have 19 in kent county that are on the books
8121305 typically two out of three people oppose before a roundabout is put in but two out of three approve after they are put in
8121306 we are in the process of updating our statewide transportation plan
8121307 every so often we need to look at what s changing and how to keep the quality of life we are used to
8121308 what s becoming clear is there s more projects than money how do we address that come 2030
8121309 most of our funding is going to take up operations and maintenance there s not a whole lot left for new projects
8121310 how do we make up that difference in funding that is our biggest challenge for 2030
8121311 the smyrna dover cheswold area is busting and we need more local service
8121312 if you want transit show up to our public hearings
8121313 vote for mccain and hillary can run again in 2012
8121314 fantastic great voice and a great playing style traditional blues done with a hip twist
8121315 poem in memory of the artworks on the hudson building
8121316 what i believe with final words from li young lee
8121317 they walked a mile for a camel the mans cigarette
8121318 tearing down n building at eloise hospital for a new gold course
8121319 random beyond the confidence line on the first day of school
8121320 while scratching my wifes back i calculate the distance between sky and earth
8121321 what i believe with final words from li young lee
8121322 the charges that we have are sufficient to keep him behind bars for a very long period of time
8121323 these charges came up because she filed for divorce up in cheboygan county and there was a custody dispute up in that case we think that these charges stem somehow from those disputes
8121324 theres never a case that you walk in and its cut and dried there are issues in every single case that we have
8121325 we dont charge cases unless were confident of getting a conviction
8121326 trane was always high on jimmys playing and so was i
8121327 but how can she be for him hes a radical muslim
8121328 thats not true at all he is a christian hes never been a muslim what in world gave you that idea
8121329 it would be up to a judge to set an interim mortgage rate this bill wouldnt help people with no income and no prospect of an income
8121330 what you get from foreclosures is blight and devastated communities
8121331 what were trying to do with this legislation is keep homes occupied because once these homes go vacant everyone loses
8121332 when the bank said no we got them to say yes
8121333 when people unite together you can make a difference ive seen 100 people with picket signs beat the biggest bank in america
8121334 is that this small struggle on holden street can inspire a national struggle
8121335 thats the prevailing national obituary for our city folks and nothing is going to change that one bit till we drag this giant rock away from the front of our tomb
8121336 normally when you see a black man or woman president an asteroid is about to hit the statue of liberty
8121337 you came in carrying a rubber stamp and left carrying a shillelagh
8121338 don showed up in my office one day and asked if we could discuss the possibility of starting an african american literature special collection
8121339 in the next two years we acquired everything in this room
8121340 all his papers were burned toward the end of his life he was despondent about how people viewed his poetry not his accomplishments as a publisher which were well accepted its a huge loss for us
8121341 the intention of this collection was to be detroit centric
8121342 a reasonably healthy local economy has its benefits but theres also a cost a rising cost in fact
8121343 in june seattles 5 8 percent inflation rate was the highest among 10 major metro areas according to the number crunchers at the u s bureau of labor statistics bls
8121344 want relief inflation in detroit was just 3 0 percent in june lowest among the bls 10 cities the trade off of course is that youre in detroit
8121345 pride defiance and apologetics are close to the surface when one talks about jazz in philadelphia an underdog music in an underdog town
8121346 philly is where coltrane mccoy tyner lee morgan frustrated drummer bill cosby and so many others got their start where clubs drew big talent and jazz rang out from countless neighborhood bars the older and not so older generations know a time when phillys jazz mecca status wasnt in dispute
8121347 while you struggled just to get a c or a b
8121348 it was camaraderie it wasnt just the two cities it affected everybody across the nation with the same kind of determination to learn and to move ahead
8121349 you gotta be a leader you gotta stand for something and represent for something and thats what the kids need to see to get motivated to do bigger and better things in their own lives
8121350 they called me over to their studio but they werent talking money
8121351 thats when i first realized our family had something special
8121352 this is where your mother and i first held you brother and sister
8121353 music is too broad for me just to play my music that would be foolish
8121354 what can i do today that i didnt do yesterday
8121355 what can i learn today that i didnt know yesterday
8121356 who is this other guy whos come to take my place as the weird composer or performer who is this guy whos going to supplant me
8121357 its a warm and vibrant area you feel good there
8121358 you walk around and its just a wonderful warm feeling
8121359 a number of schemes and institutions have gone in there because it has a kind of small community feel but nothing has ever taken hold there
8121360 we dont know anything about what restaurants would go here there was some talk about stars on the sidewalk for some of the citys music legends i think it would be great to have artists here and creative people and make it a creative center with lofts residential and business combined business owners need to work in concert with each other to accomplish a mission not just open your business and hope for the best
8121361 we do things piece by piece instead of having an overall vision mayor dennis archer had a master plan that was never implemented there are still too many powerful interests rather than planners and community people interested in how to live here and work here we certainly should honor the history that the paradise valley area held although harmonie park is a little off the west corner of it
8121362 theres no harmony here so we may as well be in paradise
8121363 it used to be african town but hud said we cant call it that because it would be racist
8121364 well i dont understand it but im not going to go for it either
8121365 as long as you trust and believe in god you cannot go wrong
8121366 philly may have the advantage as far as quantity of jazz musicians but if you look at the bass players from detroit such as paul chambers and ron carter alone they probably equal the talent of 15 different bass players from philly
8121367 when i first saw him perform live it freaked me out its funny when i think about it because my wife told me the first time she saw me perform live my band played this big fanfare and i sashayed onto the stage she said some people in the audience thought i was crazy
8121368 i called her from the emergency room i did a spin and twisted my ankle she told me that my big behind needed to stop acting like james brown because he was shorter than me and when i fell to my knees i had a longer drop to the stage floor i havent done my james brown impression since although i still get the urge
8121369 i just wanted to be in new york i knew if i wanted to play with the musicians i admired id have to move there
8121370 he asked me if i was working this weekend i said no he said well youre working with me i was only 17 the experience was like being called up to the major league and not having spent enough time in the triple a league i was scared to death and bobby was hollering at me i guess i did alright bobby didnt fire me
8121371 i was working with pianist benny green trumpeter roy hargrove and bobby watson i knew school wasnt going to work out
8121372 it took me two weeks finally to get the nerve to tell my mom
8121373 i told christian about it and he said we should do it christian is writing all the charts
8121374 its obviously not what i wanted but you just have to go with it keep getting prepared just like you do when you play every week
8121375 hes a guy who has position flexibility as a center and guard
8121376 well explore him playing some guard more than anything hes a guy were capable of winning with if we have to call on him and theres comfort in that
8121377 i need to be able to fill in and play any inside position if need be
8121378 i definitely need some reps because i havent had any guard reps in more than a year
8121379 thats a decision we have to make at an appropriate time and i think we have to gather all of the information based on the quality of play and the health of charlie well hold our cards until necessary as far as that
8121380 the thing you have to do is make sure you communicate well
8121381 thats our plan as a unit were completely different from anyone else we have to talk its not an individual type deal if we dont work together its not going to get done
8121382 i kind of remember from last year it was a process with everyone getting on the same page and being comfortable
8121383 it will probably be the same type of thing this year
8121384 its more communication especially in our offense there are a lot of calls predicated upon what the center sees everything else is relayed off of that the center has to be on the same page as everyone else
8121385 i feel good the big thing with offensive line play is repetition and seeing the looks and going out and doing it you can study so much but to actually go out there and do it playing with the guys next to you helps every day i feel like im getting better
8121386 once we get on the same page well be all right right now its one man here or one man there before it will be a 10 yard or 15 yard gain
8121387 we really have to emphasize talking if you make a mistake you have to say hey this is where im going to be when you look at the film you have to say this is what i was thinking thats the only way you can do it when you have a short period of time
8121388 im really happy and just relieved that the competition is over
8121389 now i can focus on getting cohesion with these guys and running this offense smoothly its coming along every day every day were learning more about each other im learning more about the offense and all the little intricacies that are in it its always going to be a work in progress but i feel good about where were at and how were progressing every day
8121390 theres great respect for the rooney family in the national football league mr goodell said after a 2
8121391 and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the steelers continue to be operated by the rooneys and the way theyve been operated
8121392 i think there was a genuine commitment on behalf of everybody to get this resolved in a satisfactory manner said mr
8121393 but we were very clear too that this issue is subject to a three fourths vote of the ownership as any ownership transfer is and thats something that is very important to the league and we will make sure our league interests are respected
8121394 theyve run a model franchise and i think everyone in pittsburgh recognizes how proud they are of the steelers and we in the nfl recognize how fortunate weve been to have dan rooneys leadership and now arts leadership mr
8121395 that is certainly a consideration and the ownership wants to make sure this team is run consistently with those principles and that if dan rooney wants an opportunity to continue to run the franchise i think thats an interest some owners have
8121396 we are only because the issue has just become more complex and problematic mr
8121397 i think theyre just as motivated to get this done within a certain time frame as we are
8121398 we just think its in the best interests to have this resolved in a way that will allow people to focus on steelers football
8121399 it becomes more complex as families expand as generations get older and the financial consequences become more significant so i think when you combine all of that these issues dont tend to get easier they get a bit more difficult
8121400 i think that its clear we had an update on where they are with respect to any proposed transactions mr
8121401 and they have a better understanding on where we sit
8121402 i cant think of many owners who have a greater respect than dan rooney within our membership for what hes accomplished both in pittsburgh with the steelers with that community and also at the league level mr
8121403 hes been involved in critical things on the league level hes had a tremendous influence on the game of football hes in the hall of fame for a reason
8121404 this issue of the ageing of australia and the cost of the ageing of australia is a greater crisis than climate change but its not as sexy a subject as climate change and most people in australia would prefer not to grow old and die
8121405 were calling on the government and the opposition to give this the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt with the issue of a massively ageing population
8121406 we pension them off and tell them to sit in front of their television set and watch home and away while the nation goes to the pot economically
8121407 this nation has to face the fact that we cannot economically sustain a retirement age of 65
8121408 he was playing cricket in the schoolyard here and he tried to stop the principal ringing the school bell to end lunch
8121409 he bet his friends that he could stop the principal from ringing the bell
8121410 i feel very privileged to be here as principal of the school on this 100th anniversary
8121411 it was great honour to know when i walked in that there was a photo of sir donald in the foyer it was wonderful in some ways i felt home
8121412 in those days there was no electric street lighting no electricity
8121413 one of sir dons favourite recollections was how he used to ride on the gas lighters horse lighting the street lamps
8121414 well knowing how modest he was he probably would have been overwhelmed by it all no doubt
8121415 detroit is well respected by many and even feared by some because we dont sound alike
8121416 its not only what you say its how you say it
8121417 its like going to a big reunion winning is just the cherry on the cake
8121418 its networking and listening to the greatest poetry on the planet
8121419 you cant go anywhere and hear the poetry you hear at nationals
8121420 you have to know youre taking a message to another audience that may not have heard it before you cant take it too personally or seriously
8121421 one team disqualified themselves on purpose by using a prop
8121422 props are not allowed in slam but its all in fun
8121423 as soon as i stepped off the stage i had offers from l a and new york asking when i can do a booking
8121424 its a competition but its not more than the relationships we foster
8121425 we have everything from hip hop to academic to folklore we have fantastic writers and it shows in our work
8121426 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8121427 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8121428 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8121429 nathan retires as a life member of our club since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8121430 well always remember the animated bass responses the selfless acts of courage and the long runs out of defence which were trademarks of his 11 years as a player
8121431 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
8121432 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
8121433 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
8121434 there is no handicap in the practice of democracy in this country
8121435 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
8121436 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
8121437 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8121438 the strong man john mitchell and the secrets of watergate
8121439 sen obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8121440 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8121441 our denim has been the no 1 category that has hurt us
8121442 we are not committing to new deals until we see the results for the second half of this year
8121443 wed like to think that our products should not only be in the white house but should be in every freezer case in the country
8121444 does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8121445 give money to someone and be confident it will end up in a college savings plan
8121446 it also allows parents to attach a plan and let people in their social network know theyd be happy to receive contributions to it
8121447 she can redeem it by telling the site to deposit it into her 529 plan thats the only way the money can come out
8121448 i can look them up and give to their plan directly specifying its for her birthday or some other occasion
8121449 our sales have been on a downward trajectory for a year everything i have in here is considered a luxury and when people have to pick and chose where their last dollar goes it is not going to be here
8121450 we were set up like a franchise we pay the symphony for the rights of the curtain call name and they get royalties for some items
8121451 we will sell branded items and cds during the concerts
8121452 we have no shop in the plans at the moment
8121453 the industry is fundamentally much stronger coming into the present situation
8121454 the banks that are in trouble are by and large the outlier banks banks that had nonconventional lending and funding strategies the mainstream banks are by and large in pretty good shape
8121455 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings but these results were not unexpected
8121456 still be low compared to the high levels we saw during the s amp l days
8121457 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
8121458 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
8121459 at the end of the day we did this for financial reasons
8121460 this can reduce the amount of space we need in the building
8121461 four essential oils a combination of eucalyptol menthol methyl salicylate and thymol
8121462 fire dancing circuses and 3 000 person light saber war
8121463 comic books have given me so much over the years that its time i gave something back to the medium
8121464 roger cormans body of work is so visual and visceral
8121465 what will make these titles stand out is that mr corman will be personally involved in their development
8121466 roger and i had always intended to create a comic book franchise based on the black scorpion movies and tv series and with classic costumed superheroes back in vogue thanks to the success of the batman and iron man movies the time seemed right to bring back our costumed superheroine
8121467 i think rev meeks needs to call that boycott off i think its a big mistake to ask kids to miss school
8121468 he cant give me an ultimatum to call the boycott off
8121469 i can give him an ultimatum keep the promise he made in 2006 and put the 10 billion in education we wouldnt even be discussing a boycott
8121470 when will mayor daley step up and show us what theyve done with that money and whether or not the schools have gotten better with all of that funding
8121471 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8121472 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8121473 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8121474 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8121475 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8121476 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8121477 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8121478 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8121479 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8121480 michelle obama needs to introduce herself to the american people
8121481 the best way to answer that given our ballpark is that the best scenario is to have two center fielders
8121482 we need one to patrol left one to patrol center if we can get corner production from one thats good if we can get that from both thats ideal but we feel like we need to have two athletic outfielders who can run the ball down
8121483 the answer is that we would be very comfortable with nate going forward in center field
8121484 as the club shakes out one year two year three years down the road well have to see whats the best club to put on the field at that time
8121485 this is my first year of being out there and i think ive improved every day and will continue to improve
8121486 these are two guys who can track it down and thats what we want
8121487 in fact its probably the day i like least in this job i like friday nights a lot better in terms of the firesides i think those are more representative of our program i understand the business part that you have to play well and you generate interest by how you play but i enjoy the day to day with our players and the off season and the work ethic and practice i like that a lot more than actual game day which is probably backwards but thats how it is
8121488 i would add this question how long have you been in the geographic area and how well known is your brand typically a prospect will not take off part of his her day unless they have heard of you you have credibility and or your content and agenda is compelling enough for them to take a risk and sacrifice hours of productivity at work for your event people are too busy to leave the office and your event better be worth it
8121489 are you a known entity and would they come to see you
8121490 the result for the permatang pauh by election is already out and the decision favours datuk seri anwar ibrahim so he will be sworn in tomorrow
8121491 the way i see it people are discounting the short term risk premium now that the by election is out of the way
8121492 the market appears to have pared the expectations for a rate hike
8121493 this view could be supported by signs of economic slowdown
8121494 jack and jill 1 bath while fourth bedroom had private bath
8121495 im out of here im withdrawing my combat forces form the area but peacekeepers are staying
8121496 there can be no return to the status quo ante
8121497 the caucasus is a russian region it has always been that way we are not going to let adventurers like georgian president mikheil saakashvili or us secretary of state condoleezza rice change that we are going to be an independent state within russia its logical
8121498 there are several possible outcomes considering these territories the first is that the europeans have been dropping hints about the possible internationalization of the conflict this would involve the stationing of observers and maybe peacekeepers in ossetia and abkhazia and their futures being brought under intense discussion
8121499 the eu and the us remain committed to georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity the most likely outcome i can imagine will be the north cyprus situation the world will recognize georgias territorial integrity while russia and maybe a few of its satellite states will acknowledge south ossetia and abkhazia as independent
8121500 the south ossetians already can see what an example of russian rule in the caucasus is like if they look to north ossetia how many schools there teach in ossetian the answer is none in a few years the concern of cultural autonomy will mount and they will begin to realize the trap they are in
8121501 the president turned this country from a sort of post soviet ruin into a modern country
8121502 however saakashvilis definitely in until september then i cant say there will be serious questions asked about what has happened and those questions will have consequences
8121503 under shevernadze we practiced a political balancing act between russia and the west just look at where we are on a map when the balance got upset we angered a neighbor and it destroyed so much of the good development that was going on we could have avoided this and just got rich
8121504 though my political and cultural values are completely western i am starting to think that georgia put all of its eggs in one basket
8121505 russia is a born again 19th century power that acts in the post 20th century world where arguments of force and capacity cannot any longer be the only way to define the status or conduct of great powers the absence of soft power is particularly dangerous for a would be revisionist state for if a state wants today to remake the world order it must be able both to rely on the existing and emerging constellation of powers and be able to capture the international publics imagination
8121506 o c ssio fez uma tima partida e estr ia sempre algo complicado troquei ele pelo carlos alberto no segundo tempo apenas porque havia levado um cart o amarelo o que podia deix lo com um pouco de receio
8121507 ele foi muito bem dando seguran a a nica coisa que atrapalhou um pouco foi o cart o amarelo
8121508 i am very pleased with the way we played today
8121509 our focus and intensity level was right where it needed to be the entire match our back row had a great game defensively allowing us to maintain ball control our setters haley and courtney ran a smooth offense and varied our attacks teter dominated at the net
8121510 the contract will provide our community of naval service and marine customers with unprecedented access to esri services
8121511 we previously worked as a subcontractor with several of our partners on seaport e now we can contract directly with seaport e authorized users
8121512 we chose arcgis api for flex because it allowed us to leverage the power of arcgis server while delivering a rich interactive experience to our users
8121513 development was both fast and enjoyable and we are pleased with the functionality and performance of the application
8121514 the cabinet discussed at its regular file of all outstanding issues with the state of kuwait
8121515 stressed his desire to good relations and good neighbourliness and the development of fraternal relations between the two countries
8121516 expressed concern for the survival of these files without solutions to the detriment of the interests of the fraternal peoples
8121517 the house of representatives agreed before the end of the chapter on the formation of a legislative committee to follow up the differences on the law of provincial council elections
8121518 the kurdish list in parliament were made concrete cooperation on the issue of elections perhaps not wanting corrections in this year or even years to come if not enjoy flexibility regarding the passage of the law
8121519 the issue of kirkuk province which adheres to the existing kurdish issue and its accession to the kurdistan region theme for all iraqis and that the survival of the city of kirkuk sisterhood is the survival of iraq either join kirkuk to kurdistan region will lead to big problems and disputes between the components and this is what we fear
8121520 the kurdish list in parliament to show some flexibility to resolve the issue of kirkuk a compromise without facing a dead end
8121521 we work together arab kurdish and turkmen must be the bulk of our attention is to serve iraq and working on reconstruction job creation for unemployed sons and improve essential services for citizens everybody thinks that the interests of the country first before thinking of partisan interests

8121527 i was up all night chatting with him then we switc
8121528 hmm they seem to be pointed north all the time so it has to be the earths magnetic field doing it
8121529 we conclude that the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment

8121532 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
8121533 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
8121534 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
8121535 we will not interfere militarily with you do not interfere with us
8121536 there are no accidents in my philosophy every effect must have its cause the past is the cause of the present and the present will be the cause of the future all these are links in the endless chain stretching from the finite to the infinite

8121549 i saw such and such and i should have called
8121550 confidence is still quite depressed but its a glimmer of hope from the lows we saw in june
8121551 they are we get a lot of people who come in and use them
8121552 just a lot more people using them because they end this month
8121553 i try to use them i think its a great concept i just think if youre not to use coupons all the time you dont just run to it
8121554 we have like 2 i keep forgetting to use them to tell you the truth
8121555 there is a lot of stuff i dont use in there that doesnt do me any good but i do support and ive even ordered mine for next year
8121556 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
8121557 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8121558 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8121559 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8121560 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8121561 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8121562 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8121563 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8121564 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8121565 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8121566 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8121567 its a generational change as well as a directional change for the country
8121568 well first we have to tell all of our young people all of everybody that everybody has worth
8121569 god created everybody and god doesnt make mistakes so if he created everybody then all of us have worth
8121570 should be a place where you can make it if you try
8121571 while we continue supporting the historic increase we expect that there will likely be continuing discussions on many of the elements that go into the 40 percent increase
8121572 i think its unrealistic for a manufacturer to assume that the gas prices go down
8121573 quien habr a estado en suiza durante el per odo en que se realizaron las llamadas desde la ciudad de orange ser a un familiar directo del denunciado

8121576 s lo s que vive en bella vista y que tiene un auto rural
8121577 me acabo de enterar por ustedes tampoco ten a la menor idea de que utilizara un cartel de veh culo oficial
8121578 de all arrastr ndolo y a los golpes lo subieron al corsa y escaparon mi sobrina denunci el caso ante un agente policial
8121579 nos cont que le pegaron todo el tiempo con las culatas de sus armas le desfiguraron la cara a golpes casi nos morimos cuando lo vimos estaba irreconocible
8121580 el tambi n nos dijo que no conoc a a ninguno de los agresores tampoco le reclamaron nada en particular s lo lo golpearon nosotros creemos que lo asaltaron no hay otro tipo de explicaci n
8121581 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8121582 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8121583 rural america needs the change barack obama offers our communities have suffered a ten percent drop in household income thats three times the national average
8121584 with vermont going so strongly for barack obama i think its frustrating for people here that they keep saying white voters arent convinced by him yet
8121585 but having senator leahy up there who has such a presence and who is so helpful to the campaign and it was so exciting
8121586 vermonters are really excited to be hearing this message come out from such a diverse group of leaders including a number of vermonters so its just a really exciting time to be a democrat and especially to be a democrat here in vermont
8121587 im someone whos never been involved in politics never followed politics never really even followed news or what was going on and ive been brought out of the shadows
8121588 if the process is flawed then its as bad as having flawed amendments
8121589 if people arent diligent in trying to understand what theyre signing and then eventually what theyre going to vote on then we could have some changes that i think a lot of people wouldnt be real happy with
8121590 were trying to get this county government shaped up to where it would be merged the city government would merge with the county government inaudible and youd have one government like they have in nashville
8121591 ok so youre saying really the idea of these two petitions is to merge the governments
8121592 they dont know the answers to every single question they are armed with fact sheets that have all the information as well as the language thats on the petition and i would encourage everybody to read that information before they sign anything
8121593 all this petition will do is put it on the ballot so that people can vote on it
8121594 seems like i read in the paper there was more to it than that
8121595 theres a lot my knowledge is very very limited on it the back of these explains it in detail what the actual amendment will be n law terms
8121596 i think the vast majority of them do a very good job of explaining the information when theyre asked accurate questions
8121597 youre talking about two people that were interviewed that i heard so i dont think thats a fair sampling of hundreds and tens of thousands of people who have signed the petition
8121598 if they sign something thinking theyre doing the right thing and there hasnt been full disclosure for them to understand what theyve signed then the process makes this whole thing flawed
8121599 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time
8121600 we actually just had a rehearsal at director catherine hardwickes house the other day for a new scene
8121601 i know theyve been showing it to some people and some people go i want to see a little more of this or i dont quite understand this
8121602 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
8121603 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film
8121604 at first we didnt film that and now some people are saying they want to see a bit more of jacob and they want him in the prom scene at the end

8121658 saya tidak mahu kerajaan terus digelar double standard atau tidak adil kerana mahasiswa tidak dibenarkan menganggotai parti politik sebaliknya mahasiswa di luar negara diberikan kebebasan itu
8121659 it will be a huge project to collect the evidence that can prove microsoft is monopolising the mainlands pc software market so it would be best to leave that job to the government
8121660 microsoft is not aware of an investigation by the ministry of commerce or other anti monopoly law agencies at this time
8121661 from a legal point of view it should not be a problem to prove that microsoft has operated as a monopoly
8121662 beijing may file a lawsuit if microsoft has really stifled the scientific innovation potential of smaller chinese software firms

8121666 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8121667 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
8121668 mccain even though hes not my first choice is who im voting for
8121669 in swing states like ohio and missouri its not going to take a lot to change the winner so its a significant problem for obama said joshua dunn political science professor at the university of colorado at colorado springs
8121670 if mccain can just carve out enough of a percentage of clinton supporters he might be able to win
8121671 the situation is ripe for a democrat to be elected but theyve tossed mccain a life preserver
8121672 i know theyre mad at me but im not a politician
8121673 obama is for change hes for hope if i just wanted a president with platitudes anybody can do that
8121674 i think its just grown and it feels more like a team to me a team that is fired up and ready to go
8121675 my mission is not to go against the democratic party i believe in the democratic party

8121681 in the next year i think were going to see low and moderate income families facing a great deal more hardship
8121682 i think we can expect those numbers of poverty to increase in 2008

8121684 the bad news is you have to go to court good luck
8121685 the client was crying and her lips and face were visibly swollen
8121686 there was nothing in his face there was nothing in his voice
8121687 when he went back to the motorcycle i sat with my head slumped on the steering wheel i pulled away because he didnt do anything
8121688 she told me there were gobs of hair all over that bed and blood from her lip
8121689 part of her disability has to do with how she has relationships
8121690 the disabled are the first to be preyed upon and abused that is disability 101
8121691 the fact is she was in distress and he should have done something
8121692 i want him to apologize i want him to look her in the eyes and remember her face
8121693 as a starting pitcher you kind of go into a game looking to keep it to one or less runs and i wasnt able to do that lowe said after the dodgers fell 2 1 to the washington nationals before 26 110 on tuesday night at nationals park
8121694 i still look at it as a disappointing start sometimes a starting pitcher has to pick up the offense
8121695 in this game trying harder normally wont get you anywhere and that is such a hard thing to fight lowe said
8121696 you cant give 110 percent and i think that is where we are there is no lack of preparation and there is no such thing as guys not trying but as a collective group sometimes you have to try less to get more
8121697 there is no feeling sorry for yourself and you cant wish things didnt happen the way they did because they are already in the record books you just have to come out wednesday and continue playing
8121698 certainly this was a winnable game we just couldnt get it done
8121699 all you can do is control what you do dodgers pitching coach rick honeycutt said of his snakebitten starters
8121700 they cant try to go out and be too perfect but at the same time they have to continue to do what they have been doing and keep the other team down
8121701 he came in before mondays game and talked to me and i did a couple of interviews torre said
8121702 i have always been a proponent of the fact you have to eliminate the highs and lows in this game because you have to keep it on an even keel and maintain it for 162 games torre said
8121703 i dont know any clubhouse where if you have lost three in a row and five of six youre going to see guys jumping around and doing things other people consider positive
8121704 i just wanted to remind them were still in position to control our own destiny said torre referring to the fact that while the club came in trailing first place arizona by three games in the loss column the dodgers and diamondbacks still play six more times
8121705 lets not lose our spirit i sensed we were in a good frame of mind the last couple of games that made it more frustrating than anything else
8121706 there is some soreness but the same kind of soreness you would have after your first outing of spring training wade said
8121707 its nothing abnormal theyre just going to wait and see how i feel

8121713 they would have been destined for doom theres no other way around it
8121714 we dropped a trough over the fence and filled it with water
8121715 a little angering any time you see someone dump something that cant take care of themselves and just leave them pretty much to die
8121716 it was a great thrill winning down at the coliseum thats water under the bridge this 2008 season is a whole new dynamic
8121717 were halfway there weve done half the work to put us in position to have a successful season the standard for this year is to get to a bowl game
8121718 this is the best team ive been a part of here
8121719 we were right there we played in big games we won some big games we lost some big games we know what it takes to finish now we have to do it you cant teach the game experience we got last year
8121720 last year i was so concerned about getting the play in getting the play called getting in and out of the huddle
8121721 that stuff is just second nature now now im more concerned about reads and checkdowns and finding open guys and getting us into the right plays i think that will really help the offense progress
8121722 when guys come up to tackle him they dont know what theyre in for
8121723 he knows what to expect now i feel like he has grown and has adapted the offense and well be even better this year

8121726 we were going through a couple of ideas and we were just not where we wanted to be in terms of being disruptive
8121727 it is a political year in the u s and it is an olympic year so you need to be disruptive in some manner in order to get your message through or youre going to be lost
8121728 were poking fun a little bit at ourselves we know people get it

8121732 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
8121733 anwar apparently buried his umno challenger whats his name again also it seems that anwars who take unethical shortcuts

8121736 im going to have him in the lineup pretty much every day
8121737 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play
8121738 youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8121741 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe
8121742 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8121743 this is not the end of the story in georgia
8121744 russia wants to aggravate rather than calm down passions this is an extremely alarming development
8121745 end of the epoch of a weak russia and restores a multipolar world order
8121746 russia has no such goals it will be up to south ossetia and abkhazia

8121753 the difference in knowing about god and knowing god personally is like buying sunblock amp not applying it youll still burn
8121754 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt

8121756 if you want to build a ship dont drum up people together to collect wood and dont assign them tasks and work but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea
8121757 always recognize that human individuals are ends and do not use them as means to your end
8121758 assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted calculated and expressed in formulas how absurd would such a scientific estimation of music be
8121759 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
8121760 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
8121761 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given
8121762 as long as the world shall last there will be wrongs and if no man objected and no man rebelled those wrongs would last forever
8121763 no man is free who is not master of himself

8121771 we realized theres good opportunity for us to be positioning ourselves as a welcoming destination
8121772 the gay and lesbian travel market is very well travelled

8121776 i love the way he fights how he comes forward and throws punches
8121777 i would be happy to work with darren and he would get the best sparring partners around
8121778 im aware that several american promoters are also anxious to talk to darren but he must be cautious
8121779 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from such deliveries when compared to clinicians
8121780 midwives views were more closely aligned to those of pregnant women while urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons were prepared to take very low risks before they would opt for an elective caesarean
8121781 it is important to ensure that women are provided with good quality information by their midwife and or doctor so that they can make an informed decision with relevant medical advice about the type of birth that is best for them and their baby
8121782 it is also important to remember that childbirth can be unpredictable and therefore any birth plan should be flexible enough to allow for unexpected complications
8121783 i suppose players saw a greater chance of winning titles with the hurlers they were always regarded as having a good chance in leinster whereas the footballers werent
8121784 that in turn reflected itself in the attitude of the wexford public who didnt support the footballers to the same degree as the hurlers
8121785 he kept saying that football was his game i knew that but he would have made one hell of a hurler too deep down though he wanted to put everything into football i know people will say im biased but i have no hesitation in saying that matty forde is the best footballer i ever saw if armagh in the all ireland quarter final people would be talking about it for years
8121786 it is widely believed that there has been something akin to an actual conspiracy to enslave the world
8121787 conspiracy or not there can be little question that the power these discoveries have put into the hands of financiers will if not controlled enable them in their own time and choice effectively to conquer the world
8121788 whether or not there is a conspiracy among the chosen people to reestablish by gold the dominance they were wont to derive from god and the biblical history exodus xxxii recalls a strictly parallel attempt frustrated by the energetic action of their chief legislator it must be admitted that it would be a revenge on science for its iconoclastic tendencies not without a certain sardonic humor if we wake up one day and find instead of the ten commandments a single rule of gold these are conjectural possibilities and no doubt as in the time of moses there are still jews and jews let us hope so at least
8121789 we shall create by all the secret subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of gold which is all in our hands a universal economic crisis whereby we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of europe those mobs will rush delightedly to shed the blood of those whom in the simplicity of their ignorance they have envied from their cradles and whose property they will then be able to loot
8121790 ours they will not touch because the moment of attack will be known to us and we shall take measures to protect our own

8121794 instead of just typing hotels in washington did you want hotels in washington dc or hotels in washington state dont remember that song title or persons name let google help you search
8121795 ive always found that odd id rather google show some metric related to how popular that suggested query is since thats the basis of why youre being shown these words
8121796 over at microsofts live search you dont get query suggestions when typing in the search box but they will show related searches links in the top right hand corner of search results in some cases
8121797 the detroit city council has wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars paying for an attorney to conduct a political witch hunt
8121798 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8121799 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8121800 the governor believes just because the legislature is late two months in doing their job of approving a budget voters shouldnt be allowed to decide on key issues
8121801 its time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences and start getting votes from legislators of his own party so that our state can move forward on these critical issues
8121802 i must confess ive stopped listening to the governor on what we should and shouldnt do
8121803 medical blogs have the opportunity to be such a benefit to patients
8121804 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients
8121805 its time for us to take some responsibility and really think of how we can maintain the integrity of this process
8121806 included sufficient information for patients to identify their doctors or themselves
8121807 like everything else on the internet its just kind of the wild west
8121808 its very leveling you can write in print what you would never say to a surgeons face about him being an overweening jerk
8121809 it is semen you rocket scientist and we really really did not need to know that
8121810 to hear about the effluent from your nether regions after your feel good friday night
8121811 it really gives a glimpse behind the medical curtain that otherwise the general public wouldnt see
8121812 some of the opinions are very raw and in some cases dont reflect on the profession in a very positive way but they do reflect reality we often say what people dont like to hear
8121813 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings

8121817 a suicide car bomb targeted a recruiting centre in the twon of jalowlaa 70 km to the northeast of baquba at 10 30 a m tuesday killing 27 recruits wounding 45
8121818 rushed into a crowd of potential recruits and detonated his explosives laden vest
8121819 theyd received 30 bodies of dead recruits a higher figure than police reported to mcclatchy newspapers
8121820 there was black smoke everywhere dead bodies on the ground and people panicking and helping to transfer the injured to the hospital
8121821 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
8121822 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8121823 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking eveidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the are from which pershmerga have just withdrawn
8121824 this is the latest in a series of attacks launched mainly by sunni islamists in diyala
8121825 the attack followed a suicide bombing on sunday night at a tribal sheiks banquest in the western baghdad suburb of abu ghraib
8121826 prime minister nouri malikis negotiators are also bogged down in talks over a long term security agreement with the united states despite a december deadline looming for a deal the shiite led government has also initiated a crackdown on leaders and members of the u s funded sons of iraq movement which includes many former insurgents who allied themselves with america in 2007 to fight al qaeda in iraq since may iraqi security forces have started arresting sunni fighters leaders from the sons of iraq have warned that the measures could drive some of their men back to fighting the government
8121827 fixed deadline for the departure of all u s troops troops from iraq
8121828 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8121829 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8121830 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8121831 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only
8121832 despite the tough words aides insisted a compromise could be found on the two main stumbling blocks to an accord governing the u s military presence in iraq after a united nations mandate expires at the end of the year
8121833 the general manager of the health administration dr hassan zein al abideen
8121834 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8121835 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative
8121836 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them

8121841 doc what advice can you give me that will help me with investing
8121842 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
8121843 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
8121844 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
8121845 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
8121846 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it

8121852 our guys battled kept coming back but it wasnt easy
8121853 it really wasnt one of our better games but its in the win column and give these guys credit for really staying after it
8121854 i dont know what happened but maybe i have to have more concentration so it doesnt happen again
8121855 we did some things offensively but obviously we didnt pitch very well
8121856 but this team is leaving everything it has on the field we got rid of some good players and its hurt us but people need to get over that

8121875 i also have a car and i try to drive the motorcycle as much as possible cause you know saves money
8121876 that would mean probably a 25 cent per gallon increase in gasoline

8121878 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8121879 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8121880 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8121881 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8121882 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8121883 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8121884 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8121885 i honestly dont know how we beat him three times
8121886 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8121887 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8121888 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game
8121889 it definitely wasnt my a game or else i would have won the game

8121894 the plan for national rollout has always been there its just been about appropriate timing and now the iburst sale gives us that opportunity
8121895 were not particularly interested in iburst itself which is losing its place in the market and is dying under the weight of 3 5g products that the large telcos are running
8121896 rather we are more interested in the network assets and ibursts 1 9ghz spectrum
8121897 if you have a look at bigairs stock market performance its hard to see how they could be looked at as a serious contender
8121898 that increased my payment and it makes me very hard to get everything together
8121899 were able to loan an employee up to five thousand dollars
8121900 its simply for those who have critical needs like electricity is going to be turned off like the mortgage
8121901 companies are beginning to become sensitive to what employees are going through in regard to the mortgage meltdown
8121902 in 2004 29 offered financial advice in 2008 we are seeing 40
8121903 a lot of times good employees are hard to find so the trick for most businesses is how do you hang on to that person
8121904 they become a better employee number one not only with loyalty but you take a lot of the stress out of their life
8121905 if you dont have enough money to pay your mortgage your other bills and now youre adding another bill to be paid even though its a no interest loan thats a problem
8121906 i can concentrate better not just thinking about what i have to do to stay in my house but to work and give my best for my patients
8121907 it was alleged that ashabhai co ltd has deliberately concealed beef gelatin as one of the ingredients of the stars frutty chewy candy product by pasting a sticky label on it which specified all other ingredients as on the product packet except beef gelatin
8121908 the ministry has sought clarification from both ashabhai co ltd and the manufacturer who assured us that the product is of vegetable based as ashabhai co ltd is aware of the religion issue in fiji thus advised the manufacturer not to include beef gelatin in the candy product for this reason the manufacturer pasted a sticky label on the packet to indicate the correct ingredients used
8121909 not all public authorities designated under the litter decree have been implementing the decree as some are unaware of what to do under the decree it is viewed that there is insufficient awareness on the decree
8121910 these constraints are the inadequate number of dedicated lpos specifically for litter enforcement lack of incentives to avoid bribery and lack of recording of lpos
8121911 there have been numerous calls from citizens who are dissatisfied with the increase of litter in public places this is a clear indication that lpos are not effective in enforcing the 1991 litter decree
8121912 i had one bad night but i have moved on and i think tried to move my life in a better direction
8121913 i live with that guilt every day i cant take back what i did
8121914 i had a school friend who died in one of the planes that night i went to norwood to try and re enlist in the marine corps
8121915 i signed up because i cant sit at home and watch americans dying and i want my kids to be proud of me one day
8121916 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8121917 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8121918 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8121919 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack
8121920 a number who said they were going to vote for hillary are now saying theyll vote for obama
8121921 how people vote in roll call who cares no one remembers that
8121922 were going to reap the benefits of two historic campaigns
8121923 every day of his life was devoted to public service so its a terrible irony that he should die this way
8121924 it just shows that law enforcement is a dangerous game but its a risk he was willing to take to serve others
8121925 for a man in his 60s he was as vibrant as any man in his 40s
8121926 you get 22 million people to watch a political convention thats not chopped liver
8121927 those are spectacular numbers considering its not a clinton or the nominee whos speaking
8121928 no one knows mitt romney better than the massachusetts delegation
8121929 and there is not a lot of respect for what he has to say from our delegation
8121930 he was so unpopular when he left massachusetts people were so disappointed
8121931 a great pick for the republican party how can you be the party of the people when your two representatives would not know poverty if it sat in front of them
8121932 wed tell him to go home if we knew which home he was coming from
8121933 the fact that this has come down to mitt romney shows how short the list of vice presidential candidates is for the republican party
8121934 the thing about mitt is he can have debate all by himself he doesnt need to come here to denver
8121935 he can debate both sides of all the important issues just by quoting his past statements
8121936 can say all the things he wants but people from massachusetts will see right through it and the american people will see through his smoke screen at the end of the day theres no substance theres nothing there
8121937 the people of massachusetts have a different view of mitt romney as a strong leader who cut spending kept taxes low and got health insurance to all our citizens
8121938 wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me
8121939 all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose
8121940 rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice
8121941 son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
8121942 be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
8121943 firmeza mostrada por la econom a mexicana en un contexto global tan complejo como el actual
8121944 if you utter worthy not worthless words you will be my spokesperson
8121945 are my words worthy and precious am i representing god well and with excellence am i allowing him to mold me so i reflect his character am i keeping the bar raised to his standard such that i may be his spokesperson
8121946 may the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight o lord my rock and my redeemer
8121947 the mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life
8121948 let your conversation always be full of grace seasoned with salt
8121949 el estado de derecho en m xico se ha visto amenazado por una delincuencia que por a os se ha alimentado de la tolerancia y en algunas ocasiones de la franca corrupci n de algunas autoridades y tambi n de la diferencia y la apat a de muchos ciudadanos
8121950 al legislar la interrupci n legal del aborto lo hicimos en uso de nuestras facultades y ahora corresponde al congreso de la uni n que voltee los ojos hacia la aldf para que nos restituya de pleno derecho nuestras facultades como cualquier congreso local
8121951 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8121952 a eso le apostamos en octubre habr reforma energ tica
8121953 hay tres iniciativas y se tendr a que ver donde hay coincidencias y divergencias para entrar al an lisis final y que la comisi n de energ a del senado empiece a dictaminar mi experiencia me hace ver que puede haber una iniciativa en materia energ tica en este periodo ordinario
8121954 ya tenemos las iniciativas de los tres partidos pol ticos es un buen momento y hay que sacar los mejores elementos de las distintas propuestas
8121955 la propuesta del fap la estamos analizando pero hay que tomar de cada una lo mejor para que lo que resulte sea una iniciativa que logre el fortalecimiento de pemex
8121956 no es cosa menor pemex tiene un panorama endemoniadamente complicado y triste
8121957 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
8121958 projections show that the existence of this facility in the area could lower the cost of gas at a wholesale level by approximately five cents
8121959 we called it to be a minor to potential moderate impact
8121960 low to moderate impact on what we dont have a clue what species are out there what species breed out there
8121961 i support the project as an economic stimulus for the area and making mobile a more desirous place to live and work
8121962 if plenty of folks come down to go out on the charter boats to go out fishing and the fishing again is impacted adversely that would also translate into an adverse situation for us when it comes to tourism
8121963 on balance the projects ability to more safely provide natural gas with few air emissions outweighs the potential impact on marine life
8121964 the applicant seeks a permit to commit aquacide perhaps not mass indiscriminate killing of marine life like some other proposals but reckless behavior
8121965 none of us can afford to be on the sidelines
8121966 we dont need four more years of the last eight years mccain and bush makes perfect sense theyll be in the twin cities awfully hard to tell them apart
8121967 once our warehouses were full we had to rent a badminton court just to store them
8121968 it has cost us a lot of money to launder and store the clothes so we decided it would be better just to auction them
8121969 just a week after the quake we told people to stop sending us secondhand clothes but they kept on coming
8121970 people would just dump them on the ground and leave we received as many clothes in the three months after the quake as we had in the past three years
8121971 i like video games toys model comics book everything this is kidult
8121972 mix the imagination world and the real world this is kidult
8121973 a skeleton surfing on a wave of human bodies all the bodies of all the people that the united states army has ever subjugated throughout history
8121974 the holy spirit intervenes in our favor by appearing to cardinals who had been wavering in their support of you earn forty cardinal votes
8121975 men who are narcissistic thrill seekers also have more sex
8121976 i saw a toy its a robot but my mom she never buy it for me at that moment the toy was 150 hong kong dollars now its 5 300 forty times as much i still buy it why is it forty times expensive because of the kidult market
8121977 the more we dug into beauchamps writings the more clear it became that we might have been in the realm of war stories a genre notoriously rife with embellishment
8121978 who told stories about them all trying to have sex with donkeys when they were younger a costeno cutsom apparently
8121979 how a gang of right wing shitheads strip mined the government while managing to sell out every last one of their dumbshit principles
8121980 marching for peace while paying for war is like pigging out on junk food while praying for health
8121981 once you are embedded in the xcel restricted area you cant leave
8121982 its like adding a few extra fire stations so instead of having 16 fire stations its like having 18
8121983 most modern fire trucks have a class a foam system only that is very common the st paul fire trucks have a combination of class a and class b which is an even higher grade of technology
8121984 the old systems were clunky we were dealing with five gallon buckets and measuring the amount of foam needed this is easy you just press a button and its all done
8121985 its an engineering challenge just to build a system thats actually useful
8121986 what we showed was powering a light bulb but to make it work we need to power a laptop or a battery charger which is actually a little bit different there are still quite a few unknowns
8121987 its very exciting that other people are taking very serious interest and it also demonstrates the potential of wireless power
8121988 i dont think the public is ready to say were going to broadcast kilowatts of power across your living room
8121989 we have a big enough issue with some of the really low power transmitters like cell phones
8121990 we never want to be putting out enough power that we would in any way impact safety
8121991 the problem was that if you moved it a fraction of a degree you could melt a city
8121992 they are a lovely family well known very good people
8121993 fire brigade officers attempted to enter the house but because of the intensity of the fire they were forced back
8121994 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8121995 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8121996 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8121997 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8121998 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india you know can agree to if there were going to be changes but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8121999 we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nuclear suppliers group to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8122000 there are a number of concerns that some countries have about whats been about the agreement but they are good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8122001 and we have discussions with governments about these issues and we will do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns other governments may have about the agreement
8122002 we would hope to interview the relevant parties soon he said paul kent should greg bird be sacked
8122003 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8122004 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8122005 in view of judicial precedence and facts before the court the petitioners are not entitled to any indulgence at this interlocutory stage
8122006 the inability of small growers to pay the revised minimum wage is not a ground to assail the go
8122007 we have done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8122008 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8122009 we want to get a better characterisation of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8122010 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
8122011 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
8122012 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
8122013 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
8122014 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
8122015 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
8122016 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
8122017 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
8122018 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
8122019 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
8122020 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
8122021 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
8122022 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
8122023 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
8122024 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
8122025 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
8122026 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
8122027 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the new phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
8122028 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8122029 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8122030 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8122031 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8122032 when the circumstances make it clear that the motivation for the action was a personal or family relationship
8122033 i am contacting you because i know that you have worked with pat in the past and appreciate how much he has given to our city
8122034 just the good will of a lot of good people in the development community who really feel for pat and what hes going through
8122035 we dont have room for the trail and our business
8122036 another is my old pal rush limbaugh the blimp of bombast
8122037 with the fairness doctrine abolished the garden of free expression bloomed unfortunately several undesirable plants the rush dandelion the savage thistle the oreilly ragweed thrived in ground fertilized with manure
8122038 i sense a new age coming no not the age of aquarius the age of aquariums you guys will be the blowfish
8122039 centers on newly separated claire bertinelli who is raising two teens while running a lumber business
8122040 it was a lousy night we pretty much screwed it up every way you can screw it up theres absolutely no excuse
8122041 hes the best player in the league unfortunately he had a bad night
8122042 he didnt have his best knuckleball tonight but it was plenty for his first time back
8122043 i dont want a f king abortion clinic in my neighborhood
8122044 we have to get going by electing barack obama president
8122045 i did all i could and im truly saddened that barack wasnt elected
8122046 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8122047 what would you do if you received 50 messages or more per week from different senders offering products or services you do not want
8122048 failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning it takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach
8122049 a cluster of cities on the mississippi river my parents live in illinois but being on the border with iowa my father was able to travel around iowa during the lead up to the caucus there with his
8122050 you know a while back i met a young man named seamus in a vfw hall in east moline illinois
8122051 i thought of the 900 men and women sons and daughters husbands and wives friends and neighbors who wont be returning to their own hometowns i thought of the families ive met who were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered but who still lacked long term health benefits because they were reservists when we send our young men and women into harms way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going to care for their families while theyre gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war secure the peace and earn the respect of the world
8122052 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8122053 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8122054 she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8122055 it was an unequivocal endorsement of barack obama from hillary clinton he couldnt have asked for more from her
8122056 all eyes were on her it was the biggest moment of the convention so far and could have been a make or break moment for mr obama
8122057 this was a tough one for hillary and i think she did a masterful job
8122058 i think it took a lot of courage strength and intelligence
8122059 we know there are people out there with vital information that can assist us in identifying the six youths who came to the tower block that day
8122060 it may be that they havent contacted us because they dont want to get involved or think other people are bound to come forward
8122061 i urge these people to contact us in the strictest confidence and talk over what you may have seen know or have heard no matter how insignificant you feel the information may be
8122062 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get in trouble
8122063 he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
8122064 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8122065 the strong man john mitchell and the secrets of watergate
8122066 sen obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8122067 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8122068 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8122069 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8122070 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8122071 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8122072 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8122073 we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8122081 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8122082 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area
8122083 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s

8122090 i think its filled with loopholes why dont you just simply say that you will not market to children this kind of r rated material that you will not market to children this kind of r rated material that you will not market it to children under seventeen period
8122091 id love to sit and watch movies every day and say which ones are suitable and which ones are not
8122092 our schedule for 2008 will be similar to our 2007 schedule but we are changing our north atlantic operations by moving to toronto in canada from baltimore washington we have expanded considerably over the past few years so the focus in 2008 is on making adjustments to our network we have a strong focus on serving our domestic icelandic market and visitors to iceland and we are fine tuning the icelandair network and our capacity in order to increase its profitability
8122093 this city has the potential to become a very popular destination for icelanders as its a thriving multicultural city it also offers possibilities for inbound tourism to iceland as toronto is the key canadian transportation hub for millions of people last year we started flying again to halifax so we have a strong focus on canada at the moment
8122094 we say goodbye to baltimore washington now after flying to the city for years unfortunately the route became less profitable recently following the departure of thousands of u s citizens from the u s military base in iceland
8122095 our network is based on a 24 hour rotation where our aircraft leave iceland for europe in the morning return in the afternoon then
8122096 next summer we are flying from iceland to 25 destinations in europe and north america with varying frequency to each destination we are constantly reviewing and fine tuning our schedule in order to offer the best possible service for our clients in iceland and our other destinations
8122097 the strength of our relationship with halifax and atlantic canada over the last decade has paved the way for this success
8122098 icelandair will initiate flights from toronto in spring 2008 to complement our halifax service
8122099 the canadian market plays a very important role in the growth of our route network
8122100 our expansion to toronto will open an array of opportunities for commercial and leisure travel between canadas most populated areas and iceland
8122101 and to our many destinations in scandinavia great britain and continental europe
8122102 this latest agreement under our blue sky policy marks another step towards greater choice and flexibility for canadian travelers while connecting them to the world
8122103 the shift in earnings continues with energy contributing 25 1 of the s amp p 500 s operating earnings during the second quarter up from 16 4 a year ago
8122104 conversely financials have now posted their third consecutive quarter of negative earnings after accounting for 28 4 of operating earnings this time last year
8122105 we are always looking for ways to improve the customer experience on icelandair com we introduced a new fare structure which provides greater flexibility and transparency to customers who can for example purchase one way fares at a lower discount rate and travel the return trip on our premium fare service sagaclass working with amadeus has enabled us to offer enhanced levels of service to our customers this award is a very welcome recognition of our efforts
8122106 to stay ahead in the competitive online travel market airlines need to continually improve their services for their customers icelandair has adopted the full amadeus e commerce solutions for their website since 1997 and this award is a recognition of our perfected usability and design based on advanced technology such as xhtml this award is a recognition of the strong and successful partnership between icelandair and amadeus and a continuing commitment to develop in line with customer needs
8122107 there were many entries in this category and the judges had a tough job picking one site that stood above the rest as the quality of all work was very high in the end though the overall design feel and functionality of the icelandair site won through the site enables a great and simple user experience whilst remaining stylish
8122108 this is award is a great achievement for icelandair and were extremely proud of our accomplishment the online channel is the backbone of our sales efforts and its important that we do an excellent job in that area the fact that were nominated alongside worldclass companies like orange tesco hp and nike shows how far weve advanced in this field
8122109 online marketing is a key strategy in our sales and marketing efforts we are therefore extremely pleased to have won this important award for a company like ours its important to utilize the highest value channels in our marketing and sales efforts the online channel allows us to effectively increase our marketing reach our new look site is easy to use and provides our customers with all they need to research plan and book their trip this award demonstrates our commitment to providing a full service to our customers and is a success we wish to build on with more innovations and developments in the near future
8122110 im elated with this result which is the best that icelandair has ever managed it shows clearly that the icelandic advertising and marketing industry has noticed the changes at icelandair im certain that no other icelandic company has ever managed to win so many accolades in the same year now the challenge will be how to do even better this year
8122111 whether it is disney world in florida or the tivoli in copenhagen these trips give families memories that are cherished the fund gives us at icelandair and our customers a chance to make a difference in these childrens lives it is important that the whole family is able to travel together and that all expenses are covered by the icelandair travel fund
8122112 icelandair is one of the largest companies in iceland and plays an important role in icelandic society birkir h lm is a powerful leader who knows icelandair inside out and has a variety of experiences of the operation of the company in iceland and abroad i trust him and his staff at icelandair to lead the company and develop it with the changes in our business environment there are immediate issues facing us in the form of higher fuel prices and consumer demand following economic uncertainties and a firm hand is needed at the controls of the airline
8122113 it is an honour to have the opportunity to lead icelandair i have worked for the company in a variety of jobs and countries and i know we have great staff which i look forward to work with the big task ahead is a profitable operation of icelandair in the challenging present environment that is an exciting project which i will enjoy to tackle with my colleagues
8122114 the internet check in facility will be very convenient for many passengers and shorten waiting times at the air terminal we have seen rapid growth in computer bookings and the internet check in service is a natural extension technical development of the new service began some time ago and we made a point of implementing it first in iceland as most of our passengers pass through the terminal here we will introduce internet check in services at our other destinations at a later date
8122115 this new partnership is a part of the continuing work to offer our saga club members improved service with new and exciting possibilities for using their points we are looking forward working with points com and are sure our members will welcome the additional service we can now provide
8122116 we are excited to offer icelandairs saga club members more ways to manage their award points
8122117 by giving members the opportunity to make the most out of their rewards we are helping to provide more value for saga club members and create increasingly loyal customers for icelandair
8122118 by providing a full service solution for our partners we are able to leverage our expertise developed through working with the worlds leading loyalty programs to the benefit of icelandair and saga club
8122119 icelandair looks forward to serving halifax and is enthusiastic about the future opportunities in canada
8122120 we are pleased with the vision the canadian government has set forth in its blue sky policy and firmly believe that the emphasis on increasing airline competition in canada will be beneficial to travel and tourism
8122121 we were the first scheduled carrier in europe to agree to purchase the b 787 from boeing at the time only 15 carriers had made an order so we were among the very first to order this new aircraft we have since watched this revolutionary aircraft become one of the most sought after planes in the history of civil aviation just based upon pre orders its exactly this demand that presents us with such a great opportunity icelandair group is involved in a number of business activities beyond our scheduled service we are also involved in charter and aircraft trading and leasing in all of these lines of business we see many opportunities for the b 787 dreamliner we aim to eventually utilize it in the icelandair route network however we have not decided exactly when we will do so we are also seeing some exciting opportunities appear in the trading and leasing side of things as the increased demand has raised the price since we signed our purchase agreement
8122122 with this agreement we looked ahead to the future today icelandair utilizes boeing 757 aircraft in its fleet that aircraft is a great fit for its current network the boeing 787 dreamliner is a revolutionary aircraft quickly becoming one of the most sought after aircrafts in civil aviation history this new aircraft bigger than our current planes and it offers a greater range with our current planes we can serve markets in europe and north america that account for 700 million people but with this new aircraft we can reach nearly every continent its not far fetched to say that weve increased our potentional market to 6 billion people with this new aircraft through our agreement with boeing we have opened up many options in the development of icelandair

8122130 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time

8122196 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments minutes of the aug 5 federal open market committee meeting said
8122197 there is a big split on the fomc no doubt about that said lyle gramley a former fed governor and senior economic adviser at stanford group co in washington
8122198 we know there is a severe credit crunch but it is difficult outside the housing market to pin down how much impact it is having on the economy
8122199 many participants noted that the financial system remained fragile with some expressing continued concern about the possibility of an adverse feedback loop where tighter credit conditions push the housing market even lower the minutes said
8122200 several other participants suggested that the risks to the financial system had receded
8122201 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative the minutes said

8122204 i think they are hell bent on having a pretend vote
8122205 all of that energy is now going to be channeled into making sure the democratic party does not inherit such incompetent leadership as we have had to endure this election season
8122206 i dont think you should be behind the party right now
8122207 keep standing in front of the pepsi center and saying this is a fraud and a fake and i am not going to be party to a party that is corrupt
8122208 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8122209 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate

8122214 they were testing the pantsuits earlier it was on drudge
8122215 there were four different pantsuits and they were holding them up to see which color went best against the backdrop and i had a feeling shed pick
8122216 i dont know her handlers i guess at least the attack necklace is gone
8122217 the necklace its a nice little one do you remember during the primaries when hillary kept appearing with those giant chunky necklaces that looked like they were attacking her neck shes got a shortish neck like me and you just cant wear
8122218 ha standing up for the invisible people how bout the unborn hillary theyre pretty invisible

8122224 i guess hillarys not the only one whos wishing for that
8122225 im going to go see what people are saying about the speech im pretty sure that will be much more interesting than the speech itself was
8122226 we are worse off than we were four years ago
8122227 these are the soul trying times our forebearers spoke of when the ease of complacency and self interest must give way this was true for those who went to lexington and concord it was true for those who lie buried at gettysburg it was true for those who built democracys arsenal to vanquish fascism
8122228 im afraid gustav could potentially cause an impact similar to hurricanes katrina and rita although i certainly do not wish such things
8122229 if we can get him 15 20 snaps in friday nights exhibition finale against san diego that would be good

8122231 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8122232 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8122233 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8122234 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8122235 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired

8122241 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female
8122242 and at that time there will be two men in one bed and one shall be taken and not the other
8122243 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female
8122244 thou shalt not use thy lower digestive tract as a sex organ i have given thee all the sex organs that thou dost need
8122245 if a man lies with a man as he lies with a woman the two commit an abomination before the lord
8122246 a man will leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and the two shall be made one flesh
8122247 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
8122248 it will be easier to push through legislation on the issues that hillary wants with as president

8122250 thanks but no thanks how the u s missed a chance to get bin laden
8122251 anyone who values her judgment and leadership needs to listen to what shes saying voting for mccain would be like throwing hillary under the bus since she has expressly stated that a mccain vote is antithetical to everything she stands for
8122252 and you wonder why we believe hillary is the best
8122253 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8122254 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8122255 so now even if obama loses no one can point a finger at her
8122256 she is right about the issues but we know we cannot trust obama on the issues
8122257 i love the new talking points the trolls got tonight they are telling us how great hillary is as if we dont already know and then saying how awful we are to her if we dont follow her advice to vote for obama

8122264 angela walked the young woman to her car in the parking garage she said nobody should be afraid

8122274 in 2000 the state had 1 021 000 manufacturing jobs
8122275 in 2007 it was down to 773 000 manufacturing jobs thats what the income loss is all about
8122276 youll have an uptick in unemployment associated with some continued job loss in ohio
8122277 were losing some additional high wage manufacturing jobs with the declines in the auto industry so its certainly safe to say that 2008 will see some declines in income

8122338 one can find volumes of anecdotal evidence on both sides and make the same claim you do anecdotes are single cherry picked scattered data points and are by themselves completely meaningless if you can show there have been more cold events than warm ones and that over an extended time period then you are beginning to talk science anything else is pure chatter over the fence in the backyard find a single scientist who does not agree with that the steady use of randomly selected anecdotes by this website does nothing to increase its integrity like it or not thats my view

8122377 i thought she was a class act she defended her campaign she did it all
8122378 that was her best speech ever and had the crowd in her hand im not shocked that she would do the minimum for obama because the clintons have always been about themselves there was no poetry in it then how could it be her best speech her speech was of somebody who is coming back i like that part this is somebody who is saying im a presence she tacked herself on to everything she said about obama he was almost an accessory to her but as i say what do you expect from the clintons
8122379 she showed herself to be shockingly good in marshaling her own strengths she looked really strong and there were probably some people in the audience wondering if perhaps they picked the wrong candidate

8122385 the state of the switch whether it is on or off is like a computer memory that can store a bit of 0 or 1 although real biological switches are quite complex and regulated in many ways we have shown the simplest possible ways in which switches could work
8122386 our exploration using system x is rather like how a tinkerer or a kid puts together things to see if they do something useful we took a lot of spare parts each spare part being one chemical reaction connected them together every which way and we found that a surprising number of these artificially constructed networks actually were switches
8122387 popular opinion used to be that there are a small number of ways in which switches can be realized by biology but we found thousands of switches in our search
8122388 this has important implications since it suggests how evolution might stumble upon a switch rather easily
8122389 but switching and memory are the most basic behaviors possible armed with our catalog of switches we can now proceed to investigate more interesting behaviors like complex information processing

8122392 i commend the california legislature and governor schwarzenegger for their willingness to place the highest priority on bringing a high speed train system to california
8122393 assemblymember cathleen galgianis tenaciousness and skill kept ab 3034 alive to the benefit of every californian and governor schwarzeneggers leadership has ensured that unprecedented economic safeguards will guide the construction of a vitally needed transportation alternative
8122394 the high speed rail bill will put californias economy on the fast track to economic recovery by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ensuring accountability and oversight of state transportation dollars
8122395 this november californians will now be able to vote on a high speed train system grounded in public private financing and guided by fiscal accountability with the guarantee of no new taxes to fund the system
8122396 the california high speed rail authority has worked diligently to present the voters with the best most responsible improvement to our antiquated transportation systems in california
8122397 this choice for voters is overdue and the governor recognizes that high speed trains offer a sound solution which is both economically and environmentally responsible
8122398 i look forward to a robust introduction of high speed rail to california voters who repeatedly voice their support for jobs clean air better movement of goods and commerce and environmentally responsible transportation alternatives to high gasoline prices and overcrowded airports thanks to bipartisan efforts in sacramento californias shine is a little more golden today lets put the 21st century golden spike in the ground on november 4

8122441 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins as i say the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this and there are those whove decided i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy but it is it is also true that god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions and we want abortions to be safe rare and reduce the number of abortions thats why we have this fight in congress over contraception my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think but that is not the case so we have to take you know we have to handle this as respectfully this is sacred ground we have to handle it very respectfully and not politicize it as it has been and im not saying rick warren did because i dont think he did but others will try to

8122514 when classes open august 25 in harrold school buildings will be safer than normal thanks to this decision
8122515 critics of the plan will argue about liability or suggest that the school could have hired a security officer or off duty policeman but we all know that such officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
8122516 gun control extremists despise this kind of common sense approach to the potential of school violence
8122517 but the time has come to challenge their head in the sand philosophy how many lives have been lost on public school and college campuses because of these insane victim disarmament measures how many students and teachers might be alive today if only lawmakers and school officials had acted as responsibly as the harrold administration
8122518 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defense if other security measures at the school fail
8122519 no doubt the school board and mr thweatt will suffer some slings and arrows but if this decision one day saves the life of even one child it will have been worthwhile

8122555 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8122556 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only

8122560 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8122561 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative
8122562 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them
8122563 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8122564 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
8122565 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country
8122566 we have them write a paper about why they want to be teachers
8122567 most of them will say i used to pretend i was a teacher when i was a little kid
8122568 teaching is a noble profession but it shouldnt require a vow of poverty salaries are a problem teachers make 20 000 a year less than other professionals with comparable education and salaries havent been keeping pace with inflation the cost of health insurance is driving teachers into other professions a lack of mentoring and support can make new teachers feel very isolated particularly when todays students have such complex needs
8122569 we look for what we call disposition the disposition to teach its not enough just to love kids you have to have more than that you have to have a lot of patience you have to have dedication to the profession you have to be able to get along well not just with children but with colleagues and you have to be an excellent communicator communication is key in education today because youre working with parents colleagues and administrators so we look for all of those skills
8122570 i come home and i may still have papers to grade and lesson plans to think about for the following day its hard to define when my school day is done and when my personal life begins
8122571 you can have maybe five hours of roughly 30 students and if you do even just two assignments a week thats 300 papers a week that you have to correct youre given a prep hour every day but theres just no way you can get it all done and thats just correcting planning creating tests and creating assignments too
8122572 we had one copy machine for a school of 2 000
8122573 if you run out i think i ran out in march i couldnt make any more copies unless i begged them off of other teachers
8122574 there are kids who really want to do well and want to be challenged and in the same class there are kids who could care less and are only there because they are required to be because they are under 16 its difficult to inspire those bottom level kids while keeping the top level kids challenged enough and you cant ignore the middle kids who are working hard but maybe are still struggling
8122575 what is most depressing is when i get a student who comes with so many issues that i feel ill equipped to deal with im not a social worker im not a psychiatrist
8122576 i wanted to get more into the individual aspects of working with students when youre teaching youre teaching a group of kids and that can be anywhere from 30 to 40 kids and you want to service everybody
8122577 some students have issues going on at home that theyre battling with and you can see the distraction in the classroom
8122578 we cant deal with a lot of the mental health issues because were so focused on getting students to graduate that we miss the social emotional pieces i thought that just by being here as a teacher for six years and then by being a counselor i would be able to change some of that but its bigger than me
8122579 as a teacher you cant really be involved in the larger picture the decision making
8122580 teaching candidates need to know what the work day is going to be like and that there are going to be frustrations and that theyre not going to be able to affect a lot of change
8122581 but i know how girls learn and i know that one of the key things that makes learning relevant for women and girls is having to do with anything that relates to people
8122582 salaries are low for teachers when compared to salaries for other professions and that lowers prestige and social value
8122583 i dont think you should go into it for the money but if teaching were somehow presented as a more lucrative career then maybe more men would go into it i wish society could shift their perception of what teachers do and how valuable they are
8122584 teachers stay because there is nothing more rewarding than helping children reach their potential its remarkable to see a child engage in learning and grow intellectually
8122585 you can go home feeling good about all the things you did with the thought that maybe you are the only person who has done something good for that child that day
8122586 the students ive worked with have been wonderful ive been fortunate to be able to work with students in difficult circumstances who would show up with big smiles on their faces happy to be at school
8122587 the unconvention is an umbrella that provides a non partisan response to the rnc
8122588 we are trying to provide something other than what we get will get at the rnc we need to get past the expected scripted conversation and look at what participatory politics mean this is a non traditional way of getting at the issues
8122589 its about forgetting the partisan posturing and celebrating the shared values of liberty freedom justice equality and free speech
8122590 is a testimonial to the impact of eight years of extreme judicial legislative and executive actions on the american democratic institution from the landmark bush vs gore decision in 2000 forward
8122591 it is dancing where dancing doesnt belong practiced in public and semi public places such as museums or downtown elevators
8122592 like an invigorating wayward wind this work of choreography unburdens everyday life
8122593 i really just had to whisper to a few friends that i wanted to do a poster show about peace and democracy and a tidal wave of creative talent showed up the real value of a poster is that it is a tangible beautiful ownable artifact of a hopeful progressive voice
8122594 we want to create a safe respectful and positive experience for both local artists and activists and anyone visiting the twin cities
8122595 too nicey nice and too non partisan good for the folks from the suburbs
8122596 what explains the dysfunction at the dark heart of our politics
8122597 into a brawling beer drinking buddy of the working man george w
8122598 on closer inspection the country we have inhabited for the last three decades seems more like a panorama of madness and delusion of sturdy patriots reciting the pledge while they resolutely strangle their own life chances of small farmers proudly voting themselves off the land of devoted family men carefully seeing to it that their children will never be able to afford college or proper health care of hardened blue collar workers in midwestern burgs cheering as they deliver up a landslide for a candidate whose policies will end their way of life
8122599 oh the country im so jealous youll love it itll be so great for your kids
8122600 damn i have loyal readers and i owe them something interesting to read
8122601 and i proudly accept the nomination of the democratic party for president of the united states
8122602 were putting you all back on the tit and thats where youll stay as long as i have anything to say about it
8122603 how could she do that to us is she signalling us not to vote for barack

8122608 having one door in the front and another one on the back alley isnt safe there needs to be a door on the side thats the main reason for the purchase of the house
8122609 tying up the 2800 vacant lot to assure that there would be parking
8122610 a theater use has long been the dream of the community but whats important is to get a positive use that will work financially
8122611 we need a plan in place to give us the legal authority to carry out certain development activities the reason were putting it in place right now is because we think were going to pursue purchase of the house hillcrest bought it because they thought it would be helpful to have it for the project we are negotiating that the sale with them right now
8122612 we believe that this investigation of the irs is completely unfounded and politically motivated
8122613 there is a very clear effort national in scale to discredit defame and intimidate ministries and preachers of what has come to be called the
8122614 those behind these attacks we will for the moment only identify as enemies of the gospel often politically motivated they are fearful not only of the moral imperative communicated by these ministries but the growing wealth and influence of those constituencies in the natural world money is power and influence so a wealthy church individually and collectively is without question going to gain increasing visibility and influence in its city state and nation the opponents of christian ideology rightly understand that to limit our influence they must limit our growing wealth and to accomplish this goal they must undermine and corrupt the commitment of the donor base
8122615 the media allegations mean little or nothing if you keep the larger context in mind our individual level of wealth according to god eph 3 20 can potentially exceed what we can even ask or think limited only by the power of faith that works in us
8122616 i refuse to ever be embarrassed or apologetic for the level of gods blessing upon my life and believe every day that my preaching will have the same effect upon your life
8122617 in 2000 the state had 1 021 000 manufacturing jobs
8122618 in 2007 it was down to 773 000 manufacturing jobs thats what the income loss is all about
8122619 youll have an uptick in unemployment associated with some continued job loss in ohio
8122620 were losing some additional high wage manufacturing jobs with the declines in the auto industry so its certainly safe to say that 2008 will see some declines in income
8122621 theres great respect for the rooney family in the national football league and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the steelers continue to be operated by the rooneys and the way theyve been operated
8122622 we had a good dialogue good communication about the issues at hand and i think we have a better understanding of where things are
8122623 100 things cowboys fans should know and do before they die
8122624 ms miers testimony may help congress finally determine what remedial legislative steps if any should be taken in response to the forced resignations
8122625 has supplied no justification and the court cannot fathom one for its failure to turn over non privileged documents to the committee
8122626 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation
8122627 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8122628 ambitious little romancer trying to make the most of his short life limited physique and boundless imagination
8122629 well have a special look to the team with a lot of skill and creativity on the field
8122630 he coaches to encourage that creativity and plays a beautiful version of the field
8122631 hell be completely in charge of player development the recruiting of players and youth development hell have full reins from the beginning
8122632 my guess is hell bring in some pretty good players from brazil cooper said
8122633 establish a new style of american soccer that will be more exciting to both play and watch with the true athleticism of the u s players and the creativity and excitement of the brazilian style making it a very entertaining style of soccer
8122634 we look forward to hearing from them by the end of the year
8122635 it boosted everything because it let me know anything is possible
8122636 that game took me over the top with confidence at that time i felt nothing i could do would take me back to where i was
8122637 what coach zook has really tried to instill in me is to have the mind set that this is my team
8122638 its a transition that slowly happens in the spring i became more outspoken and more demanding of the offense when you do that people tell you its your team
8122639 we kept a lot of pressure off him the last two years i told him in july its time for you to take it over its the same blueprint we used with chris leak at florida the first year he struggled his sophomore year had some trying times and the third and last years he was pretty good and led the sec in every offensive category i see juice doing the same thing
8122640 now that hes gone we have to put the ball up the biggest thing i struggled with is accuracy the way to correct it is continuing to throw and to have a clear idea what to do with the ball instead of just guessing
8122641 felt like he had the weight of chicago on his back
8122642 the first half of last year if something happened hed let it affect the next play and the next
8122643 now hes mature enough to know there are going to be bad plays
8122644 he texts me when he has problems and i text him were like best friends now we never try to make it a competition
8122645 the only advantage we have is we train over the track other than that we didnt have an advantage
8122646 it was just our lucky day thats why its horse racing sometimes youre lucky and sometimes you arent if you look at the competition here we didnt have any business being in there
8122647 we thought she was pretty honest we needed a break in this race because it was a really tough field and she ran her race
8122648 no matter who you play youre concerned about first games he said tuesday after practice
8122649 the first game with your new team you dont want to do things to beat yourself he said
8122650 you dont want to have a lot of turnovers you want to have a kicking game thats very sound you dont want mental errors you dont want penalties all those things that supposedly happen in first games if we allow those things to happen were not going to have a chance
8122651 that being said were in the same boat everyone in the country is the same way nobody has an advantage so the teams that can mature the teams that can do it best those are the teams that will have the most success
8122652 ive practiced the last couple days at full go he said
8122653 its still a little bit swollen but its feeling good theyll just tape it up a little and put a pad on it its really nothing
8122654 there was no trash talk we wished each other good luck and told each other to stay healthy
8122655 if he is its going to be better competition maclin said
8122656 i told him i was the starting left tackle and he told me to keep it up and keep the spot to keep working hard fisher said
8122657 my dad had told me hed come to the first game that i start the next day he bought a plane ticket
8122658 going against the first team defense every day in practice helped me understand the speed i had to play at he said
8122659 ive been going against the no 1 defense for a while now theyre good
8122660 its remarkable actually whats hes accomplished thus far but hes not definitely out
8122661 if he doesnt play this week its very likely the next couple of weeks he will play
8122662 we all dont know the answer so why do we have to put an answer out there
8122663 were going to take it day by day if it happens sooner than later then great if its later then were not wrong
8122664 nothing hurt but it wasnt where it needed to be
8122665 we just want to make sure everything is right before i go out there to compete
8122666 its going to be a test were going to bump up the intensity on the mound depending on how i feel
8122667 the big thing is if my shoulder feels strong im going to work it if i go out there and my shoulder doesnt feel strong im not going to push it
8122668 how each day goes dictates how the next day goes it could be favorable it could take time
8122669 hes still got a ways to go before he gets out there again
8122670 injuries are injuries but you cant reward somebody because of it
8122671 its very difficult to promote somebody who hasnt played in a month
8122672 still we believe its been a very valuable year for him
8122673 el nico responsable de todo lo que pase aqu soy yo porque no puedo decir que ning n subalterno m o est haciendo cosas mal hechas si est bajo mi direcci n y mi responsabilidad para bien o para mal lo bueno o lo malo que pase aqu yo soy el culpable
8122674 kids would come up and maybe not recognize you but theyd ask who you are
8122675 once you told them your name theyd get all excited thats where you kind of feel good when the kids are excited to see you
8122676 it was a quiet 43 goals in this league and i dont know why
8122677 if he scored 43 in new york or toronto it might be a different story i just dont know if people appreciate his skill level
8122678 but like last season im not concentrating on that im concentrating on working hard on going to the net and shooting the puck and the goals will come im not going to sit there and say ive got to score this many goals no specific number but try and score every game
8122679 everyone starts back at zero and its about getting focused and getting back to where you were last year
8122680 you want to try and get in the same habits you had going into last season its just simple stuff like dont get lazy out there get to the net when we start playing games you want to make sure you have good habits on the ice and youre not doing things that youre not going to do in a game
8122681 i missed the net a lot and they dont count those shots
8122682 i was trying to pick corners too much a guy like ovechkin hell have 300 shots which tells you just shoot the puck and theyll go in whereas me id miss the net a lot if i cut that down maybe the percentage might not be as high but the goals will be which is what counts
8122683 hes going to be checked and hell play against other teams top defensemen but theres no fear with brad boyes
8122684 he always finds a way to get scoring chances and his hands are so gifted
8122685 if guys pay more attention to you thats a testament to you its a way to raise your level last year our line was doing well and wed got more attention im not going to be too surprised by that
8122686 todas y todos trabajamos derechos laborales para todos y todas
8122687 si hay trabajadores migrantes tambi n entran dentro de la poblaci n meta sin importar su estatus legal
8122688 el derecho laboral como los derechos humanos no implican si eres legal o no en un pa s si tienes o no tienes documentos son parte de los derechos humanos
8122689 esperamos que rusia cumpla sus compromisos internacionales y recapacite sobre esta decisi n irresponsable
8122690 ive had a few people who said that even a couple plays before where the guy kind of went low on me everybody started going back to the knee questions quite honestly when im out there playing i dont even think about all that
8122691 its like getting back on a horse you just get back out there its the game of football you cant worry about that stuff
8122692 this gives him a chance in a game to go out and find his rhythm
8122693 so hes not going in the season cold without reps if we ever called upon him
8122694 you cant assume that just because hes a vet that knows the system that he can just go out there and turn it on although i would bet on him more than a lot of guys
8122695 ive been with trent for five years in game like situations and hes been to a couple of pro bowls
8122696 thats why i keep coming back ive told all three of them scott al and terry ill take whatever playing time you want to give me and however that works out im comfortable with it
8122697 i know what i was brought here for and ive made that very clear to bulger
8122698 scotts made that very clear to him im here as an insurance policy a support system for him and the team and to be ready if they need me so i think we all kind of know our role
8122699 i still feel like i can make every throw i still feel like im mobile enough to buy time in the pocket im not going to sit here and say i can outrun many guys any more that all changed in 99
8122700 since i arrived on campus andy has been a great leader for this program on the field in the locker room in the classroom and done everything we ask of all student athletes
8122701 i saw the doctors with patients saw them do tests on them
8122702 they walked me through how to think about a diagnosis
8122703 with the course load as a pre med you have 17 18 credits of upper level science in the fall
8122704 youre studying for tests writing biology papers going to chemistry labs the friday before games
8122705 he loves to watch film hes all youd want hes got a good arm his two best games last season were our biggest games with north central he threw for 268 yards in a road win over a team ranked no 14 and case western he threw for 250 yards in a 35 27 loss to the no 21 team
8122706 were no longer the romans sitting on our side of the river were the germans on the other side saying we want what you have
8122707 we feel going into this year we have the necessary know how to take down good teams
8122708 we have a lot of good young talent its inexperienced talent but we have a lot of players who have capability
8122709 thats 60 yards a game that we changed field position
8122710 esta agua subi por la tierra que est n tirando ah abajo y el agua subi que nunca hab a subido por aqu
8122711 a la caasd que venga que yo necesito mi apartamento
8122712 yo tengo dos ni os y los tuve que sacar en la madrugada para que no se ahogaran
8122713 a m se me fue el televisor la estufa y el tanque de gas yo tuve que sacar las dos ni as huyendo y cuando las saqu se me fue todo ahora yo no tengo donde vivir porque se me fue todo todo
8122714 las ltimas 48 horas fueron de intranquilidad no pudimos dormir anoche ten amos miedo de que el r o nos arrastrara
8122715 comenzamos a mudarnos a casa de familiares y el gobierno vuelve a hacernos la misma promesa que nos llevar n a un lugar m s seguro y nos construir n apartamentos
8122716 el gobierno ha hecho poco por nosotros y estamos a la espera de que nos desalojen y nos consigan un solarcito por ah bien lejos de aqu para construir nuestra casita
8122717 the biggest difference between the professional and amateurs is that in amateurs bouts it is quantity of punches that counts whereas in the professional rank it is the effectiveness of the punches
8122718 i have found that former wrestlers make good boxers they have the mentality and discipline to do the training since they had to do it as wrestlers
8122719 i have lost many of my fighters to the mixed martial arts especially those with wrestling background they learn the basic of boxing and then move on
8122720 when i was starting boxing you had big stars like sugar ray leonard coming out of the olympics and they become professional stars there is nothing special about being in the olympics today and the stars arent coming out of the olympics
8122721 with the lost of the olympics as a special draw there is less reason to become an amateur
8122722 in professional it is not about how many punches you throw but what the effectiveness
8122723 it is not just about accuracy but the effect of the punch upon the opponents a jab doesnt carry the same weight as a well placed hook especially if the jab or jabs dont hurt the opponent
8122724 the first two years it was hard to look while they fight
8122725 but my daughters have learned to be good on defense so i dont worry as much
8122726 i did not see any videos of her to prepare for this fight
8122727 i couldnt let katy steal the show so i had to follow up with my own first round knockout
8122728 it was already mission impossible before and now it will be even more difficult
8122729 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8122730 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8122731 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8122732 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8122733 now the west cant look away anymore and georgias point of view is becoming difficult to ignore its way too early to make long term predictions but it could positively influence nato and the eu towards georgia
8122734 it was a small good responsible step but not anything that will measurably address this crisis said gelber
8122735 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8122736 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8122737 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8122738 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8122739 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8122740 for me as a mother who had a daughter on the other side of the world the best therapy for me was to step in and work harder here hoping that another volunteers doing the same in china where she was
8122741 i was able to watch peoples perceptions of america change post 9 11 people were so much more welcoming before moving into iraq than were following that
8122742 a couple times i was a republican to vote for the lesser of two evils in the primaries
8122743 working with a lot of the kids i worked with and their families thats whats gotten me not interested in politics to begin with but definitely re interested in some of the issues were facing today in terms of health care
8122744 theres no question in order to make this a better country all citizens must be involved and get involved
8122745 i was worried for a moment they kept moving the caucuses up and i was afraid i wasnt going to be able to caucus but luckily i turned 18 right before the february fifth caucus so i was able to do that
8122746 i support the democratic party i am a democrat but my principals come first
8122747 there are several things were accomplishing this week at the convention
8122748 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain
8122749 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
8122750 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8122751 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8122752 theres a lot of animus there because it was so close
8122753 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of 5 8ber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8122754 but those things only happen if shes seen as doing the right thing now
8122755 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8122756 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8122757 doesnt need four more years of the last eight years
8122758 speaking at the republican national convention is definitely something new for farm rescue
8122759 por la ma ana le a en los diarios el informe del banco central de espa a acerca de la situaci n de la argentina donde este banco desaconsejaba la inversi n en nuestro pa s adem s de no haber pronosticado su propia situaci n como pa s cuando uno mira el informe del mismo banco central de espa a sobre la argentina en enero del 2001 y en abril de 2001 advierte claramente que en realidad el an lisis y las predicciones en econom a no son su fuerte
8122760 en enero de 2001 se public el informe trimestral unos 9 10 meses antes de la peor crisis que haya tendido nuestro pa s financiera econ mica moral e institucional y social qu dec a el banco central de espa a
8122761 m s tarde m s cerca del incendio en abril de 2001 dec a en otro informe en cuanto a la argentina ha de destacarse que despu s de un per odo de turbulencias pol ticas el gobierno ha logrado la aprobaci n de un ambicioso plan que persigue un cu druple objetivo reactivar la econom a cumplir los compromisos fiscales ligados a la ayuda del fmi equilibrar el saldo exterior y recuperar la confianza de inversores y prestamistas internacionales textual subray la mandataria abril del 2001 a meses del mayor incendio que recuerde nuestra sociedad de la mayor tragedia porque adem s como termin fue una verdadera tragedia lo cual revela dos cosas o que bien no hacen an lisis demasiado acertados o hacen son an lisis absolutamente interesados
8122762 porque ah est bamos planteando la operaci n del megacanje en
8122763 realmente esto que hoy vemos publicado habla de la falta de seriedad y fundamentalmente de la irresponsabilidad con que se abordan temas que muchas veces deciden inversiones y en definitiva la vida de los argentinos y de todos los habitantes del mundo que parecemos estar sometidos a estos opin logos que resultan ser traders en el mundo de colocaci n de bonos y que toda la vida pasa por la colocaci n de un bono a tal o cual tasa
8122764 me parece triste que estas cosas sucedan pero suceden en el mundo contempor neo debemos abordarlas con conocimiento de c mo se manejan y con esencialmente con mucha responsabilidad en la difusi n de las informaciones
8122765 pa ses con interdependencia media o alta y riesgo elevado o muy elevado

8122921 i keep thinking that if he were the nominee mccain would be fifteen points behind

8122930 whoever denies me before men i also will deny before my father who is in heaven
8122931 no one knows the father except the son and anyone whom the son chooses to reveal him
8122932 thus it is written that the christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations

8122957 the party of military responsibility has taken us into a war with a country that did not attack us
8122958 the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts
8122959 a public line that we are not involved in the politics
8122960 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable

8123004 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8123005 they called it a home run at first so i didnt think they were going to change it but hey if those are the rules those are the rules you play by
8123006 from my seat i thought it wasnt at first but after i went out and argued with him and talked with him a little while he said he definitely saw it but i definitely think we still need replay
8123007 hes beaten me so many times i felt good against him all night
8123008 even if youre having an off year youre going to sprinkle a few in here and there we got one so at least we get off the schneid for a season
8123009 his command was good his breaking ball was good he was attacking the bottom of the strike zone
8123010 one doesnt know what to do for the best i mean i have been having a look at it iwould have thought if new zealand opened its doors up and got rid of the quarantine problem maybe we wouldnt retire him but thats not going to happen
8123011 all you have inaustralia is the miracle mile and you have to hang around a long time for it so i really dont know but after friday night we will come up with something
8123012 its probably my best chance to win a miracle mile but i would have to give up abreeding season or just about anyway i am 71 years old and i would like to see somelittle pocket watchs running around the country very soon
8123013 this has been the race for him all season i guess after this race we have to make somedecisions its not one i want to make but i am going to have to make it at some stage
8123014 there has been plenty of interest in lombo pocket watch as a stallion and lombardobelieves that breeders in the country are now ready to give australian horses a chance toprove themselves in the breeding barn
8123015 people dont give the aussie horses a go at stud but i think they are ready to do that the yanks cant beat our horses i dont care what they say they havent brought one out here that could so nothing is going to change
8123016 people say the quality of the ones that come here arent the good ones but i think that is a bunch of nonsense
8123017 the breeding industry in australia is interested to see how much the service fee will be when lombo pocket watch does go to stud however lombardo is confident that he will be affordable to all of the interested parties
8123018 we thought about 3000 that question is being asked a lot at the moment but we thought 3000 is very fair
8123019 it would be fun to send lombo pocket watch over there to the states but you cant do everything you have to have a trainer to go over there and you lose a lot of time thereis no way i would ever send him over there by himself

8123027 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8123028 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8123029 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8123030 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8123031 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped

8123070 the solution ultimately is that were going to go to a level of co2 emissions that maybe we had in the year 2000 so were not necessarily going to stop that but more and more and more were going to be bringing on line other sources of energy

8123125 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8123126 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8123127 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8123130 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are

8123147 contrary to some opinions only one per cent thought muslim men were under achievers

8123149 i wasnt able to talk to danieal but were going to connect later
8123150 getting released was more emotional for my wife than me
8123151 she was a little upset that they said i was a part of the program then they released me this late in the process when it could have been done a while ago that would have made things easier for my family
8123152 he hasnt picked up everything as quickly as you would like but no nickel ever has
8123153 nickel is a hard position to play ive never seen a guy who just goes over there right away within one year and plays it the way he will eventually play it
8123154 the most difficult thing has been just trying to make the transition and picking up on all the techniques
8123155 playing cover 2 cover 3 everybody can play man to man but its those other coverages
8123156 the motion shifts back and forth understanding your a lot of stuff that goes into the nickel in the process of one down
8123157 moving back and forth could negatively affect someone but it hasnt me
8123158 doing it during a game yeah that would be tough but they left me at safety toward the end of the season and that helped me iron out some of my weaknesses
8123159 certainly all ive ever known is to be out there and take as many repetitions as i could with these guys
8123160 he has been doing it forever since he was 6 years old in his yard
8123161 it shouldnt be hard it would be different if he were a second year third year fourth year guy
8123162 ive been doing that throughout training camp you put a lot of emphasis on the opener
8123163 he knows all these guys he has played with them but he hasnt been out there with him since the off season program
8123164 its different when youre just running on a track or treadmill to going out there starting stopping making cuts dropping back avoiding people
8123165 i dont know if the option and the sprint out will be as featured as it has been in years past
8123166 i guess you have to sacrifice something well probably stick to a little more drop back
8123167 i know whats being said but i just have to focus on what i can do
8123168 i cant let those kind of outside factors bother me
8123169 at this level especially being a younger player any injury is going to hold you back a little bit because of the speed of the game
8123170 as far as how big the game is going to be for me its going to be big because im going to get a lot of playing time
8123171 its a big game to show how ive progressed through the off season i have to show them that i can make some plays so far i havent made a lot of plays
8123172 i feel being a second rounder helps me because they know the potential that i have
8123173 to watch them rehab and see what they actually have gone through and what theyve done just for an every day life is so appreciated
8123174 there was a guy over there who actually delayed having surgery so he could meet us you hear stories like that that nearly blow you away
8123175 we just hang out with baseball players and certainly its an honor to be with hall of famers like thome and ken griffey but were still able to have camaraderie with them in a workplace environment
8123176 looks like a guy who belongs out there on the football field now a year ago you couldnt say that
8123177 if there are positives its that youll know exactly where your program is and the things you have to work on and our own practices have been a little more spirited
8123178 i was watching him run monday and he was at a full speed sprint
8123179 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
8123180 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave

8123184 by providing a fully integrated system platform the extended spartan 3a family delivers lower component counts less expensive printed circuit boards higher reliability reduced testing costs and higher yields to customers in cost sensitive applications
8123185 to meet their challenging cost goals customers in high volume markets such as consumer have asked us for platforms that enable fast time to market with low cost capabilities and xilinx has delivered
8123186 over the next few years its going to be important to draw people into the county
8123187 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8123188 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
8123189 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law

8123191 the fund in leos memory still exists and basically launched the foundation in the student aid business which has grown tremendously over the years
8123192 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8123193 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8123194 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8123195 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8123196 going to the nationals would be an amazing experience and its great that we have the opportunity to do that
8123197 when we are recruiting or playing against our competitors or are in the community this will mark us as oh yeah thats salem college athletics
8123198 small private colleges have become very competitive so when students come on campus even if they are not student athletes they are going to look at your athletics department
8123199 the only way to move forward was to integrate athletics into the college he said
8123200 a student who wants to be division iii wants to know that ultimately she could be a national champion
8123201 this year the historic high water mark of 193 000 hectares of opium cultivated in 2007 has dropped by 19 percent to 157 000 hectares
8123202 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high we are particularly concerned by the deterioration in security conditions in the south where the insurgency dominates
8123203 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8123204 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8123205 its encouraging to see the benefit of lower gas prices helping consumers a bit
8123206 this initiative will provide seamless application integration using zigbee or homeplug devices providing the flexibility utilities need when implementing ami and smart metering programs
8123207 mainstream market adoption of a common technology accelerates our ability to empower our customers to manage their energy usage
8123208 the integration of a common application layer across these technologies will allow a common certification process which is critical for plug and play interoperability
8123209 without such integration it will not be possible to scale energy efficiency applications and services
8123210 zigbee smart energy was developed by utility companies product manufacturers and technology suppliers so it makes perfect sense to leverage that collaboration
8123211 expediting the rollout of energy management and efficiency programs that help everyone better manage their energy use is our common goal and the zigbee alliance is proud to play a key role in this process
8123212 with more than 20 million homeplug enabled products in use on six continents homeplug technology is the leading global standard for power line networks
8123213 as utilities and access providers aggressively deploy homeplug technology in applications around the world for electric grid management automatic meter reading applications and demand response bpl and command and control applications continue to be a driving force for the alliance
8123214 is a big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
8123215 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
8123216 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
8123217 you can offer lower rates you can offer further incentives
8123218 but if a home buyer is going to have trouble coming up with a down payment thats difficult to offset
8123219 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8123220 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8123221 at this point there is overwhelming support for overriding the veto
8123222 this legislation as written will jeopardize safety on our highways
8123223 its a desperate attempt by the minister and this government to avoid scrutiny of helen clarks decision to keep winston peters on as minister of foreign affairs
8123224 i am looking forward to the time we have a prime minister who puts the country first that actually stands up for some principles that actually sets some standards for ministers and that ministers arent allowed to just tell any old pork pie that they like
8123225 he mr broad has no proposals to introduce any changes to the current situation immediately in fact all he is saying is i am going to seek mps opinions
8123226 people should pick chocolate the same way they buy wine and food by flavor
8123227 eventually i started fashioning my own equipment and began churning out some fine quality chocolate
8123228 it is extremely hard work and takes a lot of time but boy is it beautiful when you get right
8123229 chocolate is an affordable indulgence no matter how difficult economic times get well always want to treat ourselves
8123230 now you can go to kansas city and find a good chocolate maker who rivals the quality and craftsmanship of that you would find in europe
8123231 people love chocolate especially in hard times when they want to be comforted
8123232 members behaviour in the chamber is covered by standing orders and speakers rulings
8123233 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8123234 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8123235 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8123236 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8123237 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8123238 i didnt like it but i just thought that if i kept on going it would stop
8123239 when he said no that kind of hurt because i felt in that situation that i was just being used for sex
8123240 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8123241 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8123242 its kind of an experiment to see how that works
8123243 we will actually evaluate that at the end of the year if it works well we wont buy textbooks next year
8123244 i actually think the opportunity to not carry that big old book back and forth and access the book online is interesting
8123245 weve had no one indicate that they want to go back to the old textbooks but that is an option
8123246 as consumers look to stay connected and entertained regardless of where they are and what device they are using the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv thanks to a new generation of internet connected ce devices
8123247 as intel delivers its first ia soc with leading edge performance and internet compatibility for consumer electronics devices we are providing a powerful and flexible technology foundation upon which the industry can quickly innovate upon this technology foundation will help the high tech industry bring devices to market faster as well as encourage new designs and inspire new services such as connecting the tv to the internet
8123248 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8123249 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8123250 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8123251 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8123252 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8123253 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8123254 at this stage he is refusing to cooperate with the israeli police and we cannot legally force him to do so
8123255 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8123256 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8123257 theres a lot of animus there because it was so close
8123258 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of ber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8123259 but those things only happen if shes seen as doing the right thing now
8123260 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8123261 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8123262 you have in the two people running for president interestingly two people who represent very different views of how to solve the challenges we face
8123263 on one side with barack obama you have an individual who i believe is a very charming and charismatic celebrity and senator a nominee for the democratic position to become president
8123264 as you stand back and look at joe biden you see someone who has spent 30 years dealing with foreign policy but has usually been wrong
8123265 despite the fact that we differed on issues in every debate i pointed out my respect for him
8123266 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8123267 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8123268 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8123269 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8123270 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8123271 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8123272 sit and worry about what will happen three years from now if i do that or this
8123273 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8123274 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8123275 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8123276 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8123277 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8123278 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8123279 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8123280 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8123281 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver i understand some folks may not like that but you know im a job applicant
8123282 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8123283 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8123284 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8123285 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8123286 but mr zardari has shown himself unwilling to do that
8123287 what kind of politics is he playing that kind of inconsistency will be very bad for pakistan
8123288 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8123289 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8123290 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8123291 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8123292 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8123293 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability
8123294 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
8123295 the gains in the north and east show that counternarcotics efforts can succeed
8123296 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
8123297 a high alert has been sounded in jammu due to the infiltration by three terrorists from across the international border
8123298 this is a serious situation the intruders sneaked into the indian side under the cover of fire which was most probably provided by the pakistani rangers

8123308 weve taken our very successful pcie reference design kit and performed the necessary design optimizations qualifications and certifications including rohs fcc and ce resulting in an entire series of dvr add in cards for oems and system integrators
8123309 compressing streams at their full resolution and frame rate retains all the detail within a scene with complete fluidity of motion current solutions compromise on frame rates and resolutions because they lack processing capability
8123310 the vrc6000 series cards capture the complete video transmitted by todays cctv cameras
8123311 the armed forces of the philippines sadly confirms reports that one of its c 130 planes crashed in waters between davao and samal island
8123312 we are conducting investigations to determine the cause of the incident
8123313 the air force has been in the limelight because of our air strikes on milf lawless groups
8123314 but in the game the clock was stopped while the arbiter was called to the table in the discussion between player and arbiter jaxs opponent actually took the

8123318 what value do you want to extract from your home

8123320 and caps fans can still buy those tickets with savings season ticket holders get them at their usual rate and fans can buy mini plans as small as six games that include substantial savings
8123321 i dont fucking exist because he doesnt own a fucking car you junk mailing jackass
8123322 its not a matter of moving beyond the olympics that will always be part of our fabric this is about reinforcing the brand that we have spent a considerable amount of effort time and money on in the last three years
8123323 this is our welcome mat to the person driving into the state they may not be staying in the state but theyll have a far richer welcome with these signs than we had before
8123324 from the competitive wisconsin report wisconsin has moved further away from the national average in per capita income number of new jobs created and the number of new private businesses according to the states annual benchmarks
8123325 the wisconsin technology council is promoting invest wisconsin the six pieces of which include tax relief regulatory reform and judicial reform
8123326 wileys opinion piece is not something an actual leader does on the way out the door
8123327 it is impossible as well to imagine that any of northeast wisconsins six private college presidents would similarly snipe at those whose taxes and contributions pay the bills on the way to their retirements
8123328 wileys piece also demonstrated the divide between my hometown the peoples republic of madison and the rest of wisconsin if there is one negative and its not the only one that stands out about madison in the 20 years since i left it is the insufferable sense of conceit elitism and self importance that oozes like bad cologne out of madisons institutions including the uw and its news media
8123329 the wisconsin idea held that the boundaries of the university of wisconsin that is to say the world class university in madison and the boundaries of the state were the same
8123330 none of this is to say that there isnt an important role for the uw non madisons in this state and for that matter the states private colleges in economic development
8123331 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
8123332 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
8123333 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
8123334 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
8123335 i hope the bank of england are doing more than just crossing their collective fingers
8123336 the bank of england must be prepared to act as lender of last resort we cannot afford to let a major bank collapse
8123337 we certainly believe that the impact of the credit crunch is going to take some time to sort out and it may be prolonged
8123338 but if the right measures can be taken by the government and the monetary policy committee they can avoid a major recession
8123339 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8123340 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8123341 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8123342 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
8123343 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8123344 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8123345 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8123346 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8123347 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8123348 the construction crews have been very very busy they recognize we are working against the clock school starts on tuesday and students will be here staff came this week so they have been working 10 and 12 hour days to make sure that the school is safe enough for public access and for student access we appreciate all that they have done
8123349 right now they have one more modular to bring in and they have two of the modulars that are on site and will be finished within a few days the third one will be finished within a week and ready for occupancy our new building the science and the library we are just waiting for final occupancy permission by the end of this week in the meantime we have lot of plan bs
8123350 we are looking forward to the challenges we think that it has drawn us all closer together its really given the glide community a chance to once again pull together and show everyone what a great place and a great school that we have

8123355 wake up call we have all over the country crumbling infrastructure
8123356 we have more fun learning when we go more in depth with a topic
8123357 i dont know if its dumbing down the level of these courses they should be reserved for students who want to do advanced work
8123358 sols are almost counter to what were trying to accomplish
8123359 its made the teachers fearful of doing the things theyd like to do in their classroom
8123360 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8123361 they were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8123362 with all other diabetes medications we know there has been pancreatitis and some of those people have died
8123363 capital management and portfolio initiatives transacted over the last few years ensured the group is in a strong position to continue to deliver growth
8123364 tonight we need to really remember what a presidential election is really about senator clinton said
8123365 when polls have closed and the ads are finally off the air it comes down to you the american people your lives and your childrens futures
8123366 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8123367 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8123368 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8123369 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities of st paul and minneapolis for the republican party convention

8123372 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8123373 i know some will resist these changes he said today
8123374 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8123375 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8123376 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8123377 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8123378 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8123379 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8123380 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools

8123385 sorry dude dawkins hates christians and his whole point in evolution is scewered to that point get the point plus ive probably seen them how about explaining the coelacanth fish no one else will you really need to post text
8123386 im sorry i thought you new something of evolution in fact from that statement alone tells me youve never read darwins book diviation of the kinds or micro evolution works piss of bj with this but i dont care you have big dogs and little dogs their still dogs a pug cannot mate with a bull mastiff but there still dogs
8123387 for all there is no such thing as a simple celled organisim or for that mattter a simple cell i predict that now that we have soft dino tissue well soon find living single cell organisims from millions of years ago lol you guys are the ones that think we come from a rock
8123388 1 40 x 1070 different genetic codes to hit upon the universal genetic code found in nature yockey estimates the maximum time available for the code to originate as 6 3 x 1015 seconds put simply natural selection lacks adequate time to find the universal genetic code it would have to evaluate about 1054 codes per second 1 4 x 10 70 6 3 x 10 15 10 54
8123389 the laotian rock rat laonastes aenigmamus described last year by the wildlife conservation society scientists in laos is certainly new to science and a genetically distinct species while also representing the lone survivor of an ancient family
8123390 however it may not be that rare on a recent visit to a hunters market in laos wcs conservationist peter clyne found the rats to be quite common photographing several specimens
8123391 no finale can be specified at the start none would ever occur a second time in the same way because any pathway proceeds through thousands of improbable stages
8123392 it seems that as the tape of life has been replayed in separate islands there has been a remarkable amount of convergent evolution
8123393 why do we see organisms that are perfectly suited to their ecological niche
8123394 if it does turn out that cairnsian mutations are common we will face the challenge of trying to estimate how much adaptive variation in natural populations derives from random mutations and how much from selectively driven mutations
8123395 we should be cautious about rejecting the notion of directed mutations simply because it makes us more comfortable to do so
8123396 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve

8123485 it made no mistake where her heart and her mind and energy will be and that is about electing barack obama president
8123486 it was a reminder that this nations possibilities are more important than any one person or any one campaign
8123487 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8123488 i just thought she could not have done a better job of convincing her supporters that those who have gone to obama have done the right thing and that those who havent should feel comfortable
8123489 what a shame it is they cant both be president
8123490 i hope we never have to hear another word of whether hillary is doing her part

8123522 this week downtown denver has been turned into a police state we have mounted cossacks on horses with shields over their eyes we have flying squads hanging off suvs as they dash through the streets sirens wail as convoys race to their destinations we have black uniformed storm troopers marching our sidewalks in patrols of ten coveys of bicycles carrying officers with utility belts full of deadly devices slowly circle around us we have police on every corner and reinforcements with automatic weapons secreted in every possible location undoubtedly there are more and more heavily armed troops in denver this week than in baghdad
8123523 sometimes blacks had to guess how many jelly beans were in a jar

8123527 she certainly put on a performance tonight that looked real

8123533 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8123534 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8123535 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8123536 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8123537 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8123538 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8123539 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8123540 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8123541 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8123542 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8123543 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8123544 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8123545 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8123546 who are open to doing something on the production side
8123547 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8123548 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8123549 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8123550 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8123551 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8123552 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8123553 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8123554 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8123555 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8123556 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8123557 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8123558 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8123559 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8123560 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8123561 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8123562 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8123563 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8123564 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8123565 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8123566 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8123567 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8123568 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8123569 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8123570 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8123571 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8123572 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8123573 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8123574 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8123575 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8123576 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8123577 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8123578 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8123579 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8123580 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8123581 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8123582 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8123583 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8123584 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8123585 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8123586 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8123587 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8123588 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8123589 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8123590 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8123591 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8123592 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8123593 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8123594 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8123595 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8123624 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8123625 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8123626 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8123627 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8123628 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8123629 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8123630 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8123656 im honored to stand before you as gov bob caseys son
8123657 a leader who as lincoln said appeals to the better angels of our nature
8123658 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8123659 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is a testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who disagree with him
8123660 everywhere barack went people who may have been asking who this guy was ended up seeing what i saw everywhere we went the people of pennsylvania gave him the highest praise they give anyone hes one of us too
8123661 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8123662 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8123663 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan are the billions of dollars in tax breaks hes promised to energy companies
8123664 they ran up the debt gave huge subsidies to big oil companies and now theyre asking for four more years how about four more months
8123665 i think its best to let the historians debate it and move on and look to the future
8123666 its interesting even in the last six months ive heard facts that i didnt know before i think it was apart from what happened to him and the insult a missed opportunity to listen to a guy who really understood how people struggle
8123667 i think the party has changed in the sense that one of the first things john kerry said after the 04 race was weve got to reach out more to pro life democrats hillary clinton said that a lot and talked about that when she was campaigning
8123668 lets be candid i dont think were at the point where our party could nominate someone who is pro life maybe even at the vice presidential level
8123669 with mccain it would be particularly hard because of his own up and down im being charitable here up and down relationship with the right
8123670 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country
8123671 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8123672 john mccain is my friend and colleague but he still doesnt believe women deserve equal pay for equal work or the right to choose
8123673 he would turn the clock back and what we need from our president is forward movement and the kind of progress we would expect for the next generation of americans
8123674 i know a little bit about how the white house works and if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama well have someone who will answer that phone
8123675 no one has been more gracious and forthcoming and helpful to me
8123676 offering me advice and guidance not just this year but over her career she has offered our daughters a vision of who they can become
8123677 look i think there are people who are so committed its hard for them to let go
8123678 they have a dream and i understand that but in the long run it doesnt serve democrats well
8123679 i dont think theres really anything else obama can or should do
8123680 because im a woman i believe in change and hillary clinton barack obama and michelle are all part of that change time will heal things
8123681 she knows you get over it and you move on
8123682 it can damage their the clintons legacy if they dont get a grip pretty quick
8123683 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8123684 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8123685 he said some things that were inappropriate and you had people holding bills remarks against hillary i even wonder if obama didnt pick her as vice president because he knew hed have to deal with bill
8123686 i wouldnt say i am annoyed but i am concerned
8123687 i just thing we have to consider the party above any one person
8123688 this is just a media driven rift its not real and by the end of the week youll see that
8123689 it wasnt a split it was a crevice a grand canyon
8123690 look its very hard to run a tough campaign and forget about it immediately
8123691 what i find about mrs clinton though is that she has continuously said to her supporters that they have to get behind sen obama and i think in the end those supporters will listen to what she has to say
8123692 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america

8123717 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best
8123718 its important that as the web hosting industry moves forward we understand that internet users are seeking a customized personalized internet experience for both personal and professional reasons ultimately its about customer relationships providers and resellers need to work together to provide the support services and infrastructure that give users the best experience

8123722 its just a weird feeling its going to be something new but i have been in seattle my whole career
8123723 i was watching the trial between the city and sonics real close i knew the decision was supposed to come out on july 2 and they announced the settlement and i was kind of shocked from what everybody was saying the city was not going to accept a buyout at that point it was just shock
8123724 the front office has kept us informed on anything they know and the people of oklahoma city have been really great theyve been really helpful
8123725 we havent seen players but thats the way it is in the offseason even if we were in seattle i would still probably be the only one here
8123726 a lot of people just say they are sad to see us leave
8123727 they say a lot of nice things about me personally thats the toughest thing for me were a part of the nba we accept this but the fans are left with nothing so thats who i feel the worst for the diehard sonics fans who have been around for a long time

8123738 anytime you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8123739 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8123740 and therefore and only in those cases should we have replay
8123741 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play

8123750 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refueled to go to paris
8123751 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8123752 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8123753 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8123754 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8123755 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8123756 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8123757 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8123758 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8123759 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8123760 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8123761 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8123762 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8123763 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8123764 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8123765 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
8123766 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
8123767 so hillary what you need to do is get out there and comfort your supporters reassure obamas supporters gather in the undecideds say nothing that mcnasty can use against you or obama good luck with that and be gracious and composed throughout any questions
8123768 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8123769 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8123770 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8123771 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8123772 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8123773 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8123774 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8123775 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play
8123776 youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8123777 your interpretation is correct there are clearly some features and functionality that nintendo could add to the wii without changing the way the games are played as you say

8123807 if were split on it with our small little democracy well give the benefit of the doubt and look at the replay and if that can show without a doubt that im right or show without a doubt that im wrong then thats what we go by
8123808 im not going to let a manager or a coach or a player just try to get away with something either im going to believe my crew if my crew shows me without a doubt in their mind that they made the right call im sticking with it i wont even use instant replay
8123809 sometimes you cant tell thats not saying ballplayers can tell when that question does come up most of the time they cant tell either
8123810 its here its what were going to deal with and we can use it as another tool
8123811 maybe if we happen to make a mistake we can correct something and our goal as umpires always is to get it right and not affect the outcome of a game its another tool we can use to do that and if it helps us correct the mistake thats a great thing
8123812 when all the new stadiums were built to be fan friendly and you have places where fans can just reach over the outfield wall you started to have some controversy
8123813 you never had that before i think they really want this for the playoffs and the world series theres nothing wrong with having to reverse a call if a home run is initially called wrong
8123814 you dont want to change it to something totally wrong because the other manager put on such a great argument or his ballplayers did or the fans had a reaction from that section everything that weighs on an umpires mind i believe this here will definitely help
8123815 if major league baseball said every single call you guys make we go to the replay then i probably would have been a little insulted
8123816 but ive been in that position to where i see a home run i see it hit the foul pole or i see a fan definitely interfere or a fan not interfere i have seen it where its 100 percent in my mind sure
8123817 and then with the argument with the manager and the player well then all of a sudden i might have doubt then ill call my crew together then ill find out something different from my crew and then im like holy mackerel were human sometimes you pick up a spoon when you need a fork

8123852 we expect the population of russia to shrink by 32 million people to about 110 million that means russia will lose about a quarter of its population to sustain its economy russia increasingly will have to look elsewhere for workers some of them will be immigrant russians coming from the former soviet states what the russians call the near abroad but there arent enough of them to make up that population loss others will be chinese and non russians from the caucasus central asia and elsewhere potentially aggravating russias already uneasy racial and religious tensions

8123857 shameful for india within the international community it is a blot on indias image the international community might end up seeing us as a nation where the government is slow to act and police is ineffective
8123858 the indian church immediately condemned the murder of the guruji the church has never been a party to any violence the vendetta against christians is pure madness
8123859 our women religious have given their lives to empower the same people who are now assaulting them
8123860 our nuns have given dignity to these people through the social ministry of the church and today they are brutalised by this senseless mob this is diabolical
8123861 it was painful to see that the people we serve for whom we are doing good work can do such things we must never the less forgive and go on with the eyes focused on our mission
8123862 throughout the state especially in the district of kandhamal many families are without food shelter and in some cases even clothing last night many people were hiding in the forests out in the open as heavy rain poured out of the sky conditions for children and women are indescribable children cannot go to school and are traumatised by the violence women are exhausted by the destruction of their homes and families
8123863 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
8123864 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
8123865 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
8123866 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
8123867 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8123868 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8123869 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8123870 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8123871 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8123872 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8123873 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8123874 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8123875 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8123876 pantheas was something we needed during the rebuilding process but we were all aware of his lack of commitment and personal conflicts with a lot of what decius doom stands for
8123877 oh my god shine your light on us so that we may live
8123878 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8123879 do you really think you should do it like that
8123880 i recently reviewed your resume and would like to speak with you about opportunities with our company can you e mail me a copy of your resume

8123882 would you given a harvard graduate a position of ceo right after graduation no
8123883 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
8123884 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8123885 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8123886 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8123887 we had a very constructive 2 hour meeting today i think everyone now has an even better understanding of the issues which focus on the leagues gambling policy as it relates to ownership our 30 percent equity rule for principal owners and the rooney family issues there are also important league interests that are involved because the nfl owners are partners collectively in the nfl and our rules require that all ownership transfers be approved by three quarters of the owners so i thought it would make sense on that basis to have nfl owners involved in the meeting and i invited tom benson mike brown and jerry richardson to participate which they did today was another step in the process we will continue the dialogue and i am optimistic that we will bring it to a resolution in the near future
8123888 he has changed his slogan from socialism or death to a better world is possible appropiate for the more pacifistic revolulionaries of a new era
8123889 wir werden uns die beiden konzepte anschauen und sehen welches in unserem sinne ist

8123904 jagalah dirimu dari api neraka walaupun hanya dengan sebiji kurma
8123905 ya abal hasan amal yang paling utama di bulan ini adalah menjaga diri dari apa yang diharamkan allah

8123918 wow are they kidding if this isnt desperation i dont what is this wont play to independents who they must be targeting i assume the ones who will buy this already think hes an elite muslim arrogant snob
8123919 for those sweeties in this thread who might be feeling periodically blue that obama has 99 problems but a bitch aint one perhaps they should realize their claws are out and recall that obama telegraphed his male privilege and sexism plenty this primary
8123920 in a more perfect world clinton would be the presidential nominee
8123921 for those sweeties in this thread who might be feeling periodically blue that obama has 99 problems but a bitch aint one perhaps they should realize their claws are out and recall that obama telegraphed his male privilege and sexism plenty this primary

8123928 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
8123929 the most qualified candidate to lead our country as commander in chief
8123930 hahaha yeah ive seen some weird interps i knew and evangelical christian who assumed getting a computer virus meant satan had done it because how else would it happen well assholes who write computer viruses
8123931 hahaha thanks i cant guarantee thats what happened but id lay money thats what it was
8123932 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8123933 im ecstatic to be able to hold one of the preeminent social networking events in cincinnati on fountain square
8123934 if it is an action that requires minimal effort and no sacrifice or risk on my part then i dont have any problem with it
8123935 what if on your way to let the dog out you tripped and broke your leg
8123936 well you would have wished that you didnt get up to let the dog out wouldnt you
8123937 no i think i would wish i hadnt of broken my leg
8123938 i love my family i love my motorcycle i love a lot of the things about my life
8123939 but do you love your life do you love yourself
8123940 love is an emotional reaction to a feeling brought on by external sources since you are never outside yourself how can you love yourself i mean you can be content with yourself you can even be proud or enjoy being yourself but love is something else at least to me it is
8123941 well now we seem to be in a disagreement because i happen to know the opposite of this isnt true i have known you for many years and on more then one occasion you have uttered that you hate yourself how can you hate yourself but not love yourself
8123942 well druid i am going to put aside that we are using two extremes here love and hate two words i would want stricken from my vocabulary because just to acknowledge them as possibilities puts faith in the dichotomy loving or hating instead of putting faith in the fact that love and hate are not opposites but instead complimentary functions in order to love a part of something we must hate another part of it in order to feel any love in life we must also feel hate putting that aside though hate is not a reaction to an external phenomena but instead a reaction to an internal action hate beings on the inside whereas love begins on the outside
8123943 well give me an example of something you hate or something like that
8123944 goodness i am not going to use myself as an example for whatever blundering mess of verbiage that you are about to use here use the example of how nazis hate jews
8123945 well that is a generalization and i do not life using such things but ok a nazi does not hate a jew because of what the jew is a nazi hates a jew because of what a nazi is
8123946 if a jew was perfectly disguised as a nazi would the nazi hate it no the nazi would think that it was another nazi the hatred for jews comes from a nazis internal perception of what is a jew not the jew itself you have to hate something internally before you can hate it externally whereas you have to love something externally before you can love it internally make sense
8123947 no but it is rare that anything you say ever does may i ask you a question robert
8123948 how could you put lemon in my diet coke im allergic to lemon i cant drink this
8123949 i used to work in a restaurant and gthis is not how a restaurant should be run how could you serve this
8123950 mas que mente polu da o que voc tem de errado
8123951 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage
8123952 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8123953 the next thing i knew there was a loud explosion and black smoke
8123954 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8123955 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8123956 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8123957 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8123958 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8123959 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8123960 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8123961 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8123962 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8123963 the depth and breadth of appdev courses provide a great level of training which i have found lacking in other training programs the customer support at appdev is fantastic i have been using appdev for several years and i highly recommend this training
8123964 fam lias que vivem em reas pass veis de serem inundadas

8123967 acordem estados unidos se existissem os jogos ol mpicos para o engano a m administra o e o desvio esta administra o ficaria com o ouro e bateria o recorde mundial pela viola o do direito nacional e internacional
8123968 estas elei es n o s o para escolher entre o liberal e o conservador entre a esquerda e a direita s o para escolher entre o futuro e o passado
8123969 atualmente neste momento vital da nossa hist ria temos uma oportunidade de acertar e a situa o atual simplesmente n o nos favorece
8123970 precisamos de um presidente que entenda o mundo de hoje o futuro que queremos e a mudan a que necessitamos precisamos de barack obama
8123971 foi excelente um discurso firme deixou claro que vamos estar unidos em novembro para ganhar esta elei o
8123972 i know you wouldnt mind it jig its really not anything its just to let the air in
8123973 ill go with you and ill stay with you all the time they just let the air in and then its all perfectly natural
8123974 well be fine afterward just like we were before i know we will you dont have to be afraid ive known lots of people that have done it
8123975 its a simple operation jig its not an operation at all its to let the air in its not anything
8123976 the cumulative numbers arent staggering and he has never won 20 games a cy young award or a ring but his won loss percentage is impressive and hes climbing the strikeout rankings
8123977 one more good season however and hell be bert blyleven with almost 100 fewer losses
8123978 if you take a snapshot of then and a snapshot of now its quite a difference
8123979 i was unsure what 08 was going to be like was i going to be a starter are they going to ask me to pitch in relief am i going to be on the team all year they were questions ive never had to ask myself i was hoping to be important to the club
8123980 baseball is a funny game and theres stuff you cant control
8123981 im about six or seven outs away from two perfect games a 20 win season and a world series ring i was three outs away from winning a world series in 2001 with mariano rivera on the mound what more can i ask for
8123982 to be able to get 20 wins at 39 its remarkable
8123983 im hoping he gets 22 or 23 we need the wins hes been our most successful pitcher his season is of the utmost importance to us
8123984 its going quickly were rolling into september when you are winning it always moves along
8123985 it was one of the toughest things i had to do as a manager
8123986 a lot of players play through stuff they shouldnt play through
8123987 he came into spring training with the mind set that he had to earn a rotation job
8123988 our mind set was that if he was healthy he was going to be able to pitch
8123989 hes commanding all quadrants of the strike zone hes changing speeds and he can fix mechanical flaws on the fly how many guys can lose 5 to 8 mph off their fastball and have a chance to win 20 games at age 39 it doesnt happen by luck
8123990 i want to keep batters in the box flat footed
8123991 his changeup has added a different realm of how slow hes able to throw his pinpoint control with his breaking ball is exceptional hes improved his repertoire
8123992 to me it was his best highlight with the yankees for the time that i was there
8123993 i dont see how that makes me a better pitcher
8123994 the total would be higher but the way i got there wouldnt be special
8123995 it is 10 minutes if i have to wait at a stop sign
8123996 this job the places we go can be fast paced
8123997 im not really happy about the way i played just happy about the win
8123998 we were both tight its never easy to play against another frenchwoman
8123999 i will have to step up to another level in the next one
8124000 este o momento de unir o partido estamos no mesmo time ningu m pode ficar de fora

8124014 the stock routes are managed at the moment by 47 rural lands protection boards which look after them for biodiversity values and things like that
8124015 a review has recommended to the nsw government that travelling stock routes should be ceded back to the department of lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention which means they have to be profitable
8124016 this means the department of lands can do whatever they see fit with their routes they can lease them or sell them or do whatever they like
8124017 the drovers and environmentalists agree that the network should stay connected and not as bits and pieces of land that all have different values with different developments on them
8124018 he should be able to return to wrestling in two to four months john will be working out next week we performed this same procedure on three all pro nfl players and all three resumed their football careers

8124040 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8124041 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8124042 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8124043 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8124044 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8124045 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody

8124053 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8124054 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8124055 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8124056 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8124057 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing
8124058 i never really like talking too much about an injury because if you play well they say man look how tough he is
8124059 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
8124060 he and marvin harrison have been together forever and this is my eighth year so you kind of get used to it
8124061 ive always been confident hell be ready for the opener
8124062 r det s h r v rlden k nns klockan fem p morgonen
8124063 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
8124064 but that was painful just being able to move your leg in a full rotation that was probably the most difficult part that was very very painful
8124065 it was definitely frustrating being out and at times it was very very hard just to see your team out there and you know youre not helping your team out your friends out but now im back and im trying to do everything possible to help the team
8124066 i think hes potentially the best tight end in this conference and maybe the country
8124067 hes a very powerful man he blocks extremely well he can get down the field hes got strong hands catching the football and then hes able to run with the football after he catches it
8124068 im a much more mature player i know that i have to work hard i know that i cant sit back and think the game is going to be promised to me because the game could be gone on one play or not even in a game thats how i tore my acl in the first place
8124069 i got to learn coach obriens program while i was out i got my flexibility up as well there were a whole lot of positives that came out of it i like to call it a minor setback for a major comeback you know i feel like i have stepped up my game a lot because i was out and thats why im so eager for thursday to get here
8124070 i got a whole lot of rehab and a lot of times i was there by myself and it was definitely tough
8124071 but you know all i ever thought about was all the things i had been through before i mean i went to hargrave and that was harder than any kind of rehab that ive ever went through i had coach amato with me two or three years before that and his system is hard
8124072 you think about all the things youve been through and it keeps you going i looked at rehab as almost like going through football practice whether you want to do it or you dont want to do it its something youve got to do
8124073 losing a player of his caliber like we did last year was a tough loss for the team
8124074 but hes back hes ready to go it was a blessing in disguise because hes on track to get his degree in december which he probably wouldnt have done if he would have left so i think everything worked out the best for him and hopefully hell have a great year
8124075 i looked at it more as a racer a competitive thing
8124076 i just felt it was the right thing for me to do to come over here i feel this team is definitely heading in the right direction
8124077 fairly fast this is the first time ive been in this type of situation
8124078 they knew what they wanted and i knew what i wanted it seems pretty nice how it happened they believe in me as a driver and that means a lot and i believe in them as a team
8124079 i wasnt going to come back i talked to felix this past weekend felix isnt around the track a lot hes a very busy man
8124080 a lot of times i try to just talk to chip about things but felix told me i could call him anytime and that was one of those deals where you dont want to break up a friendship thats for sure i feel like i can still be friends with both of those guys
8124081 any type of breakup like that is not the easiest thing in the world for either side but i felt it went fairly well i think its ok
8124082 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have more opportunities to win races
8124083 this is a sport where change is something that happens you see it more often now than in the past i think everybody understands
8124084 i was at the shop yesterday with some of the guys some of the crew guys and with my crew chief and things like that and people understand why i have to make a change i think everybody respects that and it goes both ways
8124085 starting his fourth team but when you do things like that you have to go through that process
8124086 its obviously not a fun process to go through thats for sure having that extra pressure on you
8124087 but at the same time i feel like this at evernhams is where i want to be between last year and this year they have definitely made progress just talking with elliot sadler and kasey kahne soon to be his new teammates they seem really happy with everything thats going on the whole organization seems like its structured really well
8124088 i ran the busch car the first year we had a great amount of success even moving into the cup series in 2006 we had some decent runs obviously i was a rookie but it seemed like we had some fast cars
8124089 from that point on its just a little slide downhill its not lack of effort on anybodys part everybody has been working really hard trying to figure out where we can find some speed
8124090 but it seems this year has been the worst year of the three
8124091 i felt ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8124092 we were negotiating certain things with ganassi and sabates and what it comes down to is where i wanted to be and this gillett evernham is where i felt like i wanted to be
8124093 were moving forward with it and im sure that sometime before 3 31 p m on saturday well have it figured out
8124094 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8124095 julio you know what i actually ran into julio in the spring recruiting
8124096 i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats serious
8124097 its the last chance i get to show my talents i expect to get a lot of playing time a lot of reps so i have to take advantage of it
8124098 but you know life is full of ups and downs and its not what happens to you its how you handle it its how you bounce back and im bouncing back right now
8124099 they told me theres an opportunity for you to come out here and make plays and help us win ballgames
8124100 once i got there it kind of wasnt like that being honest that was a great coaching staff but they were young coaches and he lane kiffin had some guys from college there and thats who he went with so you know its a funny business man
8124101 my body tells me ive still got it and the guys compliment me on my routes and stuff i come out here each and every day and i want to be here things have been going good im not catching too many balls in preseason games but at the same time its more than that its blocking downfield and springing the running backs open for long runs so im trying to do my part
8124102 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8124103 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8124104 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8124105 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8124106 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8124107 re create 68 with the goal of re igniting the
8124108 please know that we receive a high volume of mail due to this high volume our records show that we have not received your check please note that this does not necessarily mean the check has not been received
8124109 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8124110 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8124111 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8124112 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8124113 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8124114 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8124115 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8124116 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8124117 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8124118 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8124119 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8124120 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8124121 it was already mission impossible before and now it will be even more difficult
8124122 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8124123 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8124124 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8124125 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8124126 now the west cant look away anymore and georgias point of view is becoming difficult to ignore its way too early to make long term predictions but it could positively influence nato and the eu towards georgia
8124127 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8124128 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8124129 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8124130 i think at the moment its a lot to ask for
8124131 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense said school superintendent david thweatt of the harrold independent school district
8124132 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8124133 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree said doug pennington spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence
8124134 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count mr thweatt said
8124135 they were like fish in a barrel mr thweatt said
8124136 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12 he said many eventually joined the rodeo circuit or work in the oil fields
8124137 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual
8124138 a lot of responsibility for someone who already has a lot of responsibility in the classroom
8124139 as far as we are aware this is the first policy of its kind at the elementary or high school level
8124140 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense

8124142 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time

8124144 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8124145 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8124146 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8124147 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said

8124152 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8124153 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8124154 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8124155 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8124156 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8124157 hey sweet i can read this article on a shirt instead of a computer screen ha ha arent i funny for suggesting such a thing because i live on freakin planet earth where someones ass would get fired for that kind of nonsense right
8124158 i dont feel completely ready to go out there against say rutgers and start
8124159 im getting that way and i feel comfortable i could go out and play if they did need me but its taking time i understand that its going great but its going to take time
8124160 our level of confidence in him to go in and play linebacker is that he would go out there and he would execute the things we need to get executed for that game
8124161 coach davis is confident in my ability to learn the linebacker position
8124162 hes been in football so long that i trust what he said
8124163 and i was ready for maybe a new role on the team things didnt work out for one reason or another on offense i was ready to try a new role at least i was excited to do it because it was another thing to get focused on and learn and try to do well
8124164 every day he goes out he gets better and better
8124165 hes a great tackler and he has an unbelievable motor his deal is he wants to play so bad that hes going to do anything he can to help us out the more he learns the better hes going to get
8124166 ive been doing this ive kicked off before and ive played on some pretty big stages
8124167 i hope theres a more veteran side of me but i guess well just have to wait until the 30th to see
8124168 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8124169 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time

8124177 any further and our customer connection attempt is rejected with the declaration transmission loss too high
8124178 that message occurs if the line produces a signal attenuation over its length exceeding the allowable limit for a traditional analog voice service since nakedextreme uses an unbundled local loop service it doesnt need to co exist with analog telephony which means we can deliver broadband much further from the exchange
8124179 weve had some customers working at six to seven kilometres some of them get a fantastic service
8124180 i think theyve got good players but were not real sure how theyre going to use their talent
8124181 i hope it helps us having veterans on the defensive side of the football
8124182 coach briles has a great reputation as an offensive football coach houston drove people crazy they were one of the top offenses in the country
8124183 if you can go play somebody without a lot of knowledge of what theyre going to do in terms of personnel and scheme i think it helps if youve got more veteran players no question
8124184 theyll give us a lot of sets a lot of motion and a lot of things to look at
8124185 we have to just do a really good job of reacting
8124186 when you see something weve got to hit it we know that no matter what theyre running as long as were playing fast and we can match their intensity once the third and fourth quarters hit it will all be about who is mentally sharp
8124187 going into our fifth year we have seen pretty much any offense
8124188 we dont know what theyre going to do but were going by what we hear
8124189 if the freshman is on the field apparently he has a really strong arm he had a great high school career and hes obviously really really fast so you have to at least on defense think that this guy might run with the football a little bit
8124190 the quarterback they had last year threw the ball a lot of course the kid who transferred in from miami throws the ball a lot my guess would be that theyve probably got some packages in mind for those quarterbacks and if they play all three some are probably doing some things better than others
8124191 in fact hes the no 2 tight end right now so hes going to play
8124192 he looked really good in practice hes back to running again
8124193 i think hes going to be ok whether hes full speed or not well find out thursday

8124197 it was two against one you know and no one helped him
8124198 i didnt think that it would happen but it was not safe for him to work there
8124199 blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god
8124200 blessed are you who are hungry now for you shall be satisfied
8124201 blessed are you who weep now for you shall laugh
8124202 blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the son of man
8124203 but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation
8124204 woe to you who are full now for you shall be hungry
8124205 woe to you who laugh now for you shall mourn and weep
8124206 woe to you when all people speak well of you for so their fathers did to the false prophets i guess most of us are famliar with these verses or at least the beatitudes i used to believe that they are for everybody but now i find that these are really meant for jesus disciples that is to say those who decide to follow him of course these beatitudes and woes can also be adapted to non believers but here i think jesus means mainly for the disciples for it is stated
8124207 then what can we disciples get from these beatitudes and woes
8124208 blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are you who are hungry now for you shall be satisfied blessed are you who weep now for you shall laugh blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the son of men rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for so their fathers did to the prophets
8124209 but woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation woe to you who are full now for you shall be hungry woe to you who laugh now for you shall mourn and weep woe to you when all people speak well of you for so their fathers did to the false prophets

8124222 they made that a known fact when i came here for my visit
8124223 they made sure i knew that they really needed me to help whether i started or not that was one of the reasons i wanted to come here
8124224 i think hes going to be an exceptional football player for us
8124225 were really excited about him he established himself in the spring and has sustained that having a good preseason camp hes a very strong powerful quick and explosive guy
8124226 hes a strong athletic football player with great work ethic he has tremendous leverage and quickness for his size were glad to have him
8124227 those georgia military guys are that way theyve been coached hard in high school they play hard
8124228 malcolm came in and it was like he had been here for three years hes not a high maintenance guy hes a blue collar go to work guy who is happy to be here he has great work habits and hes a genuinely likable good guy that everybody here has taken to

8124247 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8124248 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8124249 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
8124250 i think everybodys best interests are in patching it up
8124251 oh shit i should probably learn how to read the notes on the actual page instead of just remembering the placement with my fingers
8124252 il fattore scatenante di questa decisione una diagnosi medica di una brutta malattia
8124253 devon is probably the most complete of the bunch and hell get the lions share
8124254 he has game experience and we can trust him right now this will be his third year of people counting on him none of the other guys have seen the lights but well try to use all of them
8124255 robert has had a great camp and hes probably quicker than he gets credit for
8124256 devin can really help us but the zone play out of the shotgun is still foreign to him its different than what hes done but hes busted long runs every scrimmage weve had he can really run and cedric has had a good camp and he gives us more quickness than the rest of them
8124257 i think they all know theyll play and theyre all helping each other out
8124258 we had success with that last year and weve probably called it more in camp than we have in the past
8124259 we get into game situations who knows well take what they give us but we have been successful with it now that weve got four of them maybe well do more of it
8124260 its an ncaa rule that in the division that were in lower division i we can only bring 90 players to camp before school starts
8124261 in the bowl division they can bring 105 to camp the thing that happened to us this year and it can happen to anybody is that we had a large number of kids with hamstrings and stuff like that where theyd miss time
8124262 i would hope that the ncaa particularly if youre opening up against a i a school would allow you to bring in more players you may not have 105 guys but 98 would have helped us just because of nagging injuries and things like that
8124263 the euro had a similar move this morning he said
8124264 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point
8124265 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8124266 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp he said
8124267 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers
8124268 this is about competition issues and they are the same for both companies so it is not necessary for both companies to go to court
8124269 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward
8124270 we are confident that we can capture the majority of the margin improvement that will come from the upturn in the markets through to the net profit line when those investment returns finally turn around he said
8124271 the overwhelming driver of our funds balance this year has regrettably been the negative investment returns mr robinson said
8124272 but theres no doubt that when you talk to advisers it is quieter than historically it has been
8124273 that means the fund flow to us from new clients is a little slow mr robinson said
8124274 we would certainly look at opportunities larger than the current cash availability inside the business he said
8124275 we rode that wave in radio really well he said
8124276 this year the august month was clearly impacted by the olympics we expected that
8124277 but over that national advertising is certainly softer tighter more cautious than it was 12 months ago
8124278 relatively well and flagged cost cuts to adapt to the tougher environment
8124279 theres not a significant benefit in terms of a platform we can offer to national advertisers if were at three rather than five mr dorney said
8124280 obviously that is having an impact on what is going on with the market hardly doing anything mr chatterton said from brisbane
8124281 we are hardly going to have any big movers out there
8124282 a fair bit of that has already been accounted into the market he said
8124283 that is just a normal day these days he said
8124284 the volatility we are getting at the moment 1 per cent is a fairly modest day
8124285 of course every infant has a right to lifesaving medical attention even if its not wanted
8124286 do not attempt to kill the baby in the uterus the goal is simply to prematurely deliver a baby who dies during the birth process or soon afterward
8124287 it is not uncommon for a live aborted baby to linger for an hour or two or even longer at christ hospital one lived for almost an entire eight hour shift
8124288 baptismal supplies gowns and certificates footprinting equipment and baby bracelets for mementos and a rocking chair
8124289 babies were taken to the soiled utility room to die
8124290 every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
8124291 breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
8124292 affirm deny or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive
8124293 not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8124294 you know this is really very boring but somehow you arent bored
8124295 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workmanlike speech
8124296 lets see if i were jeremy fisher where would i be
8124297 if you force assad to choose to leave the alliance with tehran first as a condition for u s support for the peace talks hell never do it
8124298 you have to offer a slow choice he will gradually discover he doesnt need the alliance with iran
8124299 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8124300 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8124301 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8124302 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8124303 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
8124304 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
8124305 what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8124306 at a time of high energy prices and instability in global markets it is important to understand that events in georgia part of a strategic energy corridor affect individual lives far beyond the caucasus
8124307 were destroyed or controlled by russia global energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to moscows influence with serious consequences on the world energy market
8124308 contrary to the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
8124309 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8124310 there is no way you can dash or cancel or terminate a security council resolution by force
8124311 the only body that is able to change a resolution of the security council is the security council itself
8124312 far reaching decision that will have wide ranging implications i think even beyond the georgia situation
8124313 are a concern as they may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand
8124314 we owe it to stephanie we owe it to the dreamers we owe it to the people who say we will not build these last eight years again in this great country
8124315 we will pick up the pieces we will dream like paterson
8124316 we experienced a few initial issues with the cards but the problems have all been resolved
8124317 contrary to a few reports we continue to use the sustainable cards and plan to use them throughout the remainder of the democratic national convention
8124318 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring
8124319 i think you can debate how many years it should be
8124320 whether they should have been put in at two terms or three terms thats something you could debate
8124321 i dont know how influential any one group is in changing the publics mind
8124322 i think the public is pretty smart they get their information not from any one story or any one editorial they get it over a long period of time
8124323 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first
8124324 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8124325 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8124326 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8124327 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8124328 whatever achievements i have made i am always aware of how lucky i am
8124329 there were people i knew who were smarter than me there were those who worked harder and perhaps were more dedicated but for the lack of opportunities one of them would be standing here talking to you this evening
8124330 the overall promise that this nation has made that if a person works hard enough he can make the most of their god given talents
8124331 so the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america well lets see is it john mccain
8124332 so if hes the answer the question must be ridiculous
8124333 couldnt care less that my country has come in 83rd
8124334 theres a little bit of a misunderstanding that we were targeting nypd officers
8124335 in reality we were targeting graduates from john jay college we werent trying to steal nypd officers but we do have a very aggressive recruitment policy
8124336 significantly higher top pay offered by the seattle police department is very likely to attract fully trained and experienced members of the nypd
8124337 its the nations largest city a very diverse population other cities have tried too
8124338 its probably indicative of a bottoming out in this mess
8124339 it would appear that the worst is over in terms of nonstop declines in value
8124340 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8124341 hes giving me a wild card into the draw im going to play
8124342 we were making jokes at the olympics that i should try to compete in something else because i was just doing running and sprints
8124343 we have a plaintiff who for four years now has been prohibited from criticizing an investigation he believes is illegitimate
8124344 the problem with the statute is that it gives the fbi power to suppress speech that is critical of the fbi
8124345 one emergency could mean disaster for one of these families simply because they dont have access to the protections the state provides to married families to help them weather a storm
8124346 the instructors are great they know their tennis theyre very patient and they give us excellent drills
8124347 i try to teach them how to be their best because they already have great instructors teaching them how to hit the ball
8124348 what tennis is about is getting yourself into the right frame of mind so you get your performance up to what youre capable of
8124349 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first
8124350 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8124351 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8124352 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8124353 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8124354 are a concern as they may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand
8124355 john mccain has been out talking to democrats and independents women and hispanics for many many months
8124356 bromides of such a generic nature that we dont know where he would actually lead
8124357 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
8124358 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success
8124359 this is a great honor being nominated vice president of the united states
8124360 im proud of it i dont mean in any way to diminish it but it pales in comparison to the honor that ive had representing you i apologize for getting a little emotional
8124361 i dont care what they think i wish we could have done this in private because you know i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys
8124362 right now were living in the world as it is and we are settling
8124363 theres no reason why we cant have universal health care in this country theres absolutely no reason why we cant do that as somebody whos worked in the health care profession it is something that would save this country billions and billions of dollars if you think about all of the preventative medicine that is not going on
8124364 there is absolutely no reason why united states shouldnt have the best education that this planet can offer the money is there
8124365 i dont know that i can tell you what his opponent will do
8124366 look you know whats coming folks you know whats coming from the republicans
8124367 youre going to see on some of the shows after this is all over that joe biden michelle obama four distinguished governors four incredible women with a story all they talked about was how were going to spend more money its typical tax and spend democrats theyre going to try to scare the rest of america into the notion that we are going to go well beyond our economic reach
8124368 what is the greater obligation of the country to give some very very wealthy people who are good people an additional 100 billion in tax cuts or provide health care for every american and solve every story you heard up here
8124369 sweeping statements about the cost saving potential of prevention however are overreaching
8124370 although some preventive measures do save money the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not
8124371 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8124372 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance
8124373 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8124374 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8124375 thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up together we made history
8124376 john mccain promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids
8124377 he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you thats just not right thats four more years that we just cant afford
8124378 if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last very long
8124379 if an idea works it doesnt matter whether its got a d or an r next to it this election is not about liberal versus conservative not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8124380 this race is all about the future and thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8124381 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
8124382 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
8124383 in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neocon artists seized the economy and added 4 trillion of unproductive spending to the national debt
8124384 we have a case of a small democratic nation attacked by a large autocratic neighbor
8124385 i think the case speaks for itself what georgia is guilty for is that we dont want to be part of this autocratic system and we want to have a right to choose to choose our democratic system to choose values and to choose our security arrangements like nato its about values democracy and protection of human rights it should be very important to liberals
8124386 im glad theyre here to explain this to people who are not as aware of the situation as i am
8124387 i told them i for one was very sympathetic to the cause of georgian freedom we should not allow the russians to operate with impunity there
8124388 i think what we very much appreciate is that georgia is a bipartisan issue in american politics and we very much appreciate that we hear very good statements from senator obama very good statements from senator mccain
8124389 this should be a bipartisan issue and we very much value the support of the democratic party on this
8124390 in iraq the situation was very different it was an internationally recognized crisis saddam hussein was recognized as a person who conducted ethnic cleansing against his own population
8124391 a half century ago president kennedy said if you want to learn something about freedom come to berlin
8124392 today we say if you want to learn something about freedom come to tbilisi
8124393 this is a historic day for h p and eds and for the clients we serve
8124394 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
8124395 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8124396 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8124397 we are excited about our partnership with hp and believe our clients in the federal state local governments and the commercial market segment will benefit from this partnership all of these sectors are seeking secure and sophisticated collaboration solutions and services
8124398 most importantly ezenia s government customers which require 100 uptime on their networks are already inclined to purchase carrier class fault tolerant servers knowing our scalable and reliable collaboration solution will work seamlessly on hps fault tolerant carrier grade servers should prove to be a win win for ezenia hp and all our customers
8124399 the developers we feel have no interest in working with this community or even being a part of it and have no interest in assuring that kew gardens remains a great place to live
8124400 they only want a profit and to continue what has become the overdevelopment of queens
8124401 the zoning for this particular site is wrong the zoning should be changed to better reflect the character of the neighborhood and the traffic patterns that are here
8124402 this neighborhood cannot handle that much more congestion traffic pollution
8124403 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve
8124404 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
8124405 a bicycle contest was commenced at the agricultural hall on monday last for which 150 is offered in prizes for a six days competition
8124406 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first
8124407 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8124408 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8124409 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8124410 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8124411 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve
8124412 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
8124413 i believe since it started in the sovereign state of darfur it is more likely something to do with the rebels in that area
8124414 it never requested to land on egyptian soil we understand that it had a tank that would allow it to fly for four hours it flew directly toward kufra
8124415 we are in contact with libyan officials because of this dangerous event
8124416 we want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers
8124417 there were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane we checked the plane like we do with all other planes we followed the regular security checkup we still dont have any information on what type of weapons were used
8124418 the situation escalated into confrontation and exchange of gunfire with no indication as to who started it
8124419 on the basis of information provided to the unamid team while on site the casualty toll amounted to 64 killed and 117 wounded of which 49 were evacuated by unamid to the nyala hospital
8124420 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the government security forces against civilians which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties
8124421 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8124422 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8124423 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8124424 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8124425 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8124426 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8124427 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8124428 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8124429 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8124430 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job
8124431 this is really not a safety issue this is an aggravation issue
8124432 it happens its just weird because youre sitting and you dont know if its going to be 20 minutes or 2 hours
8124433 theyre releasing the planes but on a one by one basis so its really backed the whole system up at least in the atlanta area
8124434 i dont really want to spend the rest of the evening in the airport im hoping they get this fixed
8124435 were just coming back from europe were really tired and this is bad news
8124436 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
8124437 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
8124438 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
8124439 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his september 16 threat
8124440 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
8124441 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia
8124442 we are now trying to improve the conditions of the pilots recordings of the four audio channels of voice some channels have the information in a better state than others there will have to be filtering
8124443 a high price has been paid with 154 deaths and 18 people injured
8124444 our work must go deep into the causes of the accident we hope not to let down society
8124445 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8124446 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
8124447 please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
8124448 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
8124449 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the deals
8124450 can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help
8124451 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
8124452 zal has been a voice of strong criticism that goes way beyond u s policy of the government of karzai and that opinion reflects his personal view
8124453 this has been a problem going back two years on the pakistan account
8124454 the pakistan political situation is highly unstable right now and the last thing the u s needs is for it to become the central focus of that instability through accusations that it is propping up or scheming behind the scenes with one of the major political players
8124455 pakistani leaders are also guilty of putting too much attention on currying favor with u s leaders rather than focusing on governing their own country and dealing with the myriad of challenges there
8124456 he is the former ambassador to iraq and afghanistan his close relationship to the president has been acknowledged
8124457 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government
8124458 it is irresponsible to engage in that dialogue while you are a sitting official and taking an oath to be a representative of the u s government
8124459 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8124460 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8124461 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8124462 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8124463 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8124464 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8124465 she knew he was running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8124466 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8124467 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
8124468 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
8124469 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
8124470 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
8124471 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8124472 gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8124473 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered that the claims
8124474 chupan con el gober son los que tiene cargos importantes no la gente con verdadera capacidad para ello
8124475 ex gobernantes militantes distinguidos y dirigentes perredistas que han sido en otras pocas
8124476 llamo a mis compa eros militantes del prd en guerrero y en acapulco particularmente en acapulco a rectificar y cerrar filas con el prd y su candidato gloria sierra
8124477 hay que cerrar filas con el partido que nos ha dado la oportunidad de ser lo que somos regidores presidentes municipales diputados locales o senadores gobernadores que lo hemos sido porque tenemos un gran partido que nos respalda solos no somos ni con mucho tan importantes como lo es el prd en su conjunto
8124478 quien piense que es m s importante que el colectivo se equivoca y por lo tanto espero que militantes distinguidos y dirigentes que lo han sido en otras pocas incluso gobernantes nuestros rectifiquen y cierren filas con el prd y sus candidatos
8124479 no existe tal permiso en una militancia partidaria no vale andar jugando a los permisos para irse a la tienda de enfrente y despu s regresar tranquilamente eso no existe no s si le pidieron permiso a alguien de convergencia

8124483 wir haben keinen augenblick zu verlieren und wir k nnen auf keine stimme verzichten
8124484 das ist nicht richtig das sind vier weitere jahre die wir uns nicht leisten k nnen
8124485 amerika hat nie angst vor der zukunft gehabt und wir sollten jetzt nicht damit anfangen
8124486 barack obama ist eine charmante und anst ndige pers nlichkeit mit einer liebenswerten familie aber er ist nicht bereit f r die pr sidentschaft
8124487 viele eltern sind sehr besorgt schlie lich ist es gleich um die ecke passiert
8124488 auch wir sind familienv ter auch wir haben angst um unsere kinder
8124489 sensibilisieren sie ihre kinder warnen sie vor falschen versprechungen sch rfen sie ihren kindern ein sich durch schreien bei en oder treten zur wehr zu setzen achten sie auf verhaltens nderungen
8124490 die kinder m ssen lernen nein zu sagen wenn ihnen unwohl ist
8124491 aber ich will auch nicht dass sie hinter jedem baum einen vergewaltiger vermuten und omas nicht mehr den weg erkl ren
8124492 wir m ssen den kindern erkl ren dass manche menschen tricks anwenden um ihnen weh zu tun
8124493 auch wenn ihr kind albern aggressiv oder besonders ausgelassen ist lassen sie es zu wenn es seine gef hle zeigt
8124494 die st ndige frage nach dem warum kann keiner beantworten
8124495 aber wir m ssen die kinder bei ihren ngsten abholen
8124496 we expect japan and australia to be real threats as well as canada uk and germany are also potentially tough more importantly we are potentially bad as witnessed by occasional lackluster performances this year
8124497 este es un chico que ya demostr lo que vale como futbolista y apostaremos decididamente por los juveniles
8124498 la comparaci n es inaceptable y abiertamente divisoria claramente demuestra que cuando apoyan a barack obama las celebridades mundiales se niegan a considerar cualquier l mite a la ahora de atacar injustamente

8124501 this drawing above is dated from june of 1968 at a time when the bell star helmet was unknown in europe my inspiration was astronaut helmets the bike is aerodynamically all wrong and would have caused massive lift but the seat is virtually identical to the ones first used by don vesco at daytona in 1972 the design of this motorcycle was inspired by ray amm s 1952 norton record bike for the position kneeling rather than seated but used a center hub steering with a front swing arm a solution later picked by andre de cortanze for the elf x motorcycle in 1978 de cortanze was the designer of the team pescarolo courage c60 and also of the 1998 1999 toyota gp c the peugeot 905 lm of the 90s this design also featured an aluminum monocoque chassis fairing fuel tank the exhaust is routed under a formed resting pad under the drivers chest also note the cast wheels at a time when there were only wire wheels available for motorcycles this exact wheel design was later used by yamaha beginning in 1975 this design led to the following and more elaborate artwork devised in 1973 originally produced for the program of the us grand prix motocross in carlsbad ca in 1974 it was later re printed in the yamaha international magazine in 1975 it precedes the actual re introduction of the mono shock rear suspension by yamaha 1975 and shows many features that were quite advanced at the time such as advanced aero and inboard disc brakes not counting the bell crank rear suspension that was later adopted by kawasaki and ultimately most other motorcycle manufacturers also dated 1977 is this above sketch with annotations made on a restaurant napkin in pesaro italy during an intense conversation with dr giancarlo morbidelli the previously expressed general ideas are retained but check this out the front suspension is now a wide double a arm system with a profiled cast magnesium rigid fork incorporating cast in brake calipers the system adjustable for camber as well as trail and using a sophisticated inboard koni shock there is adjustable ratio steering controlled by rods and heim joints power is fed to the rear swing arm axle by a constant tension chain a second constant tension chain driving the wheel over a single side arm
8124502 the mayor is tremendously supportive of me and the doi

8124505 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workmanlike speech
8124506 if you force assad to choose to leave the alliance with tehran first as a condition for u s support for the peace talks hell never do it

8124532 langkah pertama yang harus dilakukan madrid dalam upayanya merekrut david villa adalah dengan memenuhi semua persyaratan dari valencia setelah itu baru kami akan memutuskan sebab sejauh ini kami tidak memiliki pemain yang berstatus tidak dijual
8124533 selain villa kami juga memiliki beberapa nama yang masuk dalam daftar jual tercatat kami memiliki 8 9 pemain yang masuk dalam agenda penjualan
8124534 thanks for sharing such lively genuine conversations about the work of real psychiatrists
8124535 feeling like i am in a friendly mental health discussion group with other fun witty professionals how providers talk shop amongst themselves
8124536 wonderful blend of information and humor feels like friends a little nerdy a little goofy interesting and loveable
8124537 winning combination of likeable mildly argumentative and almost always interesting personalities often laugh out loud funny
8124538 gidp 115 10th youre suprised were only 10th tigers heading to arizona
8124539 managers are expendable i believe there should be relief managers just like charlie grimm
8124540 if the cubs and the white sox both make it to the world series
8124541 oh thats easy white sox im not one of these fair weather fans you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching
8124542 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
8124543 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
8124544 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
8124545 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill up there for five minutes and let her throw some red meat out to the crowd
8124546 t he republicans are going to use from day one through day four to hammer sen barack obama
8124547 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill d mo up there for five minutes and let her throw some red meat out to the crowd
8124548 si se le exige al ciudadano la m xima contenci n en estos momentos complicados nosotros somos los primeros que debemos dar ejemplo
8124549 hemos reestructurado el rea econ mica del ayuntamiento para poner en marcha esta oficina que estar supervisada por la figura del viceinterventor

8124551 do you think that that person even knows that they are doing it
8124552 not does that person know whether they are doing it but whether they think it is wrong
8124553 la sensibilidad del equipo de gobierno del ayuntamiento y del alcalde
8124554 a pesar de que muchas de ellas eran especies aut ctonas
8124555 quienes mantienen estos jardines s lo recogen la basura de la zona de la barbacoa y no tocan una planta
8124556 un a o despu s la inversi n del ayuntamiento ha sido poner s lo 10 12 barbacoas mientras desde 2001 no se ha repuesto una sola planta y el goteo est en desuso
8124557 faltan barandillas y bancos las p rgolas est n rotas esto es un peque o gran desastre que bajo la excusa de que hay escasez de agua nadie asume
8124558 de forma sencilla con especies aut ctonas y una jardiner a sostenible que requiera un m nimo de mantenimiento
8124559 desde el principio se hizo mal porque lo hicieron de albero y en cuesta as que a los 15 d as la lluvia se lo llev todo
8124560 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company
8124561 customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages
8124562 now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heartwarming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages
8124563 by latching onto the latest fad generated by the homosexual special interest groups hallmark is negating its image as a wholesome company that promotes american values and pro family principles in its products
8124564 american businesses have a corporate responsibility to the public that buys their products
8124565 instead of bolstering campaigns by special interest groups like the homosexual activists corporations like hallmark should be protecting american culture from those forces that would destroy the family and create a public environment that is detrimental to general well being especially childrens well being
8124566 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
8124567 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8124568 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8124569 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia
8124570 no ha sido una opci n f cil pero es la nica posibilidad de garantizar la vida de la gente

8124574 sale m s caro llenar el tanque pero yo sigo echando lo mismo porque necesito coger el coche aunque a final de mes se nota bastante
8124575 excepto hoy que tengo llevar equipaje porque voy a granada
8124576 hace un a o llenar el tanque me costaba cuatro euros y ahora me cuesta seis ahora cojo la moto para el trabajo pero el coche prefiero no usarlo porque a la larga me sale m s caro aun as tambi n se nota lo cara que es la gasolina en el uso de la moto
8124577 lo nico que s es que no es normal tanto subir los precios yo no tengo m s remedio que coger el coche pero intento echar menos gasolina hoy por ejemplo unos 20 euros
8124578 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
8124579 un pueblo que olvida su pasado esta condenado a repetir sus err res
8124580 the accusations are baseless and do not make sense the bank of china will respond to the suit to clarify and ensure a correct understanding of the facts by going through the legal procedures
8124581 we will reserve the right to lodge a counter claim and other necessary legal actions we believe the us court will make just rulings in accordance with the law and the facts
8124582 theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done
8124583 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8124584 okay so what will it take for you to give us your business and let us manage your portfolio so you can spend that time on something more fun
8124585 going with the flow through atlanta at 85 mph so i pick my time to drive there
8124586 have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot and anyone going faster than you is a maniac
8124587 just assume your new digital camera is disposable because guaranteed whatever you pick it will be upgraded or obsolete in the next year in the interim while learning digital youve saved the cost of your camera body in the value of film amp processing alone
8124588 how can you tell who these stores are well resellerratings com is a good place to check on most online stores
8124589 the reason for tooling around on two wheels is simple
8124590 these bikes can get places any other vehicle cant these mobile medics have even been known to fly down flights of stairs to respond to an emergency
8124591 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8124592 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8124593 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8124594 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8124595 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8124596 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8124597 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8124598 it was already mission impossible before and now it will be even more difficult
8124599 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8124600 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8124601 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8124602 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8124603 now the west cant look away anymore and georgias point of view is becoming difficult to ignore its way too early to make long term predictions but it could positively influence nato and the eu towards georgia
8124604 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8124605 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8124606 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8124607 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8124608 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8124609 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8124610 the allegations centre around the period of 1970 to the early 1980s so at this stage all the enquiries are at least over 20 years old
8124611 id imagine it would be very hard for anyone thats subject to these sort of things to come forward
8124612 the republicans are trying to make offshore drilling the gay marriage issue of the 2008 election
8124613 bob shrum told me it didnt play with the focus groups
8124614 john mccain was awol when his country needed him on this
8124615 if you increase renewables it is not detrimental to other sources
8124616 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8124617 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8124618 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8124619 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8124620 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8124621 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8124622 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8124623 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8124624 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8124625 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8124626 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8124627 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8124628 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8124629 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8124630 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom

8124647 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense said school superintendent david thweatt of the harrold independent school district
8124648 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8124649 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree said doug pennington spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence
8124650 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count mr thweatt said
8124651 they were like fish in a barrel mr thweatt said
8124652 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12 he said many eventually joined the rodeo circuit or work in the oil fields
8124653 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual
8124654 a lot of responsibility for someone who already has a lot of responsibility in the classroom
8124655 as far as we are aware this is the first policy of its kind at the elementary or high school level
8124656 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense said school superintendent david thweatt of the harrold independent school district
8124657 when we got here in america the church received us warmly
8124658 from time to time we would be invaded by thugs
8124659 when i first saw a supermarket i thought it was a miracle
8124660 ive never seen such a huge store with all kinds of food
8124661 i praise the lord and thank the lord day and night we have found imani where it is easy to worship and i can get fed spiritually
8124662 we do it that way because it helps them learn english
8124663 we also give them the opportunity to sing in their language
8124664 they need each other it gives them a sense of identity and consecutiveness
8124665 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution

8124672 there are not too many parks like ours in the sydney metropolitan area
8124673 i have a relatively stable job and decent income so i planned to make some investment then i realized how fast stocks and funds were falling and that bank deposits resulted only in negative interest rates and prices are rising so fast i better spend the money to make my life more comfortable
8124674 the global economic environment is bad and the china government does not have a second key project for investment like the olympics i guess economy might slow down in the following period but so long as the regulatory policies are appropriate i believe the economy will continue to improve
8124675 houses are expensive and house prices might fall further banks are tightening their mortgage policies so i might as well wait instead of buying a house now

8124681 i dont think about typical maps when im creating a map
8124682 im putting myself in the place of a person whos gotten into an unexpected location
8124683 in advertising the old cliche is you sell the sizzle not the steak
8124684 we sell the steak thats kind of the nature of maps maps are supposed to tell the facts
8124685 were trying to convey qualitative information even though maps are essentially a quantitative vehicle
8124686 its a very unique layout and i think youll see a lot of municipalities adopt this type of map
8124687 the creative business is drawn to going outside the box but most of the money is made inside the box
8124688 its time to stop the r amp d and start applying the technology
8124689 agt was a publicly traded company and it wanted to minimize damage
8124690 i was basically threatened if i did so i would not be provided legal representation
8124691 i was even encouraged in that position by agts management
8124692 it just did not seem appropriate to allow him to participate
8124693 the way the contracts were set up everything was controlled by the arms export control act
8124694 i just felt like there should be some kind of technical line instead of a blanket provision
8124695 dkms nvidia package for your card which is the dkms nvidia 96xx you must of got my message confuse what i said to dagsljos
8124696 i dont see where he mention about the 96xx should be there but dont see it
8124697 weve been outfitting a lot of people with commuting bikes adding fenders and racks
8124698 luke is really good at what he does and im very supportive of this
8124699 im just glad to be able to do what i do in my own environment
8124700 it really is a little like stepping back in time to be in this area because the architecture harks back to the era when your grandmother lived
8124701 we personally came because of the architecture but we stayed because of the people
8124702 one of the best things about my house and a lot of fourth and gill houses is the front porch
8124703 a lot of people are walking around and you get to know everybody theres a very active community and many people in the neighborhood are my age or younger
8124704 we are all proud of and use our sidewalks and our front porches
8124705 we get out and visit each other you might borrow a cup of sugar from a neighbor or watch each others kids its more than just old architecture it has that old time spirit of a true neighborhood its a place that really feels like home
8124706 its hit us at times when we used to not be busy like 3 oclock on saturdays
8124707 it is the second top grossing theater in the knoxville market
8124708 more than 10 miles is not uncommon for riviera customers to travel
8124709 we definitely see higher box office returns for upscale films and those with a mature appeal
8124710 to be something that generated people and traffic downtown and i think its done that i do think the movie theater has played a huge role
8124711 the bottom line is the business proposition has to work
8124712 you cant build a movie theater because its great for downtown and i honestly believe theres a market
8124713 it took the mayor and regal and knox heritage preservationists and a lot of other people to make this work and we came out with a much better product
8124714 our construction drawings are in at the city for review and were trying to pull the last details together on our construction financing we hope to pull all that together within the next couple of weeks and then we hope to also be in a position to announce some of our tenants
8124715 there is demand for good quality restaurants downtown theres more demand than supply right now
8124716 obviously the key to this overall development is that every piece complements each other
8124717 id be much more comfortable if i knew these foregone tax dollars were specific to this project
8124718 the strong likelihood is that it will remain in this use or as low income housing for as much as 30 years
8124719 at times like this a lot of peoples initial response is why did this happen and how could this have been prevented
8124720 no matter what this event could not have been predicted or foreseen
8124721 be able to approach that child in a more proactive way and de escalate a situation
8124722 that information needs to be used in not judging that student but it would inform you in how you relate to that student
8124723 you want to have a policy that gives students a chance and at the same time help educators plan accordingly
8124724 so if something does happen they have that background already
8124725 there were a lot of people terrified about stigmatizing the child
8124726 are not supposed to broadcast the offense over the loudspeakers
8124727 school safety has to trump overblown considerations of a teenagers right to privacy
8124728 were not going to be able to stop every bit of violence
8124729 i suspect thats a conversation well have more of in coming weeks
8124730 theres a balance to be struck between exposing a students disciplinary record and making sure a kid has a second chance but more information is usually better
8124731 my wife and i both work full time and after we had kids there were times when she would get busy and not get home on time thats when i started helping out
8124732 i got tired of fixing and eating the same old food
8124733 it comes on every day at 4 30 p m if i get home early enough i will watch it
8124734 when he started pitching in i was like more power to you buddy
8124735 how can they make such a monumental decision without consulting the membership
8124736 would in no way be enough to establish another school buy land replace buildings relocate and reinvent themselves somewhere else
8124737 we want to talk to them about the history the heritage the tradition on this site
8124738 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
8124739 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
8124740 vooral omdat paul schruers hier zon geliefd persoon was en als eerste limburgse bisschop echt een gezicht kreeg mede dankzij de pers

8124742 het is onmogelijk om de temperatuur nu al tot op de graad nauwkeurig te voorspellen
8124743 de invloed van tropische cyclonen leidt soms tot rare sprongen in de berekeningen van de weercomputers vorige week voorspelden ze bijvoorbeeld dat het nu warm en mooi zou zijn
8124744 de computers zijn het wel eens over het weekend door een hogedrukgebied boven het noorden van duitsland wordt warme en droge landlucht aangevoerd
8124745 aan de kust vallen mogelijk rond de middag al de eerste onweersbuien
8124746 ik heb nooit een drankprobleem gehad wat mensen of media daar ook over zeggen of schrijven bij het bewuste ongeval had ik een glas te veel op net zoals jij iedereen andere spelers dat af en toe hebben was ik stomdronken neen bijlange niet dat is zwaar opgeklopt daar blijf ik bij
8124747 als mensen me ergens zien ben ik blijkbaar altijd zat dat beweren ze toch ik drink eens een pint niet meer of minder ik moet toegeven dat ik geen normaal leven meer heb hasselt sint truiden noem maar op overal wordt er achter mijn rug gezeverd
8124748 wij constateren dat alle bemanningsleden bij terugkeer van hun opdracht systematisch klagen over hoofdpijn en over een zeer onaangenaam gevoel
8124749 de bemanningsleden schrijven hun ongemak toe aan het stralingssysteem opmerkelijk daarbij is dat de antennes werden ingebouwd door de amerikanen zonder verder onderzoek of zonder enige handleiding
8124750 zon haai weegt toch al gauw 80 kilo dus dat wil wat zeggen
8124751 ze hadden de rog ook in een hoekje gedreven en al een flinke hap uit haar poep gebeten
8124752 een heel groot vrouwtje met een staart van wel twee meter daarom zit ze niet bij de andere roggen in een aquarium maar bij de haaien en dat is vijf jaar goed gegaan
8124753 behalve nu waarschijnlijk had ze een wondje en hebben de haaien bloed geroken dan zijn ze niet meer te houden
8124754 ik kon de haaien wegjagen maar ze waren best kwaad ah ja ik had hun middagmaal afgepakt
8124755 ik heb er eentje een tik op zijn neus gegeven met mijn zwemvlies bij haaien is de neus heel gevoelig dus daar is hij van geschrokken
8124756 enrico fermi fue la primera persona que sugiri la forma en que las part culas c smicas pod an adquirir grandes velocidades

8124758 shrink it and people will flock to the city to get transit
8124759 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage
8124760 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8124761 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
8124762 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
8124763 shrink it and people will flock to the city to get transit
8124764 the consumer is also spending time on other digital formats like mobile tv and the internet
8124765 we will be the largest company providing a bollywood news and features syndication service not only to india but to the rest of the world
8124766 in the developed markets the cable and dth systems are transparent you are paid for the number of subscribers you have unlike in india where subscription income is hazy
8124767 we are currently making money from advertising but will go pay soon
8124768 it is still early days for this business in india even internally it is aligned more as a brand programme than a revenue programme of course over a period of time this will change
8124769 we need to think outside the box and need alternative channels if telecom companies are able to use grocery stores petty shops and other small outlets why not insurance companies
8124770 listening to her i thought she could be president of the united states
8124771 it was like saying goodbye to her someday id like to thank her in person
8124772 is a role model for all women they can do whatever the want to do
8124773 the algorithm that is responsible for the titles and snippets of result pages now highlights stems and some synonyms of the original query term
8124774 seems more like an attempt by zog to assassinate us
8124775 it wouldnt surprise me if these people are jews sic or dumb patsies involved in yet another false flag mossad operation in order to conjure up yet more anti gun legislation
8124776 if obama is assassinated it will be the govt doing it and well take the blame like always
8124777 real white men wouldnt have been stopped from completing their mission whatever it may be
8124778 seriously plots that are this serious dont come to the surface so easily the government law enforcement agencies may be expecting obama to win and so are getting ready to conduct a preemptive strike against wnist white nationalist organizations
8124779 sound like a bunch of wannabe small timers to me they need to make sure that obamas black ass is protected his death would bring down a s tstorm of hell upon all of us
8124780 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8124781 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8124782 woolworths believes there are opportunities to fill gaps in its existing category reach within australia and new zealand by acquiring and partnering with existing businesses with strong brands and talented motivated management teams
8124783 lion nathan and db breweries have been through the twin shocks of losing wine and beer exclusivity to the supermarkets the worst has passed and i think they realise that owning your own retail outfit isnt going to protect their margins nor are spirits alone going to be a silver bullet
8124784 to woolworths and foodstuffs the locations are everything the resource management act makes it so difficult to just set up shop these days it makes far more sense to purchase an existing business complete with locations management and buying power they both want to be in a powerful position instead of getting into a long hard slog
8124785 they have the money and need the land more than foodstuffs do foodstuffs is quite asset rich and have been buying up land with an eye to 20 years from now
8124786 progressive has haemorrhaged land through a variety of owners over the years and woolworths would like to convert more of their equity to land
8124787 these products and services have not been available in new zealand for enterprise customers before so this is a significant development for corporate organisations
8124788 a lot of large companies are now seriously looking at these systems not just to cut costs but to raise efficiencies it makes far more sense than spending billions changing and upgrading your entire software system every few years
8124789 it does not decrease waste disposal and in fact it may increase the chance of the material being disposed of should the regulation discourage existing commercial waste minimisation operators
8124790 ports of auckland is facing a very tight trading environment with lower economic activity and reduced growth in both container and break bulk volume this is expected to continue for some time
8124791 arh is committed to playing its role in achieving the right outcome for the long term benefit of new zealand
8124792 you can have trains but if you cant pay the operating subsidies to run them you might as well not have them
8124793 it is an asset class whose defining features include high expected returns high volatility political and economic risk liquidity concerns and restrictions on foreign investment
8124794 by betting on brics you are building a strategy around four countries where there is little risk return relationship brazil and russia for instance are commodity producers and thus benefit from booming commodity prices while india and china are commodity buyers
8124795 some emerging markets such as russia are still problematic for outside investors because law and property rights are not always enforced in a way that engenders much confidence that your capital will be returned
8124796 emerging markets have a tendency to turn very quickly indeed which means fund managers who try to time individual countries within an emerging markets strategy can come to grief
8124797 south korea delivered a negative return of just over 70 per cent in 1997 but if you bailed out following that you would have missed out on a positive return of 110 per cent the following year
8124798 getting into and out of individual markets because of the swing of the economic cycle is a costly exercise its better to consider an emerging market commitment as a permanent one and to be cautious when selecting it
8124799 the substance of the eminent socialist gentlemans speech is that making a profit is a sin but it is my belief that the real sin is taking a loss
8124800 it was kind of a shock while reading up on co frontman ed robertsons plane crash this weekend all four on board escaped unharmed to stumble upon a mug shot from co frontman steven pages um cocaine bust
8124801 so as you can see me and yumi chan was it are quite well acquainted
8124802 si no hay medios que nos lo digan pues estamos en una situaci n muy dif cil y nadie dice nada
8124803 el sector est cansado de lazos negros que caen en saco roto y desde 1990 ha habido unos 50 profesionales asesinados por lo que las alarmas deben saltar
8124804 ante la actual situaci n econ mica nos estamos convirtiendo en el cajero autom tico del delincuente y estamos expuestos todos los d as a que te pongan una pistola en la cabeza
8124805 ha sido una experiencia muy bonita estar en unos juegos ol mpicos representando a tu pa s es algo maravilloso hemos trabajado mucho pero ha merecido la pena
8124806 despu s del partido no es que estuvi semos tristes pero no puedo negar que nuestro objetivo era el oro
8124807 todav a no es oficial que sea a to el t cnico as que lo nico que s es que l ya no es el seleccionador
8124808 en breves fechas tendremos una confirmaci n definitiva sobre qui n ser nuestro entrenador
8124809 a to garc a reneses ha comunicado que haciendo uso de una de las cl usulas estipuladas en su contrato ha decidido desvincularse del mismo
8124810 muy contento por la oportunidad de dirigir a espa a en unos juegos ol mpicos
8124811 no quiero entrenar s lo dos meses al a o ahora mismo prefiero seguir en activo durante toda la temporada
8124812 a plena disposici n de la feb para colaborar con ella en el futuro
8124813 no s lo por el resultado sino sobre todo por el trato que he recibido y los medios que se han puesto a disposici n del equipo
8124814 es todo un honor jugar aqu cuando estaba en washington pensaba en la nba o si ten a que marcharme a europa venir a jugar a espa a al final estoy aqu en m laga en la liga mejor liga del continente
8124815 soy un jugador ambicioso por eso me gusta este reto
8124816 puedo jugar de escolta o de alero me encuentro bastante c modo en ambas posiciones incluso soy capaz de ejercer de base
8124817 the last two years have been incredibly successful for the green party
8124818 green support has risen steadily in voting intention polls of canadians and we now sit with two to three times the support received in the 2006 election we are the only federal party with momentum and if the prime minister chooses to ignore the spirit of his own fixed date election law we will be ready to go to the polls
8124819 byelections are the only electoral test between elections and our byelection record is excellent
8124820 from my second place finish in london north centre with 26 per cent to the last round of byelections where we bested conservative and ndp candidates to the present byelections in ontario and quebec where we are running strong campaigns the message is clear voters are embracing the green party as never before
8124821 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
8124822 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
8124823 there is no handicap in the practice of democracy in this country
8124824 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
8124825 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
8124826 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
8124827 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8124828 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8124829 folks always ask me whats my biggest criticism of president bush im sure you all have your own heres mine its not just the policy differences its the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources the character and resolve of the american people he never really asked us to step up
8124830 a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids no real strategy to invest in our infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats just not right thats four more years that we just cant afford
8124831 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter whether its got a d or an r next to it because this election isnt about liberal vs conservative its not about left vs right its about the future vs the past
8124832 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8124833 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8124834 we finished up in ottawa and mike had this great idea of biking across canada
8124835 its always been a part of the family and a part of dinnertime conversation
8124836 the idea is that instead of it being run for profit by some other landlord youre running it and trying to keep the rent as low as possible for the tenants all the benefits get passed on
8124837 the tenants form a board they run the place themselves they can hire a co ordinator manager if they want one but still be answerable to the community through the board that theyve elected
8124838 tienes que tener cosas en com n con la otra persona y estar enamorado
8124839 it might be appropriate to consider sending a letter from the town to the schoolboard requesting consideration be given to video and other surveillance which will help to curtail this issue
8124840 as part of technorati media well be able to grow the community and further improve our platform to attract new audiences
8124841 technoratis mission to help bloggers and people who read blogs is the ideal complement for us
8124842 la situaci n con relaci n a otros a os tira a la baja fundamentalmente por los precios aunque esperamos que mejore claro que los desplazamientos tambi n son menores
8124843 not even an inch more of land necessary for the project has been acquired we are willing to show respect to the opposition and sit for relevant discussions but not for talks that are irrelevant and illogical
8124844 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
8124845 ive made a major investment here to move will be at a great cost to tata motors and to shareholders
8124846 ratan tata has two options if he moves out of west bengal he will either retain the selling price and delay the project by six or seven months or he might sell the nano at a higher price
8124847 soy afortunada el 20 de agosto yo volv a nacer
8124848 me agarr a mi asiento y tras el golpe se me baj el est mago y se me nubl la vista por lo que me levant respir hondo y di gracias al angelito de la guarda por haber sobrevivido
8124849 simplemente hab a unos ni os que ten an unos asientos encima y los quit para que no estuvieran aplastados creo que todo el mundo acudir a en ayuda de alguien que la pide
8124850 terminar saber toda la historia y cerrar este cap tulo y seguir adelante

8124852 siento que est n llorando sus v ctimas y yo llegue caminando
8124853 if anything its just a great way for us to introduce ourselves to other artists around the maritimes and its an absolutely great way for these artists who are travelling around the maritimes to get a really good idea of whats here
8124854 what ive realized at events like this is that you can walk into pretty much anywhere that theres a showcase going on and see an amazing talented artist that you might not have had the opportunity to know through the media or elsewhere
8124855 i think if it does one thing it really shows people in these towns that there is such a huge pool of talent in nova scotia
8124856 joel plaskett could come up here anytime and do glasgow square i think what doing an event like this does is allow some of those bands who dont have that exposure to get that exposure
8124857 during the ecmas people are expecting things they know that joel plasketts going to play they know the trews are going to play
8124858 i mean if it was three years ago and people seen wintersleeps name or in flight safetys or two hours traffic joel plaskett matt mays they wouldnt have come down either
8124859 but if you look at how the music is driven in this area all these bands are definitely going to be playing bigger stages and doing bigger things
8124860 these are for people that are coming on strong in their careers at this point in time and they need the extra push
8124861 its meant to lift them up that much more and introduce them to new people the trick of it is getting four or five acts per night per venue its a chance for people to get new music in a small town where you may not see a lot of these bands ever come through
8124862 there had even been an internal memo about the railings
8124863 su potencial para promocionar este arte su tradici n y trayectoria
8124864 it was the god given instinct i just felt it
8124865 the police instinct inside me just tells you somethings just not right
8124866 theyre going to be using a nontoxic bug spray that will both hill the mosquitoes and also make it harder for them to move around
8124867 well this is an indicator citizens of new hampshire need to take precautions to prevent mosquito bites
8124868 shrink it and people will flock to the city to get transit
8124869 i believe id bring a calming effect over knox county
8124870 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8124871 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8124872 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that
8124873 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8124874 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8124875 ive always been interested in home improvement and green construction so hopefully ill learn a few things through this connection to the guys at hgtvpro
8124876 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8124877 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8124878 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8124879 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8124880 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8124881 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that just look at hillary clintons speech
8124882 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8124883 you committed a murder on monday and a murder on tuesday i wasnt about to wait around til wednesday
8124884 either the market will enforce adult supervision whereby imap technology is standardized or a huge opportunity will open up for web based email readers

8124887 i dont want to call it out yet but its in pretty good shape
8124888 all the crews have been released basically we have local crews here who will go out and check it but theres a good chance with all the rain weve had that its good to go
8124889 if we get some dry weather and high winds it could pick up again
8124890 when you sacrifice yourself for the team everything happens on cue its all about timing
8124891 the citizens are getting hit hard as well so theyre needing the nonprofit agencies more
8124892 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

8124895 everyone at nikon is especially eager to see the myriad of ways that imaginative d90 photographers will explore the world of cinematic 24fps hd video through the eyes of nikkor optics

8124898 that guys weird its like hes got two personalities inside him one day hes christian slater as a suburban dad the next hes christian slater as a globetrotting master of espionage
8124899 this is perhaps the prime reason of prevailing tensions surrounding the mandate and activities of the organisation

8124904 die betroffenen die sich bei uns gemeldet haben mussten wie fast jeder der einreist ihren computer aufmachen wenn dann festgestellt wurde dass unheimlich viel daten auf dem laptop waren dann mussten sie auch recht lange auf die r ckgabe ihres computers warten was in der zeit mit dem computer passiert ist das wei keiner
8124905 und wer einen laptop mitbringt der muss genauso wie die pers nliche visitation auch die berpr fung des laptops ber sich ergehen lassen
8124906 jedes land hat das recht zu pr fen wer einreist und wie er einreist das geht aus der souver nit t eines landes hervor und ein land kann sagen ich will genau wissen wer hier reinkommt und zum genauen wissen k nnen solche kontrollen unter umst nden dann auch geh ren

8124910 the waves were quite high with a strong enough current following the night to dawn downpour in the area

8124914 nobodys life should be threatened not even in the hyperbole of the moment beside you are rappers you have better ethics than bill oreilly does live up to them dont live down to him word to your mother
8124915 and they all get about a d minus in grammar and spelling
8124916 a lot of the conservatives reacting have us pegged as black and theyre talking about how we shouldnt get reparations
8124917 i find it frightening that a song like this can bring out that stereotypical reaction to hip hop

8124919 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8124920 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time

8124922 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said

8124924 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom

8124944 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8124945 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8124946 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8124947 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house

8124953 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
8124954 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
8124955 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
8124956 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
8124957 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
8124958 now we have to look elsewhere for this energy source
8124959 with windows mobile even though third party programs have been available from day one it was not as obvious to people
8124960 microsoft always sold them through third parties it was never right on the device it was never in activesync it was never in peoples faces like itunes is
8124961 we have users who switch platforms either because they want to themselves or because their company decides now were all going to be blackberry or not yet but we think this will happen now were all going to be iphone
8124962 microsoft by being more open which is great for us as developers is not as easy for the less technical end users
8124963 apple has trained their whole big audience to go right to itunes and now suddenly they go to itunes and theyve got this big thing in their face that says app store
8124964 the one thing that they really do nail is the user interface aspect
8124965 but from a feature standpoint theres probably nothing they have that windows mobile as well as other manufacturers havent had for years
8124966 with windows mobile weve been at this for seven years so weve definitely learned a ton in this space and thats why weve stuck with our strategy especially in the developer space
8124967 weve been growing nearly 100 percent every year outselling rim outselling apple
8124968 a developer can develop an app that works on nearly 140 different devices in the marketplace because the phones work with open standard apis
8124969 where you start to have this fragmentation how many instances of java are out there
8124970 i really doubt that an enterprise is going to go ok everybody load a music application on your pc so that we can distribute an enterprise application
8124971 with windows mobile weve been at this for seven years so weve definitely learned a ton in this space and thats why weve stuck with our strategy especially in the developer space
8124972 location based services social networking mcommerce including advertising and payments communication and entertainment
8124973 when john doerr one of the top guys at kleiner perkins announced the 100 million development fund for the iphone he made a comment in which he said the iphone is the next pc
8124974 that got a lot of us thinking that with the iphone there was a significant technology shift number one it sported a pc class operating system as well as a pc class browser and the emphasis from apple really was on extending mac os x to a mobile platform
8124975 and so in that sense were not thinking of this as just being another phone
8124976 were thinking of this as being the reincarnation of the poqet pc only from the historical perspective because back in 1990 there was an actual poqet pc introduced and it didnt fit in your pocket it was like a mini pc a cool idea but way ahead of its time but having said that apple actually is bringing to market what is in essence a full internet experience and a fairly good representation of the pc experience to a device thats in your pocket
8124977 the browser on windows mobile devices isnt a standard browser so it doesnt work with a lot of web sites
8124978 the most important thing in a mobile device right now is really being able to get at every web site that you want so if a web site doesnt recognize pocket internet explorer then thats not as useful as safari or opera mobile microsoft could integrate opera mobile with their handhelds and that would be a better experience
8124979 hopefully they realize that thats a problem and the next release of visual studio will fill that in
8124980 but again if we look at ajax and rich web as the next wave i think microsoft is going to get there were just not there right now
8124981 you just want to watch the timing on your investment because i just dont know when were going to see silverlight to my knowledge theres still not anything publicly available
8124982 were still working to get the flash player to work on the iphone
8124983 once we do that well need to work with apple to figure out terms to get it on the device
8124984 for quite some time since the iphone launched over a year ago weve had our customers solicit recommendations that we support it they were not just interested in accessing many of the salesforce apps on the iphone but also any of the 72 000 salesforce com applications that are built on our platform
8124985 my perception of the mobile market is that end users of the devices play a huge role in what it selects and we see many organizations that have multiple devices deployed as opposed to one strict standardization
8124986 so i think in the world of mobile devices its end user preference that plays a huge influence in what the it department supports a little different than lets say laptops where a company will standardize on a certain laptop or a certain type of os
8124987 if you talk about enterprise apps where the ceo checks his e mail and keeps his calendar on there youre going to see lots of that on iphones
8124988 but when it comes to hey were doing warehouse management or hey were doing tracking i think well see apple do a few high profile apps but id be shocked if they became a major player in enterprise apps in that time frame its just not their culture as much as they want to say it is
8124989 to me the thing that apple tries to do is they try to control things too much
8124990 people will talk about sql lite being a good database but sql server compact edition has true transaction support it has multiuser capability so its a real live database when it comes to developer tools when youre talking about smart clients microsoft is doing a great job when it comes to the web i think thats where we need to see them do just a little bit more
8124991 the enterprise apps for the iphone will start coming out and it will start becoming clearer
8124992 theres so much going on out there and everybody is jumping in and its a great space to be in
8124993 there were mp3 players way before the ipod but nobody made it big until apple
8124994 research in motion was looking at the pda market and thinking yes this is what it should be and then apple showed people how huge it can be we always believed it could be huge
8124995 as far as i know were the only sport that has roster limitations
8124996 i understand limiting scholarships but not walk ons as it stands we were going to have a walk on tryout on sept 22 but now we might not be able to do that i have 34 on the roster and the possibility of another player joining the team before school starts
8124997 he was a transfer who played one year and was third on our team in pitching appearances and kris steffen played with us the last two years
8124998 this year guys like that wont have a chance to make the team
8124999 thats where i wanted to go and i got a chance to play there a year and be an undergraduate coach
8125000 if they had limits there was no way i would have been welcomed as a walk on
8125001 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense said school superintendent david thweatt of the harrold independent school district
8125002 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8125003 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree said doug pennington spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence
8125004 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count mr thweatt said
8125005 they were like fish in a barrel mr thweatt said
8125006 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12 he said many eventually joined the rodeo circuit or work in the oil fields
8125007 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual
8125008 a lot of responsibility for someone who already has a lot of responsibility in the classroom
8125009 as far as we are aware this is the first policy of its kind at the elementary or high school level
8125010 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense
8125011 that was the most important thing to me its just something you dream about your whole life
8125012 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
8125013 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
8125014 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8125015 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
8125016 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8125017 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
8125018 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
8125019 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
8125020 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware
8125021 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in the global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas we need a president who understands we cant solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in the new technologies that will build a green economy

8125027 el debate est abierto y ma ana tiene que decir algo
8125028 el oso dijo es un animal muy resistente y este ejemplar com a con intensidad
8125029 me encantar a que la gente que pone lazos fuese pillada in fraganti y pagara con lo que m s duele que yo creo que no es la c rcel sino el bolsillo
8125030 p ramo es un municipio afortunado por convivir con el oso pardo es una especie que hay que cuidar y es un lujo tenerlo como vecino

8125032 stos son partidos para demostrar que uno es futbolista por lo que significa por lo que nos jugamos as que sinceramente no me preocupa demasiado la afici n rival esto es f tbol cuanto m s ambiente mejor
8125033 es una competici n en la que si pasas fenomenal y si no me cago hasta en que nadie piense que hay ni un resquicio de cosas positivas en una eliminaci n ninguna hay que pensar en seguir
8125034 no creo que ellos vayan a hacer el mismo planteamiento que aqu tampoco creo que vayan a jugar tan alegre como suelen hacerlo en su liga pero va a ser otro partido seguro
8125035 va a salir a hacer un gol r pido empujado por su p blico
8125036 el equipo tiene la madurez suficiente para encarar este tipo de partidos
8125037 con rbitros internacionales es muy dif cil que las haya
8125038 tenemos un rbitro italiano bueno y es un partido de uefa las encerronas ya se acabaron el que haya un ambiente dif cil es l gico porque cada uno utiliza sus armas pero dentro de la reglamentaci n y no hay que pensar en eso

8125052 aprobar un examen no es tanto cuesti n de capacidad como de trabajo los padres deben ser un poco cr ticos con ellos mismos y ver si durante el verano han controlado el trabajo de sus hijos
8125053 los padres deben asegurarse que sus hijos est n trabajando de cara a las recuperaciones hay que fomentar que programen cada asignatura que estudien todos los d as preguntar la lecci n
8125054 el resultado final ser el fruto del trabajo de todo el verano ah se ver el esfuerzo del estudiante pero tambi n la implicaci n de la familia
8125055 no se puede mirar hacia otro lado y luego exigir resultados ni planificar unas grandes vacaciones y esperar que despu s el ni o estudie en lugar de disfrutar
8125056 los alumnos deben entender que superar estas asignaturas son un reto necesario para acceder a aquella profesi n que quieran desempe ar de mayores
8125057 tambi n se les puede motivar con alg n regalo pero no material sino la posibilidad de realizar alguna actividad o curso que le interese siempre que consigan aprobar las pendientes
8125058 lo ideal es que estudien unas dos horas diarias y lo hagan desde que termine el curso para no perder el h bito sin embargo las vacaciones son para disfrutar no se puede exigir el mismo nivel de dedicaci n que durante el curso porque si no el joven no habr descansado y sus resultados en el siguiente a o acad mico ser n tambi n negativos
8125059 si no hemos memorizado la materia en dos meses no lo haremos en tres d as

8125083 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the what is the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8125084 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8125085 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8125086 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8125087 no recibir gol en la ida nos da una peque a ventaja
8125088 the classic itself because of the sponsorship from the various corporations will probably raise in terms of net profit about 100 000
8125089 those dollars will go to scholarship support as well as athletic department support
8125090 our private funding for the university as a whole has grown from 2001 when we were raising roughly 600 000 to now we are raising 4 1 million
8125091 football serves as a magnet for some people who may not otherwise consider higher education
8125092 our job once we get them here is to turn them on to the possibilities of what that education can do for them
8125093 so football helps us in that sense because we take the school to them

8125163 la suora era in un centro pastorale nel distretto di kandhamal quando stata aggredita e picchiata
8125164 around 4 30 p m i hear the people screaming screaming and screaming call the police i see the body fell down from 12th floor
8125165 we were on the platform going down were thinking its like wood or some metal but we come down and we saw the guy on the floor
8125166 est fuera de rbita y sus palabras no tienen inter s alguno cuando una persona no tiene conocimiento directo de una cosa no puede opinar con esa ligereza adem s el gallego se habla mucho m s que el catal n
8125167 la real academia galega deb a estar ya mandando una carta a steine no rega ndolo sino para informarlo de los valores de nuestra cultura y de nuestra literatura
8125168 tambi n el presidente de la xunta deb a aprovechar su notoriedad para invitar a venir a galicia
8125169 yo por mi parte le enviar un informe sobre la realidad cultural de galicia
8125170 no hay que dejarse llevar por la c lera es uno de los grandes intelectuales de nuestro tiempo y hay que darle informaci n
8125171 fue un desliz no malintencionado con informaci n malintencionada tiene malos informantes es falso lo que le hacen decir
8125172 en ninguna de las tres universidades de galicia est obligado en gallego como nica lengua y dudo de que su empleo llegue al 50
8125173 denota que desconoce los cancioneros de la poes a medieval que son una joya de la literatura universal
8125174 parece propio de una operaci n para crear un enfrentamiento ideol gico
8125175 la observaci n l cida con la estupidez dejando caer una opini n con gran insolencia porque s sin argumentar
8125176 hay que ser cr ticos y distinguir el grano de la paja
8125177 es la observaci n de una persona que no sabe de lo que habla desconoce la literatura medieval e ignora las cantigas y habla de un pa s que no es el suyo con un prejuicio xen fobo al considerar que una lengua es inferior a otra
8125178 es un desliz de una persona que sabe mucho pero no de todo
8125179 si hay un idioma recuperado o inventado no es el gallego ni el catal n sino el hebreo
8125180 steiner es un genio un tipo de intelectual importante pero eso no es una garant a absoluta todos los genios tienen alg n lunar
8125181 galicia vista desde las alturas de par s londres o los ngeles parece poca cosa
8125182 hay documentaci n incluso que est adem s en ingl s no s cu l es el problema y si se trata de la tradici n literaria el gallego tiene una extraordinaria literatura medieval que no se puede echar por la borda
8125183 steiner da a entender que no sabe mucho de las diferentes literaturas que hay en este pa s tiene el t pico prejuicio europeo que se encarg pujol de propagar y ahora erc de que el catal n es el idioma del liceo y el gallego el de unos b rbaros aislados su modelo de alta cultura se fundamenta en la cantidad de tradici n que una lengua acumula no en la calidad de esa tradici n por supuesto la baja cultura ni la considera es un tipo de pensamiento muy superado que no me interesa
8125184 creo que no hay que exigir tanto nivel en los diferentes idiomas auton micos para ejercer trabajos en puestos p blicos porque restan oportunidades a personas muy competentes no veo justo que un tipo de albacete tenga que hacer un examen de gallego para ser profesor de matem ticas en a coru a ya que en justa correspondencia a un tipo gallego deber an hacerle un examen de espa ol si va a dar clase de matem ticas a albacete y a lo mejor tampoco lo aprueba veo una asimetr a que resta oportunidades a los que han nacido en una regi n con un solo idioma no me parece justo m s bien un disparate

8125186 it was already mission impossible before and now it will be even more difficult
8125187 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8125188 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8125189 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8125190 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8125191 now the west cant look away anymore and georgias point of view is becoming difficult to ignore its way too early to make long term predictions but it could positively influence nato and the eu towards georgia

8125400 tassal is well positioned to benefit from the investments made in 2008
8125401 tassal is experiencing strong earnings momentum and expects to achieve an underlying net profit after tax of 30 million for fiscal 2009 in line with its previous guidance
8125402 our balance sheet is strong with low gearing which will allow tassal to aggressively pursue both organic and acquisitive growth
8125403 while i am very pleased with the 2008 result against a background of financial turmoil and economic uncertainty the year should be viewed as a period of transition in the history of premier a year which has provided the platform for future growth
8125404 we have also successfully positioned the company to benefit from the full ownership of a business with a substantial presence in the australian retail sector
8125405 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8125406 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8125407 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8125408 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8125409 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8125410 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8125411 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8125412 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8125413 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8125414 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8125415 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco
8125416 iniziato in italia in ritardo rispetto agli altri paesi europei
8125417 manca un sistema informatico adeguato sia per la rilevazione dei prezzi sia per garantire la tracciabilit dei prodotti

8125461 the many worlds of jonas moore is an exciting digital graphic novel thats creating quite a sensation abroad
8125462 we see this as a great concept that will make an exciting series for worldwide audiences
8125463 mgm is a great place for the many worlds of jonas moore
8125464 there has never been a black british action hero before and what appealed to me was that mgm understood this from the outset jonas moore is sophisticated educated tough and uber cool he represents the next generation of intelligent action heroes of international sci fi drama

8125466 forever 21 development on south central farm site is protested
8125467 as the uk it sector continues to specialise increasingly in more high end technical work and more entry level jobs are outsourced overseas there are fewer opportunities for graduates and others with less experience to get a foot on the first rung of the career ladder
8125468 the knock on effect is that higher up that ladder where there is demand for skilled and experienced workers there is not enough supply coming through the ranks making recruitment and retention more difficult and driving up salaries as a result
8125469 what we have actually seen is a number of clients have done the reverse and have instigated rate cuts and not just within the financial sector although this is the most obvious area
8125470 there is always demand for standard development tools based around net technologies c java j2ee but there is nothing out there that has demanded a premium on the market at this stage
8125471 there are police searches everywhere it is a mountainous area full of trees
8125472 negotiations are underway involving influential local people there has been no threat to his life

8125491 extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
8125492 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8125493 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8125494 were not asking for the world i stop at 7 000 if i would get that i would be happy but did you guys experience any of that did you have to walk through your fellow citizens raw sewage this is absolutely insane
8125495 as residents of oshkosh if you had four five six inches of raw sewage in your basement isnt that uncalled for something is wrong with the sewer system get it fixed
8125496 based on the expert which is our insurance carrier rep himself the fact of the matter is youre out of luck
8125497 from 2002 to 2007 we actually had accepted 22 claims paid them off so there is a history
8125498 but a quarter of them actually we do pay off on but it depends on the circumstances if its something thats demonstrated we have done something negligent then we certainly look to pay those types of claims
8125499 the d90 delivers incredible imaging performance and control setting a new standard for its class this marriage of outstanding still image performance and hd movie clip capacity represents the dawn of a new age for d slr cameras the d90s handling characteristics and long list of features are sure to deliver the photographic experience that nikon photographers have come to expect from nikon engineering
8125500 everyone at nikon is especially eager to see the myriad of ways that imaginative d90 photographers will explore the world of cinematic 24fps hd video through the eyes of nikkor optics
8125501 we rode that wave in radio really well he said
8125502 this year the august month was clearly impacted by the olympics we expected that
8125503 but over that national advertising is certainly softer tighter more cautious than it was 12 months ago
8125504 relatively well and flagged cost cuts to adapt to the tougher environment
8125505 theres not a significant benefit in terms of a platform we can offer to national advertisers if were at three rather than five mr dorney said
8125506 its real sobering for me to be a part of a second school system that has had to deal with such fiscal crisis
8125507 i wish i were not going through it a second time but yet at the same time that was the foundation for me in understanding what needed to be done in an effort to turn the situation around
8125508 i wouldnt wish this on any school i wouldnt wish this on any community
8125509 this is my neighborhood and im not going to let anyone else like that claim the neighborhood theyre not going to
8125510 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner paula wagner and united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of 11 million
8125511 we dont want to hide anything and i dont think we want anything to be hidden
8125512 it was already mission impossible before and now it will be even more difficult
8125513 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8125514 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8125515 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8125516 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating
8125517 if you are facing uncertain global economic times ahead the worst thing you can do is send a message of uncertainty to the international economic and financial community about whether this governments budget is going to pass the parliament and whether its surplus is going to remain intact
8125518 seeking to undermine the governments efforts to assist the reserve bank in the struggle to keep interest rates as low as possible
8125519 i do not really know any more who takes the decisions over on their side of the house
8125520 were not going to block the budget its not a 1975 situation with the whitlam government
8125521 is it constitutionally adequate in light of all the relevant circumstances yes
8125522 we think the city is putting logistics above the first amendment
8125523 there will be times when the present public viewing area will be crowded and the plaintiffs in this lawsuit as well as others will be frustrated
8125524 there are so many individuals and groups that want to be heard on public issues that that would be inevitable even if a larger area were possible
8125525 there were legitimate security safety and transportation reasons why that needed to happen some of which involved access for emergency vehicles to get to the
8125526 this is going to be a very broad inclusive demonstration
8125527 we just really want to encourage people to come out
8125528 so that people who dont want to risk arrest will still feel comfortable safe
8125529 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8125530 i wish to report that andrew jaspan will no longer be editor in chief
8125531 i will come and bid my adieu on the floor at 12noon
8125532 there will be reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial to ensure optimal employment of staff and technology and including outsourcing of elements that will not impact our quality position
8125533 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
8125534 you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position had declined
8125535 he has our thanks and appreciation for all he has achieved in the past four years
8125536 discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8125537 he was almost done he was ready to get out
8125538 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8125539 woodside expects stronger production in 2h 2008 with contributions from enfield re drills additional nwsv oil equity plus new production from vincent angel nws train 5 neptune and power play
8125540 consequently woodside is on track to achieve its 2008 production target of 80 to 86 mmboe
8125541 first half production has increased by 4 and revenues by 45 over the same period in 2007
8125542 at the date of this report the pluto project is approximately 25 complete
8125543 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage
8125544 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8125545 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8125546 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8125547 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8125548 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8125549 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8125550 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8125551 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8125552 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8125553 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8125554 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage
8125555 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8125556 the next thing i knew there was a loud explosion and black smoke
8125557 why do they insist on flying over other peoples property
8125558 they could fly over the ocean and be no risk to anyone but themselves
8125559 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8125560 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8125561 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8125562 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8125563 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8125564 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8125565 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8125566 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8125567 when the going gets tough put the spotlight on someone else to cover up your own bad performance
8125568 we had an agreement to have a somewhat open relationship and actually being involved in a game online was a very safe way to do that
8125569 the fixtures on the walls were banging around it was really a very major event as far as i was concerned
8125570 my concern is what happens with the low frequency component of the emission
8125571 its the stability of the bank our foundation the amount of shaking thats happening is going to affect the structure somewhere
8125572 we have recently installed an engine exhaust silencer on the coastal celebration and it seems to have helped with that issue
8125573 so we will be installing the product on the other two vessels
8125574 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first
8125575 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8125576 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8125577 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8125578 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8125579 when we created chiltern early phase our vision was to develop a brand that would be synonymous with quality and service excellence we now have the team organization and facilities to deliver on this vision and provide a truly expert early phase service at reasonable cost
8125580 i am delighted to see the integration completed so thoroughly and ahead of schedule we are now looking to build on our units long histories of good science and medicine both in the areas where we have traditionally been strong but also in new areas of specialization such as diabetes and cardiovascular medicine we are also looking forward to forging academic links to provide specialist studies involving new biomarkers
8125581 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk
8125582 keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8125583 while the other profiles would be nice having headset support was essential
8125584 that means android wont be one flavor it will be many making it more difficult for software developers to write code once and run it everywhere
8125585 the whole notion of how secure the phone will be is also important
8125586 consumers are also enterprise users these days so if youre building a high end feature phone you better be able to make it fit into an enterprise environment
8125587 remember a while back that apple didnt actually open up the iphone to developers during the first year
8125588 the phones got to work as a phone first because if it breaks or is unreliable then you might not get a second chance
8125589 everything hinges on the finished product with googles android nothing that apple did on the iphone mattered until people could buy the phone
8125590 the original application that kind of launched this whole business was simply location tracking and it was just being aware of where the vehicles were and avoiding theft
8125591 that was the big selling point but as the technologies progressed theres a lot more information coming back
8125592 drivers are notoriously unreliable at reporting when warning lights are come on now the fleet manager gets instant notification real time to check if the engine lights come on or low break warning lights come on
8125593 this sort of information can be used to counsel the drivers when they get back
8125594 some do a red yellow green scoring system that gives the fleet managers something that can work with the drivers and if the driving record doesnt improve they can actually get rid of the unsafe drivers which can help them with insurance premiums and can save on repair costs
8125595 i dont see a huge trend in ontario with this type of activity which is unfortunate because i think its a great way to use wireless technology
8125596 for the time being cdma vendors exposed to north america are going to take a hit
8125597 claro cambia su pol tica acerca del iphone ahora es tuyo al terminar el contrato
8125598 we want to increase the number of games on hd and we want to increase the number of games being televised overall
8125599 both teams will go home at night and sleep better now and umpires will go home at night and sleep better ive seen so many home runs taken away over the years that affect a games outcome its not to call anybody out but if you can get the call right get the call right
8125600 when you are chasing that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow its hard to find said sjsu receiver kevin jurovich a close friend of schweigers since high school
8125601 hes open about his faith and thats where hes found his love and sense of belonging and hes totally happy now you can see it in the smile on his face contentment and fulfillment
8125602 when i was real young id lay on my bed and think about my future and i was like i want beautiful women i want money i want fame
8125603 my freshman year i felt like i had it but it still didnt make me happy
8125604 my life depended on football so much that when it was gone even the chance of not being able to have it paralyzed me with fear schweiger said
8125605 so i started to do crazy stuff the drinking and drugs and girls were an escape because i just wanted to be free from the pain when id do that stuff id be free for a minute but when i was done the pain came back twofold every time
8125606 i found that i was playing football for acceptance and fame and was motivated by fear
8125607 he was in that frame of mind for a couple of months jeff schweiger sr
8125608 i tell them i hit you as hard as i love you if i hit you soft you know i dont care he said laughing
8125609 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8125610 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8125611 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8125612 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8125613 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped
8125614 i promise you if you ask the russians they will give you a long litany of things where they think they have cooperated with us and we havent given much in return
8125615 but dont go too far cause its low on vaseline
8125616 lets all go into the living room and sit down and the first person who says a word has to do the dishes
8125617 jane your beans were delicious as usual but what did you put in them this time

8125620 do democrats really think so little of their fellow americans
8125621 a verbal contract isnt worth the paper its printed on
8125622 round the clock transmission a mix of live and recorded events from the olympic games was a first for the region
8125623 and reports indicate island audiences were thrilled at the chance to see their competitors in the opening ceremony and participating in their chosen sports most stations broadcast hour after hour of games coverage and some got caught up with the beijing magic and remained on air way past their usual close down times
8125624 corporate partners to promote new products connect with influential government officials cabinet president next president

8125636 we think that there are employers that have been really flexible this week
8125637 caterpillars operations have benefited from chinas remarkable economic growth and we are proud to be a part of this historical transformation
8125638 we look forward to making an even bigger contribution to the economy and people of this country
8125639 this is an important milestone in support of caterpillars growth in china
8125640 we are committed to bringing the best products and services to our customers in the region
8125641 this investment demonstrates caterpillars long term commitment to china to our customers and our employees
8125642 we expect to triple sems capacity once the new facility is operational
8125643 caterpillar has a long history in china and we look forward to a prosperous future
8125644 we will continue to look for ways to contribute to the communities where we all work and live
8125645 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement it is time for dr levitt and his family to live up to the contract and do what is required of them under the option agreement
8125646 these shareholders benefited from suns investment which basically saved taro from collapse
8125647 means until the process completes they really cant do anything
8125648 everyone has a different work style and this really addresses the different scenarios where people want to create an outlook folder or a hierarchy based on client matter or projects and files e mails into it
8125649 that has become a key productivity tool for lawyers at this point they need to know that they have complete access to those documents for the 30 days that it would naturally stay on their blackberries
8125650 we were at 100 per cent growth on a yearly basis
8125651 we had to find a way to deal with the constant growth and when it came to managing that it infrastructure we had the same team and resources to work with from one year to the next
8125652 what they needed was something that would do a more efficient job of utilizing what they already had
8125653 canada is definitely lagging the united states particularly in comparison to server virtualization which is more on par many advanced storage solutions have sputtered in canada adoption such as tiered and hierarchal storage provisioning and information lifecycle management the uptakes just not there
8125654 it can thus be hard to articulate the value of it
8125655 as a central agency for the government we dont have the governance in place to put a policy on our department but the individual departments can try and put due diligence around their own data
8125656 it makes things more manageable when youre adding servers and storage to the data centre it can often be difficult getting them working together
8125657 the amount of budget money hasnt increased but the data has so a big benefit is being able to grow without having to hire additional support staff as a government agency we really have to consolidate and make better use of everything
8125658 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable

8125660 sen obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8125661 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8125662 do you think you know rock amp pop electronica hip hop metal or indie music
8125663 if what i was doing is directly affecting morale or that i cause the morale problem id see that
8125664 i didnt tarnish the reputation st pete had st pete did that itself
8125665 when i first came here i heard st pete pd was the place to go
8125666 officer kokotek is an experienced officer who maintains a calm professional manner when dealing with both the public and his peers
8125667 my idea was lets put some faces and names on these decisions and what the police administration is doing in the background
8125668 i was trying to bring attention to the problems going on in the department
8125669 i would see these decisions and this would be my response to it either you get mad or you laugh at it and do a little satire
8125670 harmons eyes could shift and his ears puff out those are things people noticed about him
8125671 i do draw i do work with photos and do arts things that was my way of expressing myself
8125672 i thought i had a first amendment right to speak out on a site where i stayed anonymous
8125673 creating or posting cartoons drawings or caricatures which denigrate or make light of any individual or group based on race gender sexual orientation
8125674 i cant have police officers in the department doing things like that that show an aversion to any group or sexual orientation or race or anything
8125675 i think there was a lot of undertone in all of the pictures
8125676 if he were a private citizen id protect his right all day long
8125677 but he wasnt he was a city employee and they are held to a different standard
8125678 i was trying to use satire to lampoon issues on the st pete police department if im putting up a picture of someone acting like a witch shes probably acting like a witch
8125679 even in the academy kokotek was drawing pictures of all of us this isnt something new
8125680 we used to joke a lot at the department these were psychological ways for us to deal with high stress situations we laughed at ourselves thats what kept our sanity
8125681 if we dont have people like picasso or other people who are chastising the department and making people accountable for their decisions there will never be any changes and staff will be able to run amok
8125682 to me its a warning to everyone else out there dont criticize or well do the same thing to you as kokotek
8125683 we cant do our work without the help of the students

8125687 every week we invite an artist or a band to play in the streets in a bar a park or even in a flat or in an elevator and we film the whole session
8125688 of course what makes the beauty of it is all the little incidents hesitations and crazy stuff happening unexpectingly besides we do not edit the videos so they look perfectly flawless instead we keep the raw sound of the surroundings our goal is to try and capture instants film the music just like it happens without preparation without tricks spontaneity is the keyword
8125689 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
8125690 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
8125691 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
8125692 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
8125693 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8125694 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
8125695 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
8125696 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

8125700 the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8125701 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8125702 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8125703 there are reports that four to five people have been killed in fresh violence the deaths are from yesterdays violence there is no fresh violence we have also clamped a curfew in kandhamal district to avoid any violence
8125704 saying naxals are behind the attack is totally misleading and orchestrated this is an attack by the agents of christian missionaries whose attempts at forcible conversions the swamiji countered
8125705 they tried and failed for seven times the eighth time they have succeeded a week before he was killed he had received an anonymous threat that said he would soon be killed though he lodged a formal complaint the officials did not do anything about it
8125706 the administration failed to ensure that the churches and christian institutions were attacked in return so this might be an act of revenge for that given the fact that lakshmanananda was actively combating forcible conversions in the region
8125707 they were very quick to do it probably because they wanted to ensure that communal violence does not break out but eventually they werent able to do that also
8125708 there is nothing that suggests that maosits may be involved though it is soon to say for sure they are not involved there have not been many incidents where they have attacked civilians even in such a case they would have killed the two home guards who were said to have been on duty at the time of attack
8125709 the 2 3 per cent christians in the indian population cater to 20 per cent of all primary education in india 10 per cent of all the literacy and community health care 25 per cent of all existing care of destitutes and orphans 30 per cent of all the handicapped lepers and aids patients etc

8125711 we dont have numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
8125712 because of the slow growth rate of agave it is especially sensitive to the boom and bust agricultural cycle only played out in a slightly longer cycle
8125713 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
8125714 this would principally affect low quality tequila which will be altered so that it contains a lower percentage of agave
8125715 if people get more money for other crops they will stop growing agave and the price will rise its basic economics
8125716 produce agency records concerning documentation revealing the process by which wreckage recovered by defendant from the aircraft used during the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 was positively identified by defendant with the aid of the national transportation safety board as belonging to the said aircraft presumably through the use of unique serial number identifying information contained by the said aircraft wreckage that was collected by defendant and which defendant has improperly withheld from plaintiff

8125723 to date no one has requested a meeting with the dean to talk about these issues
8125724 mr wilson is not a role model for what we should teach students about the struggle for democracy in south asia
8125725 it is also hard to imagine that any credible scholar of pakistan could be recruited to fill a chair named after mr wilson

8125730 we wrote the white paper to offer additional guidance for understanding the aberdeen report on event driven manufacturing intelligence as we parsed the data ourselves we found some interesting insights that didn at us on the first read specifically we found that ready access to actionable real time data is a key driver of best in class business performance
8125731 is what best in class manufacturers do that is different from the other groups we now have clear answers to this question

8125737 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8125738 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8125739 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8125740 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8125741 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8125742 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8125743 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8125744 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers

8125752 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8125753 they have been urging us to recognize them for years now so there was a remarkable patience on display from the russian federation
8125754 it has no impact on the internationally established borders of georgia and will not change in any way the international communitys stand on the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia
8125755 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8125756 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8125757 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8125758 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed onto
8125759 cyber operations require global and theater integration across all domains
8125760 its obviously something we view with great concern its in violation of commitments theyve made in the six party framework and its clearly a step backward
8125761 and well be having discussions with our other partners in the six party talk to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8125762 now we know what russians really wanted now it is clear that it is not about abkhazia and south ossetia it is about georgia and russia know we know it is about russian imperialism now we know that it is about russias ambitions so i think that it is high time for the west to understand that this is not about only georgias job but it is largely should be the concern of the west because it is a war of values
8125763 we need help from the whole world president medvedev must not decide about independence of ossetia and abkhazia
8125764 the only place these people want to be is home and they cannot go home because of what has happened to them and because the situation that the russians have caused our goal as humanitarians is to do the best we can to give them a solid life with food clothing and self esteem until we can get them back into their homes
8125765 most of the returns since friday have been spontaneous many of the displaced returned from areas in and around tblisi
8125766 according to the georgian government between 10 and 15 000 have already gone back to gori out of an initial population estimated at somewhere around 70 000 most of the returnees had been in contact with neighbors and relatives and were aware of the state of their homes and what they were going back to many of the returnees were men who said they first want to see the situation for themselves before bringing their families back
8125767 in fact in one half hour period as we were driving out of south ossetia we counted some 100 trucks commercial trucks coming south carrying what we assume was relief assistance so there is an enormous amount of material coming from the russian federation into south ossetia but as far as i know nothing coming from georgia proper into south ossetia
8125768 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8125769 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8125770 well probably the nature and scope of access that the us is asking for probably something that is difficult to grant
8125771 yeah theyre certainly not pleased about it but that turns to the question of leverage what can they actually do they can provide some pressure but there are limits to that and north korea is not simply going to do what china tells it to do
8125772 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8125773 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8125774 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8125775 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8125776 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8125777 the primary aim of south ossetia is unification with north ossetia within the composition of russia we have never made any secret of this
8125778 todays developments may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8125779 ongoing efforts to find a common solution on the way forward in the crisis in georgia within the security council may be complicated
8125780 make their best efforts to contain further outbreaks of lawlessness which could contribute to additional displacement
8125781 have been spontaneous with many of the displaced returning from areas in and around the georgian capital tbilisi

8125803 saya memang bukan manusia tapi tetap bisa menjadi teman yang bisa diandalkan
8125804 benar luna r one adalah android tipe sahabat di masa depan dia akan menjadi robot yang sangat berguna sebagai pengasuh atau teman bagi orang orang yang hidup seorang diri luna sendiri diprogram memiliki berbagai kemampuan yang bisa dikembangkan sejalan dengan interaksinya dengan lingkungan sekelilingnya
8125805 rangga ini anak yang pendiam kurang bisa bergaul dengan baik jadi temannya tidak banyak
8125806 kemarin tanaka sudah memasukkan semua data soal rangga ke dalam memorimu kelak tolong di perhatikan soal data data itu agar bisa lebih mudah membantunya
8125807 its connected to the internet the second brain is parallel with the first brain in her body so they both can cooperated each other to make the best of her cognitive function
8125808 luna has to go for charging if this colour appears
8125809 she will stop functioning not death but looks like she is sleeping and no body can awake her until she is charging with his machine
8125810 the members of the security council stress that the successful implementation of the comprehensive ceasefire agreement constitutes a critical step that will help burundis partners accelerate their support for peacebuilding and development in burundi
8125811 in laying the foundations for long term development in burundi and in mobilizing the resources needed to consolidate peace and security including for the coming elections scheduled for 2010
8125812 replacing russian peacekeepers in the security zone with osce forces
8125813 later supported by the georgian side the abkhaz side and the south ossetian side
8125814 before the georgians can do anything else theyve first got to get the russians out
8125815 ready to accept any decision up to a complete break in relations
8125816 we are working to create an organization that can best adapt itself to working with the interagency with our international partners and even with the private public sector
8125817 and we want to do it in a way that is completely supportive of all our partners
8125818 if i would put one word on it its partnership
8125819 that is our southcom motto partnership for the americas and our objective is to become the best possible international interagency partner we can be
8125820 i think you in many ways represent the face of the future with respect to our combatant commands
8125821 you may be leading what we are doing in our government
8125822 the united states needs organizing structures that are custom made for the age we live in not where we have come from
8125823 we in the federal government need to be organized so we can build and put together solutions to 21st century security challenges because they are not the same challenges we had in the 20th century
8125824 previous southcom commanders have recognized we need to fundamentally change how we do business around here
8125825 our philosophy from the beginning was to say this is about rethinking southcom and rethinking what a combatant command is
8125826 so we are first cousins with africom no doubt about it
8125827 the end state we and africom are aiming for is really the same end state philosophically
8125828 our staffs are talking constantly and we are indeed sharing lessons back and forth
8125829 we are trying to do some very similar things and it all goes back to partnership
8125830 we have the same end state but our paths to get there are very different
8125831 africom was a top down initiative that started with a presidential directive ours was a grassroots bottom up effort it started down here where we did some things internally studied it then ultimately the commander took it forward
8125832 africom has an initiation challenge and we have a transformation challenge
8125833 i wont say that one is easier or harder than the other they are just different
8125834 you need to have all these folks working together and cooperating you have to build a coalition of the willing
8125835 and thats the way they work today it is truly remarkable
8125836 our focus has broadened to maintaining security building and increasing stability and setting the conditions for prosperity in the region
8125837 were in the refinement phase right now and will call our provisional reorganization complete by the end of the fiscal year
8125838 yes we believe the new structures will better enable us to work together in new ways to address the security challenges we have
8125839 my job is to try to build an organization that is appropriate for the world to the south
8125840 i think we have done that and i think we will continue to work very hard doing that and ill let others draw appropriate lessons
8125841 we are working very hard to make sure we answer everyones questions and do everything within the boundaries of policy and law and do it with full transparency
8125842 the bottom line is that what we are doing here makes sense
8125843 we want to be a shaper of ideas helping build partnerships between actors that dont traditionally work together all focused on a common purpose

8125862 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8125863 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8125864 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8125865 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8125866 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8125867 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8125868 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8125869 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8125870 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8125871 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8125872 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8125873 when the going gets tough put the spotlight on someone else to cover up your own bad performance
8125874 obviously that is having an impact on what is going on with the market hardly doing anything mr chatterton said from brisbane
8125875 we are hardly going to have any big movers out there
8125876 a fair bit of that has already been accounted into the market he said
8125877 that is just a normal day these days he said
8125878 the volatility we are getting at the moment 1 per cent is a fairly modest day
8125879 of course my urine tested positive what do you think they make steroids from
8125880 i am the toughest because i was in the terminator
8125881 the federal government has just shrugged its shoulders and said well fix it one of these days but really theyve done nothing
8125882 it would require proof of legal presence theyd either have to be a u s citizen or be in our country legally
8125883 its impossible i cant see how the citizens of this country in 2008 would think that would help the immigration crunch that we are all facing
8125884 i love you wait til my work is stable amp we shall be together
8125885 i love you wait til my work is stable amp we shall be together
8125886 we dont want you to use these resorts for weekends only week long periods
8125887 the cumulative numbers arent staggering and he has never won 20 games a cy young award or a ring but his won loss percentage is impressive and hes climbing the strikeout rankings
8125888 one more good season however and hell be bert blyleven with almost 100 fewer losses
8125889 if you take a snapshot of then and a snapshot of now its quite a difference
8125890 i was unsure what 08 was going to be like was i going to be a starter are they going to ask me to pitch in relief am i going to be on the team all year they were questions ive never had to ask myself i was hoping to be important to the club
8125891 baseball is a funny game and theres stuff you cant control
8125892 im about six or seven outs away from two perfect games a 20 win season and a world series ring i was three outs away from winning a world series in 2001 with mariano rivera on the mound what more can i ask for
8125893 to be able to get 20 wins at 39 its remarkable
8125894 im hoping he gets 22 or 23 we need the wins hes been our most successful pitcher his season is of the utmost importance to us
8125895 its going quickly were rolling into september when you are winning it always moves along
8125896 it was one of the toughest things i had to do as a manager
8125897 a lot of players play through stuff they shouldnt play through
8125898 he came into spring training with the mind set that he had to earn a rotation job
8125899 our mind set was that if he was healthy he was going to be able to pitch
8125900 hes commanding all quadrants of the strike zone hes changing speeds and he can fix mechanical flaws on the fly how many guys can lose 5 to 8 mph off their fastball and have a chance to win 20 games at age 39 it doesnt happen by luck
8125901 i want to keep batters in the box flat footed
8125902 his changeup has added a different realm of how slow hes able to throw his pinpoint control with his breaking ball is exceptional hes improved his repertoire
8125903 to me it was his best highlight with the yankees for the time that i was there
8125904 i dont see how that makes me a better pitcher
8125905 the total would be higher but the way i got there wouldnt be special
8125906 it is 10 minutes if i have to wait at a stop sign
8125907 this job the places we go can be fast paced
8125908 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8125909 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
8125910 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
8125911 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
8125912 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time
8125913 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8125914 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8125915 give money to someone and be confident it will end up in a college savings plan
8125916 it also allows parents to attach a plan and let people in their social network know theyd be happy to receive contributions to it
8125917 she can redeem it by telling the site to deposit it into her 529 plan thats the only way the money can come out
8125918 i can look them up and give to their plan directly specifying its for her birthday or some other occasion
8125919 democrats should be the last people on earth to ever bring up health care for children because they are 100 for aborting 1 2 million american babies every year an aborted baby is not a healthy baby
8125920 he who shall introduce into public affairs the principles of primitive christianity will change the face of the world
8125921 what to make of michelle obamas use of the terms the world as it is and the world as it should be
8125922 try chapter 2 of saul alinksys book rules for radicals
8125923 in last nights speech michelle obama said something that piqued my curiosity
8125924 she said barack stood up that day talking about a visit to chicago neighborhoods and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
8125925 and all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8125926 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position in fact they are passive but real allies of the haves the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wished for fantasy of the world as it should be
8125927 after college obama moved to chicago to be part of the jerry kellman organization as a community organizer among the primary goals of alinsky was radical socialism and redistribution of wealth alinsky taught his proteges to hide their true goals by any means necessary lying was fine the objective of alinsky and kellman was to turn people against the white establishment
8125928 we share the same common goal as the iraqi government and that is to turn over more and more of the security responsibilities to the iraqi security forces
8125929 thats proceeding well but at the end of the day nothing changes from the fact that we believe strongly that the withdrawal of u s forces of coalition forces ought to be based on the conditions on the ground and what we are seeing is a dramatically improved situation in iraq with respect to security and an ever increasingly capable iraqi security force
8125930 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8125931 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8125932 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8125933 a high alert has been sounded in the jammu due to the infiltration of three terrorists from across the international border security forces have launched a massive search operation in the entire area
8125934 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8125935 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8125936 i spoke to her and we exchanged numbers it was really emotional i can only ask people to pray for her because there is a lot of power in prayers
8125937 a high alert has been sounded in the jammu due to the infiltration of three terrorists from across the international border security forces have launched a massive search operation in the entire area
8125938 by far this is our most extreme dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date the legend of gilles de rais has been given fresh vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk swathed in pitch black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of cradle history screw what our detractors say everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram bejewelled floor
8125939 its a bit of a blow but i think people are making more of a kid whos 20 years of age and has played 19 games
8125940 hes been around for so long and hes given his all to this club and for him to not be playing for the rest of the year is really disappointing for the guys
8125941 but having said that weve managed without him all year so well keep going with that
8125942 theyre using it at a scale that it wasnt designed for
8125943 microsoft in particular started working on a much smaller improvement to the last version of the standard
8125944 i think you could characterize 3 1 as a maintenance release
8125945 wasnt to be the big scary fourth edition that microsoft and others objected to
8125946 have been deemed unsound for the web and are off the table for good packages namespaces and early binding
8125947 i think a secure ecmascript will be based on some future revision of ecmascript
8125948 agerandet bara f rv rrar det sp nda l get
8125949 to politicize this as a way to come against burgess and leaving this building as an eyesore is reprehensible
8125950 it will be very nice because there it will be very easy to stay inside because its inside the hospital
8125951 for the last couple of years it has been almost every night
8125952 our goal would be to maintain everything that it is possible to maintain
8125953 that was always my thought did he have a church was he really a reverend
8125954 i understand the lawyer in mr roddeys suit has quit the case
8125955 i think mr roddey may have a huge problem if his lawsuit is indeed dead in the water
8125956 councilman mcculloughs actions have gone from strange to bizarre in the last few weeks
8125957 but im not going to talk about it beyond what ive said in my prepared statement
8125958 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8125959 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8125960 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8125961 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8125962 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8125963 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8125964 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8125965 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8125966 and what appears to be overlooked is the fact that the actor was still very combative at the hospital and it took eight staff members to restrain him his coma was not the direct result of being hit with the taser
8125967 he was in a seizure in my living room i didnt want the cops in my house if he wasnt having a seizure i could have handled it myself
8125968 there have been questions raised about whether tasers are being used in the way they are intended
8125969 physical affirmative actions which attempt to prevent an officers control but never attempts to harm the officer
8125970 spit a wad of fluffy like material from his mouth
8125971 im sorry for shooting the girl and it was an accident
8125972 puppies from mills are not very socialized because theyve not had much human contact theyre snappy theyre not friendly theyre scared to death of everything
8125973 some pittsburgh shelters have called me and we have several pittsburgh adopters
8125974 ive already been contacted by a couple people in pittsburgh who are interested in adopting one of these dogs
8125975 because of past complaints that this was a puppy mill we contacted other agencies before going onto the property
8125976 we were removing animals from 12 30 to 7 30 p m saturday and we were working sunday from 7 a m to 5 15 p m
8125977 i have to be honest i saw only a few counts of neglect requiring immediate medical care but there were just so many animals
8125978 ive been in meth labs that smelled better not good
8125979 but the condition of the dogs was the red flag more than the fact that she couldnt document their lineage
8125980 the batch we saw before probably had the worst teeth weve ever seen one dog had to have its entire lower jaw removed hes still ticking though hes about 17 now
8125981 to undertake a project like this the logistics are huge
8125982 its very expensive the rescue and the investigation once you enter into this project you have to follow through
8125983 they are hard to housebreak and often theyre not good with children especially dogs that have been abused or have never had human contact when we place these dogs we look at references we check with your vet and even do a home visit to make sure that youre not running a puppy mill yourself and that youre prepared for a dog we want their next home to be their forever home
8125984 they are a hunting breed and a lot of people dont expect the behavior that comes along with a hunting hound while they can be an excellent couch potato they also are an active breed they can track go into tunnels they do it all its a hunting dog in a small body
8125985 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8125986 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8125987 a hyde park acquaintance at whose home obama attended a gathering early i find hunting libtards quite easy most are flamboyant and not
8125988 she was one of a number of people trying to find out where this person was being taken
8125989 just shown in that context you dont get what the whole dynamics or the full situation is
8125990 obviously looking at that id want to look at the use of force report id want the department to look and evaluate
8125991 my job is to maintain objectivity until the completion of an investigation what i can say is i think that that warrants additional review but i have to maintain objectivity on anything because you cant rush to judgment
8125992 its really frustrating that we have this incident of violence now
8125993 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense said school superintendent david thweatt of the harrold independent school district
8125994 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8125995 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree said doug pennington spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence
8125996 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count mr thweatt said
8125997 they were like fish in a barrel mr thweatt said
8125998 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12 he said many eventually joined the rodeo circuit or work in the oil fields
8125999 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual
8126000 a lot of responsibility for someone who already has a lot of responsibility in the classroom
8126001 and i really think all these issues may be caused by my mothers excessive blogging when i was a child
8126002 um excuse me i know this will sound really strange and might be well um ill just ask do you happen to have a blog
8126003 itu urusan pemerintah indonesia kita percaya indonesia akan segera mengambil keputusan tentang hal itu
8126004 meskipun sampai saat ini ancaman terorisme dan kriminal terhadap warga australia tetap ada
8126005 kami ke sini untuk mengucapkan terima kasih pada hillary dan memprotes kecurangan yang dilakukan pada kami oleh komite nasional demokrat
8126006 ini akan jadi yang pertama kali sejak 1976 saya tak bisa percaya obama
8126007 kami di sini untuk menyampaikan pada kepemimpinan demokrat bahwa tidak baik mengabaikan 18 juta suara
8126008 saya tak mempercayai obama dia berubah ubah tiap waktu kami tak tahu apapun soal masa lalunya bagaimana kami tahu dia bukan semacam militan saya memilih mccain
8126009 saya sedih dan kecewa karena dia hillary kalah tapi saya akan memilih obama pada november
8126010 emphatic plea at the democratic national convention to unite behind her rival senator barack obama no matter what ill will lingers
8126011 now girls i know what youre thinking you wish you were rocking a mini van like me
8126012 we dont think our assessment is incorrect our attorney does not feel there was a problem with the assessment
8126013 the standard line with all attorneys in these types of cases is everything is overvalued
8126014 it is important to have the proper person represent us so the town hopefully comes out ahead
8126015 the appellate tax board wont let cases go on for long period of time and town needs to dispense with it
8126016 they say we cant carry this liability indefinitely we need to know what is our final determination
8126017 i would estimate it would be between 5 000 and 10 000
8126018 i would completely back off that if it becomes dog eat dog negotiations
8126019 madeline brick left the school in great shape jfk is ready to be opened
8126020 there has been a lot of turmoil with the jfk principal position especially in the past few months
8126021 when i was asked i thought it would be a great opportunity to work with parents staff and the students again
8126022 i was planning on continuing to get my handicap down my golf game is not any better
8126023 the thing is every year we get a certain amount of calls related to saw injuries
8126024 most of them come down to common sense and just taking a few minutes to look at what youre doing before you do it
8126025 a chain saw is one of the most dangerous pieces of equipment around because once you stop cutting the blade is still spinning
8126026 the instructions are very explicit but do people take the time to read them thats the question
8126027 i think if you went into home depot to the area where they sell chain saws and said can you give me a little advice they would
8126028 any of our folks in the garden department and anyone in tool rental can provide operating instruction
8126029 if someone comes in and says i need help we certainly have the folks who can help them
8126030 if youre not familiar with the tool get some kind of instruction at a minimum from the guy you buy it from
8126031 if youre not real familiar with them then maybe find somebody thats got some experience its just common sense
8126032 it didnt do a lot of damage on my arm fortunately but for a moment i wondered if i had a face left
8126033 let me tell you this chain saws are very dangerous
8126034 people they dont know they think a chain saw gives you a right to manhood with a chain saw in your hands you become a real man you can become a real man with an arm missing or a foot missing
8126035 because somebody somewhere is going to get hurt it might only be one person but thats too many
8126036 it is a shame people can just walk into home depot and buy a chain saw and put it into a tree and think they know what theyre doing you have to respect the fact that it can kill you or injure you severely if you dont have that fear you will end up hurting yourself
8126037 election 08 panel declared that hillary not once urged her supporters to vote for barack obama and that she did the absolute minimum to support obama
8126038 i want you to ask yourself were you in this campaign just for me we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and we will do it again with president obama and the democrats
8126039 the time is now to unite one party one purpose
8126040 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8126041 barack obama is my candidate he must be our president
8126042 i havent spent the past thirty five years fighting to see another republican in the white house
8126043 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8126044 ina 212 states that any immigrant who does not have the correct travel documents will not be admitted to the united states
8126045 i think its be great but the first i heard of it was when i grabbed a coffee on the way to training and i looked at the paper
8126046 look at the end of the season we do a review like we do every other year and part of that is what we do with the senior coach
8126047 we must inject credibility to indec you cant have statistics which only generate mistrust in society
8126048 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8126049 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8126050 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8126051 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8126052 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
8126053 the 21 year old drinking age is not working and has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on college campuses
8126054 i think that a clear political statement is once again very important in this situation georgia is a free and independent country and every free and independent country can decide together with the members of nato when and how it joins nato in december there will be an initial assessment of the situation and we are clearly on track for a georgia nato membership
8126055 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8126056 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8126057 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8126058 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8126059 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8126060 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8126061 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8126062 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8126063 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8126064 i think its going to come down to who do you trust the future of your family and country with the people who have been trustworthy or the ones that people dont really know too much about
8126065 we are not relaxing in our effort to cut public expenditure
8126066 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8126067 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8126068 villagers had asked the militants to surrender before they laid siege
8126069 but the militants requested safe passage that was denied then the militants threw a hand grenade in the direction of the villagers to break the siege
8126070 we fear the ttl could replicate the same in buner if they were given a free hand we have held several meetings and decided that we wouldnt let buner go swats way
8126071 we are seeing the writing on the wall if we dont prevent the indian and karzai agents at this stage there is every possibility the military would launch an operation and the 11million population would be migrating in a state of helplessness to safer areas
8126072 the ttp had already bombed about a dozen girls schools besides bombing 50 cd shops and attacking police stations
8126073 before the ttp resorts to torching more schools we have decided to resist them
8126074 we are not going to let the taliban play with the future of our people we dont want schools to be burnt and our coming generations uneducated
8126075 the good news is that all the political parties are supporting the move because it has paid off in the context of buner
8126076 all the criminals in these areas are carrying out anti social activities in the garb of the taliban the taliban used to be students of religious schools who guided the people on the right path but now the situation is quite the opposite they are leading anti social activities
8126077 we will kill any person seen after midnight we have advised the local population not to come out of their houses
8126078 militants bring destruction wherever they go for a bright future prosperity and development follow the wise decisions of formation of anti taliban squads in buner hangu dir swabi mardan lakki marwat where the people have decided to cleans their areas of militants at their own
8126079 today it is clear that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
8126080 to my sorrow foreign minister livni pushed the idea of freeing more terrorists freeing terrorists at the same time kidnapped idf israeli defence forces soldier gilad shalit is not with us leaves me with a difficult feeling making a bad decision is worse than deciding nothing and we have freed 700 prisoners this year without anything in return
8126081 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8126082 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8126083 temptations of the west how to be modern in india pakistan tibet and beyond
8126084 there shall be no needy among you if only you heed hashem your god
8126085 for there shall never cease to be needy ones in your land
8126086 there shall be no needy among you if only you heed hashem your god
8126087 for there shall never cease to be needy ones in your land
8126088 there shall be no needy among you if only you heed hashem your god
8126089 for there shall never cease to be needy ones in your land
8126090 if we ever doubted their understanding of the gospel these songs wipe away any doubt
8126091 but god said he was satisfied with what jesus did
8126092 its only by his blood that we can be saved doing good things to say thank you to god is very good but it cannot save us because we are nothing but sinners
8126093 what is independence it means that when you learn about the outcome of one event it has no influence on your guess about the probability of success in another event however in this case if a student gets rejected from 8 schools that does influence my guess about how likely he is to get rejected from the 9th school id say someone who gets rejected from 8 schools is more likely to get rejected from the 9th than someone who didnt get rejected from 8 schools
8126094 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
8126095 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
8126096 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
8126097 oh wait till youve done it for as long as i have
8126098 our high school investments have had a positive impact on student performance as seen by the improved sat scores yet it remains clear that we need to continue improving the high school experience
8126099 the conversation is clearly shifting in minority households and the sat is part of that
8126100 income earnings and poverty data from the 2007 american community survey
8126101 with 4 a gallon milk prices and history making high gas prices we need policy makers to focus on health and economic policies that create jobs reduce poverty and provide access to health care for all to strengthen families
8126102 while poverty figures dont necessarily signify a need for food assistance it certainly seems the food bank will continue to be busy
8126103 its obvious at least in 2007 and this part of 2008 that people are hurting
8126104 todays announcement reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy
8126105 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8126106 sen obama is fighting for economic opportunity for all americans while sen mccain is committed to continuing bush policies that favor oil companies and tax breaks for the rich

8126121 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8126122 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8126123 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8126124 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force
8126125 more than you ever know you picked me up when i was down
8126126 i found this sign while travelling in australia there were 4 signs on this bridge and they all said the same thing
8126127 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8126128 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8126129 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8126130 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8126131 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8126132 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8126133 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8126134 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8126135 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8126136 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8126137 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8126138 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8126139 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8126140 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8126141 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8126143 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8126144 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8126145 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8126146 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8126147 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8126148 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8126149 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8126150 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8126151 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8126152 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8126153 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8126154 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8126155 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8126156 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8126157 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8126158 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8126159 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8126160 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8126161 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8126162 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8126163 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8126164 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8126165 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8126166 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8126167 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8126168 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8126169 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8126170 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8126171 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8126175 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8126176 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8126177 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8126178 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8126179 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8126180 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8126181 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8126196 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8126197 if mccain is is the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8126198 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home or a home
8126199 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8126200 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8126201 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8126202 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8126203 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8126204 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8126205 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8126206 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8126207 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8126208 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8126209 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8126210 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8126211 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8126212 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8126217 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8126218 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8126219 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8126220 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable

8126341 hei kamu lihat apa sih sampai memelototi fotonya begitu cari kutu
8126342 eh enggak pak kata dian bencis foto ini kalau diperhatikan terus menerus akan bergerak
8126343 aku enggak ngerti mungkin bapak bisa lihat kalau aku tidak liat apapun yang bergerak

8126345 yudha cerita istrinya dan kembarnya adelia pergi ke seorang peramal bernama na untuk sekedar menanyakan sesuatu waktu yudha tanya mau nanya apa aurelia enggak menjawab cuma senyum sinis aja enggak lama setelah itu aurelia meninggal sayangnya saat aurelia meninggal yudha tidak ada disampingnya dia sedang di rumah seorang kenalannya kata adelia aurelia terjatuh di kamar mandi dan langsung meninggal dan menurut adelia dokter bilang aurelia terkena shock yang hebat saat terjatuh jadi dia bisa meninggal yudha merasa sangat heran tentang sebab kematian istrinya tapi setiap kali dia menatap mayat istrinya dia merasa itu bukan istrinya tapi orang lain yang mirip lalu dua bulan yang lalu dia dateng lagi jeng bawa foto orang yang lagi dirawat di icu coba perhatiin deh orangnya walaupun fotonya agak kabur tapi mata batinku lihat itu adalah kembaran yang seorang lagi dia adalah laki laki kalau aku gunakan kemampuanku dia terlihat seperti mm seperti orang yang seputih mayat dan dari leher ke pinggangnya bolong bener bener bolong auranya sangat jahat yudha menjelaskan padaku dia dapet foto itu setelah dia diam diam ikutin adelia jadi ceritanya saat dia sedang ada dijalan sambil mengendarai motornya mobilnya sudah dijual oleh aurelia dia lihat mobil adelia melintas iseng iseng dia buntutin eh enggak tahunya mobilnya berhenti di sebuah rumah sakit dan atas dorongan aneh yudha terus ngebuntutin sampai adelia masuk ke sebuah ruang khusus seperti ruangan icu dengan menyuap seorang perawat yang mata duitan dia suruh deh perawatnya ambil fotonya si sakit dan itu lah fotonya foto si kembar yang ketiga yang mungkin juga dicari oleh jeng na

8126364 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8126365 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8126366 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8126367 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8126368 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped

8126406 this is andrea martinez for espn well see you at the world cup 20
8126407 you saw the wounds sheriff what man could possibly do that
8126408 yes lieutenant ive seen these wounds before too many times in fact
8126409 i have some business first lieutenant have to arrest some villians who think theyve escaped me then get that dead man over to the undertaker
8126410 you have good taste in clothes monsieur shall we meet for lunch in my office of course
8126411 noon would be fine i need to attend to my business as well
8126412 cant see how no militia get kilt thought you suppose to guard us
8126413 the soldier who was killed was trying to desert the company
8126414 i have not had the pleasure of meeting your family lieutenant but i have heard of your mother and father
8126415 in fact my grandfather knows the valmonts and always seemed surprised the family escaped from france after the revolution
8126416 in short my father was an in a small town in burgundy and through some connections sent me to harvard to study law and politics
8126417 ah yes a long story i was visiting relatives in st louis found the university to my liking and later was referred to the job my shooting abilities seemed to qualify me
8126418 i see your shooting prowess has landed you an equitable position
8126419 they are snakes monsieur and this is the garden of eden
8126420 why dont you tell me what happened last night lieutenant
8126421 if bakeless hadnt been attacked in such a terrible fashion monsieur i assure you he would have been in prison anyway
8126422 my guess or i should say my theory of these crimes seems correct then
8126423 your men or i should say captain fairweathers militia was called in on this assignment based on a single assumption lieutenant
8126424 each and every one of these killings the same modus operandi
8126425 the means of operation lieutenant in what manner the killings occured
8126426 if you wish monsieur you may borrow any one of my books
8126427 i can offer you a fair price on a set of crystal wine glasses monsieur
8126428 im sure you can lieutenant since your family has cornered the market on them
8126429 of course as you have seen by now our lovely community has no use for such a theory nor does mr creamer who pulled strings with the governor to bring you here to those politicians these murders are the work of other politicians albeit of a vicious and renegade type i didnt believe it even when your monsieur fairweather arrived in our town a week ago but they will have their fancies
8126430 perhaps those wounds were the work of these ruffians made to look like
8126431 i heard there is a bounty for the killers two hundred dollars in cash
8126432 and only one person around here would have that kind of money
8126433 if there is a bounty im sure many men will be after it
8126434 thank you for lending this book i suppose it will give me a reason to visit again
8126435 my pleasure you will be speaking to mr creamer then
8126436 im going to do better than that well see how much the governor really likes me
8126437 as napoleon said never underestimate the size of your position
8126438 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident werden
8126439 barack escolheu o senador joe biden como seu vice presidente
8126440 just as michelle struck me as authentic last night hillary clinton struck me as authentic tonight and i have to add hillary also struck me as a class act
8126441 this was the first speech of this convention to deliver red meat to these delegates and they were hungry for it
8126442 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8126443 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8126444 we need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of american confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges
8126445 now this will not be easy progress never is but it will be impossible if we dont fight to put a democrat back into the white house
8126446 the cynics will surely find something wrong with hillary clintons speech tonight but in my view she was first class in many many ways this was her finest hour
8126447 this is an extraordinary example of a creative shift in thinking that truly places new zealand in the twenty first century
8126448 insulating all houses and reducing fuel poverty by compensating residential electricity users for raised prices should lead to evident health benefits for all new zealanders
8126449 the present poor energy efficiency of our houses in new zealand has had serious public health consequences
8126450 many of our homes were built in the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th when energy seemed so cheap we just used lots of it with the certainty of climate change we dont have the luxury of doing that any more
8126451 creo que la situaci n este momento es de relativa tranquilidad nuestras fuerzas armadas est n haciendo patrullas permanentes en toda la frontera lo que en t rminos militares se habla de peinado que es un patrullaje sistem tico y permanente

8126456 seg n los an lisis internacionales el problema de narcocultivos en colombia ha crecido
8126457 tiene algunas fallas en su objetivo fundamental que era la erradicaci n de cultivos il citos
8126458 ese plan le ofreci a am rica y al mundo que en diez a os no habr a cultivos il citos en colombia y no ha cumplido con ese objetivo
8126459 if you look past the speeches of john mccain heres what you see many of john mccains top advisers top advisers worked as lobbyists for the oil and gas companies i guess that explains why he wants to give another 4 billion dollar tax break to oil companies and if you look past his speeches to his record one thing is absolutely clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8126460 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8126461 the people of pennsylvania cant afford four more years of bush cheney economics and you know what with john mccain thats exactly what wed get john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush over 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8126462 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt now theres a pattern here theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost now speaking for myself and for at least this next election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8126463 just as i am proud of arizona i like to be positive about my fellow arizonans so i wanted to say something positive tonight about senator mccain when i heard him say that the economy is not issue he understands as well as he should my problem was solved because i can say to you tonight positively that john mccain is right he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should
8126464 senator mccain came to michigan and he told those who had been laid off he said well your jobs are gone and they are not coming back well i tell you what if hes president hes probably right if senator obama and joe biden are president and vice president we will create manufacturing jobs in this country
8126465 john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been a part of the middle class and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wakeup call because we just cant afford more of the same
8126466 we want an economy that works for all of us for people who are struggling to own just one home let alone seven homes
8126467 the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america is it john mccain
8126468 no im shocked maybe thats because john mccain continues to claim that president bushs policies have been great for the economy in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 of the time so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8126469 even though john mccain has spent 26 years in washington voting over and over again against investing in renewable energy john mccain does support some renewables he wants to renew the failed bush agenda for another four years john mccain has also renewed the bush rove style of politics focus on bringing down your opponent instead of lifting america up but as a governor who works with the republican legislature everyday i can tell you we cant bring about positive change unless we fix our divisive politics

8126472 insidious practice of racial profiling and discrimination commonly using a trumped up charge of public intoxication the men who are latino said they were falsely arrested on those charges outside downtown san jose bars in separate incidents in 2006 and 2007 and in some instances beaten by officers when they tried to complain about police violence neither city officials or the mens attorney could be reached for comment san jose police have long been at the center of accusations of racial profiling particularly after police released a march 2007 report that gave rise to allegations of police brutality and profiling that report revealed that latinos represented more than half of the force arrests in 2006 police however have consistently denied the allegations and davis has previously pointed out that independent investigations have found no systemic evidence of racial profiing cisco executive slain in detroit is remembered as gifted techie dedicated family man former santa cruz private school teacher charged with molesting students to be released police toddler found dead after being left with 16 year old for five days cops investigating whether three arrested were threat to obama or just meth heads
8126473 the people of pennsylvania cant afford four more years of bush cheney economics and with john mccain thats exactly what wed get
8126474 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8126475 the bush mccain republicans inherited the strongest economy in history and drove it into a ditch they cut taxes on the wealthiest of us and passed on the pain to the least of us they ran up the debt gave huge subsidies to big oil companies and now theyre asking for four more years how bout four more months we cant afford four more years of deficit and debt drift and desperation not four more years four more months
8126476 obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him

8126482 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world
8126483 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8126484 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8126485 has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8126486 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8126487 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8126488 i campaigned hard against obama and i saw over that time that he is capable of leading our country
8126489 i got to know him personally i saw that he is smart and bright and a leader for our party and country

8126515 if id known that was going to happen i wouldnt have gone to the ballpark
8126516 theres nothing like knowing the game is in your control
8126517 nothing that happened to me was because of that man baker
8126518 you have guys who go through their whole careers and dont get injured other guys pitch two years and get injured six times i dont think it has anything to do with a manager or a pitching coach or anything like that its either going to happen or its not
8126519 im talking specifically about starters who consistently pitch six or seven innings
8126520 it just makes sense to have your best pitchers the ones youre paying the most money working those pressure innings
8126521 mentally youre training pitchers to look over their shoulder for the next guy to bail them out and then you have the 12th or 13th best pitcher on your team coming in for important outs that doesnt make sense
8126522 im not even sure i could pitch today id probably want to be a reliever as a starter you have no chance of controlling your destiny you can have a great game and not be able to finish it i trust me more than i trust a reliever
8126523 we were on a performance count not a pitch count
8126524 dont let them take you out win or lose this is great
8126525 pitchers of the generations up to marichals had a belief that this game is mine the idea of doing permanent harm to a pitchers arm didnt come into anyones mind
8126526 i think its proving over time that they arent really saving anybody guys are getting hurt just as much today as they were before if not more so this whole theory about saving their arms i aint buying it i think kids have to throw more and the more they throw the stronger theyll get in time i think it will go back to what it was for 100 years of baseball
8126527 what organization is going to have the guts to go down to the lower minors and have a four man rotation and forget about counting pitches and let them figure out how to pitch i think a lot of them want to its a combination of agents the money in the game today and fear
8126528 you can watch him these days and say now i see some big league ability in him
8126529 it seems he just added your typical adjustments to make
8126530 its a new level for him and hes still quite young he was tripped up for a while but has really taken off at the plate of late
8126531 tuiasosopo for me is one of those types of baseball players that because he didnt have the same advantages of the warm weather high schoolers is just going to need a little more time
8126532 he needed at bats time in the field and he wasnt getting a ton of that until he signed a pro contract hes still what 22 he has time to continue to figure it out and looking at what hes been doing the past several weeks id say hes turned a corner
8126533 hes going to have to get to the major leagues with his bat
8126534 hes not a fast twitch guy he doesnt have a single fast twitch action so you have to hope the bat is there because hes not going to help you in other ways
8126535 but theres plenty left both in terms of time and room for him to keep getting better i am impressed by what ive seen and while id need to see more and more to believe he can hit long term i wouldnt bet against him hes really come a long way

8126585 the cbc is concerned about the route 288 corridor we want monitoring of the reservoir for water quality without an overzealous move to try to change before there is a need
8126586 at no point did any of the staff or a majority of the board members indicate support for tighter restrictions on non residential development
8126587 the board should have not even considered 16 with the water quality data we had
8126588 you cant support an ordinance without data because you dont know that it will do any good and its very burdensome to business chesterfield is loaded with regulations with unintended consequences i think we should review the cost of these regulations before we vote on them

8126696 in the last federal government the liberals promised a strong investment for clean water and to fix hot spots im sure the people of the lake will see strong support for clean water in the liberal platform in the next election
8126697 until the conservative government came along there was no funding from any party at the federal level
8126698 weve got 30 million were working with it as best as possible yes we would love to have bigger projects and we would like to have it move along quicker but anything we can get is a bonus
8126699 theres a strategy as far as the conservation authority is concerned weve taken the lead assisting with projects the federal government has relied on the conservation authority because weve got the science in many cases it makes sense theyre respecting the people who have put years of research into the lake

8126704 ainley did all the works associated with the 10th in 2007 and the same parameters can be utilized to replace the 9th
8126705 we believe there are significant benefits to the town in awarding this assignment to ainley and to base the design of the 9th structure on that of the 10th
8126706 the most significant benefit to the town would be the potential cost savings associated with reusing the basic design

8126708 the design prepared for the 10th bridge can be utilized for the 9th bridge which is a significant cost savings to the town

8126713 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8126714 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8126715 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying

8126745 when the woman was confronted by the mens statement she later confessed that she had reported the incident to the police because she was afraid that the defendants were going to speak to her family when they stole her phone
8126746 apparently the woman was said to have been seeing the men for money but there were no charges filed as there was no evidence against them
8126747 the euro had a similar move this morning he said
8126748 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point

8126763 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air
8126764 i liked it when he played dead and floated in the water
8126765 when he was placed back into his tank the slightly loose portion of his black swim cap immediately folded over to the right side a telltale symptom of stress and angst and you can be certain that just before he left for beijing he didnt bite that little girls arm off because he was happy

8126776 we are confident that we can capture the majority of the margin improvement that will come from the upturn in the markets through to the net profit line when those investment returns finally turn around he said
8126777 the overwhelming driver of our funds balance this year has regrettably been the negative investment returns mr robinson said
8126778 but theres no doubt that when you talk to advisers it is quieter than historically it has been
8126779 that means the fund flow to us from new clients is a little slow mr robinson said
8126780 we would certainly look at opportunities larger than the current cash availability inside the business he said

8126825 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8126826 the allegations centre around the period of 1970 to the early 1980s so at this stage all the enquiries are at least over 20 years old
8126827 id imagine it would be very hard for anyone thats subject to these sort of things to come forward
8126828 no definitely not we could lose our lives for that jewish child
8126829 unseen by either of us father had appeared in the doorway
8126830 at first betsie and i called these meetings with great timidity but as night after night went by and no guard ever came near us we grew bolder so many now wanted to join us that we held a second service after evening roll call these were services like no others these times in barracks 28 a single meeting night might include a recital of the magnificat in latin by a group of roman catholics a whispered hymn by some lutherans and a sotto voce chant by easter orthodox women with each moment the crowd around us would swell packing the nearby platforms hanging over the edges until the high structures groaned and swayed
8126831 at last either betsie or i would open the bible because only the hollanders could understand the dutch text we would translate aloud in german and then we would hear the life giving words passed back along the aisles in french polish russian czech and back into dutch they were little previews of heaven these evenings beneath the light bulb
8126832 we must tell them what we have learned here we must tell them that there is no pit so deep that he is not deeper still they will listen to us corrie because we have been here
8126833 i had to do it i knew that the message that god forgives has a prior condition that we forgive those who have injured us
8126834 i have become a christian i know that god has forgiven me for the cruel things i did there but i would like to hear it from your lips as well fraulein
8126835 i can lift my hand i can do that much you supply the feeling
8126836 in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
8126837 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son
8126838 dont worry before the tribulation comes you will be translated raptured
8126839 we have failed we should have made the people strong for persecution rather than telling them jesus would come first tell the people how to be strong in times of persecution how to stand when the tribulation comes to stand and not faint
8126840 hey i can use that in the time of tribulation
8126841 if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part evil is spoken of but on your part he is glorified
8126842 will this one i am sitting beside be the next one killed will i be the next one
8126843 daddy i am afraid that i will never be strong enough to be a martyr for jesus christ

8126845 no daddy you give me the money for the ticket just before we get on the train

8126847 this is definitely a good move to try to attract more vaccinations among a group of vulnerable people
8126848 many of these people were slipping through so hopefully this will boost numbers up and send a message that its very important to get immunised
8126849 its more convenient for people to be able to walk straight into a doctors surgery and get immunised and any hurdles we can remove to encourage immunisation the better
8126850 the number of cases have increased as expected but it is still relatively mild compared with previous years
8126851 its not jesus whom im against its just the christians whom i cannot stand
8126852 no matter how ferocious the tiger is it will never devour its young
8126853 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8126854 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8126855 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8126856 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa each application is assessed individually on its merits
8126857 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa
8126858 no no one likes being alone but ive learned how to live with it
8126859 what you too i thought i was the only one
8126860 you cant change who people are without destroying who they were
8126861 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8126862 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8126863 yucks i cant bring myself to talk to you now
8126864 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8126865 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8126866 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8126867 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8126868 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8126869 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom

8127140 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it
8127141 jennifer didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine
8127142 didnt want to waste anybodys time if somethings not right
8127143 theres an embrace but no kissing toy executives want to keep barbies squeaky clean image
8127144 no it was just really great to meet him and people that you usually see on tv to me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
8127145 no thats her business now that were just friends thats not something i have to worry about
8127146 i really enjoyed the second week being able to go out with my teammates i had a great week
8127147 the things you get asked to do this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens im a girl on the loose damn it
8127148 im really excited about obama and the way its playing out i think is perfect i love politics im a huge cnn fan why is there no cnn in this hotel i just want to see the news
8127149 the best way i can describe it is its sort of a senior citizen action film
8127150 we were very conscious that theres maybe two or three movies of a trilogy that really are good
8127151 this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens
8127152 matthew mitchum i was hoping to meet him but maybe the guys are gay or married
8127153 i dont think i have much advice for marriage obviously
8127154 ill give you my number just give me a call
8127155 im not sure i think theres a possibility that he can but it will be tough
8127156 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8127157 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8127158 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8127159 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8127160 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8127161 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8127162 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8127163 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8127164 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8127165 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8127166 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8127167 bakumatsu were the final years of the edo period in japan it was a turning point in japanese history as it was the end of the period of isolation in japan the feudal way of governing was coming to an end and the start of the meiji government which would later take japan to the world power status

8127173 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt

8127176 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8127177 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8127178 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8127179 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8127180 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

8127183 the euro had a similar move this morning he said
8127184 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point
8127185 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8127186 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp he said
8127187 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers

8127189 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8127190 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8127191 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8127192 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8127193 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8127194 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8127195 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8127196 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8127197 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8127198 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8127199 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8127200 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8127201 cursed is every one that contineth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
8127202 the law is holy and the commandments holy just and good
8127203 thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
8127204 if thou meet thy enemys ox or his ass going astray thou shalt surely bring it back to him
8127205 say not i will recompense evil but wait upon the lord and he will save thee
8127206 say not i will do to him as he hath done to me i will render to the man according to his work
8127207 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and the great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
8127208 if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight
8127209 he that hath no sword let him now sell his garment and buy one
8127210 they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword
8127211 smite a servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
8127212 the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink
8127213 they trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel
8127214 they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean
8127215 lord wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to israel
8127216 ready to go with his master to prison and to death
8127217 if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
8127218 do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages
8127219 that it was through faith that gideon david and others waxed valiant in fight and turned to flight the armies of aliens
8127220 girded him with strength to battle and had taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight
8127221 he is the minister of god and a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
8127222 what king going to war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else he sendeth an embassage and desireth conditions of peace
8127223 the nations will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks when nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
8127224 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8127225 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8127226 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8127227 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8127228 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8127229 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8127230 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8127231 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8127232 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8127233 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8127234 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8127235 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8127236 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8127237 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8127238 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8127239 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8127240 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8127241 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8127242 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8127243 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8127244 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8127245 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8127246 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8127247 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8127248 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8127249 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8127250 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8127251 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8127252 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a

8127259 nos debemos sentir involucrados en los cap tulos de sus acontecimientos internos
8127260 nombrar en los t rminos del estatuto general a los funcionarios de la administraci n general de la universidad a los rectores de los centros universitarios y al director general de educaci n media superior autorizar sus licencias aceptar sus renuncias y separarlos de sus cargos por causa grave con audiencia del afectado y escuchando la opini n del consejo general universitario
8127261 es lamentable que la nica instituci n en el estado que ven a manej ndose con decoro haya llegado a ste nivel de descalificaciones lo deseable es que pronto sus rganos de gobierno se estabilicen y que no se pierda la inercia positiva en el mbito acad mico y de investigaci n que ha sido para enorgullecer a los jaliscienses
8127262 y se alamientos sobre los aspectos de promoci n cultural que han puesto a guadalajara en el mapa internacional y adem s han venido generando una importante derrama en el sector tur stico
8127263 confianza en que pronto las aguas vuelvan a su curso pues en todo ste proceso el balance es m s positivo con mucho que lo negativo

8127268 que la inseguridad y la violencia no pueden ser erradicadas por mero decreto

8127272 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8127273 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8127274 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8127298 the petro dictators will never own american wind and sunshine and we should never again be beholden to their barrels of crude
8127299 barack obama understands that the most important barrel of oil is the one that you dont use
8127300 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well

8127309 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8127310 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8127311 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8127315 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8127316 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
8127317 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
8127318 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
8127319 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
8127320 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
8127321 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
8127322 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8127323 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
8127324 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
8127325 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
8127326 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
8127327 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
8127328 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
8127329 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
8127330 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
8127331 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8127332 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8127333 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8127334 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8127335 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8127336 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8127337 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8127338 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8127339 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8127340 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8127341 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8127342 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8127343 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8127344 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8127345 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8127346 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8127347 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8127348 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8127349 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8127350 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8127351 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8127352 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8127353 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8127354 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8127355 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8127356 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8127357 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8127358 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8127359 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8127360 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8127361 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8127362 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8127363 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8127364 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8127365 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8127366 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8127367 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8127368 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8127369 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
8127370 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8127371 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8127372 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8127373 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8127374 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8127375 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8127376 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8127377 how much celebrity drivel weather reports local cop chases and corporate cover ups from the
8127378 undoing legislation already passed by that other pesky branch of government the legislative
8127379 well let you know if we can use your services
8127380 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8127381 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8127382 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8127383 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8127384 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8127385 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8127386 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8127387 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8127388 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8127389 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8127390 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8127391 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8127392 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8127393 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8127394 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8127395 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8127396 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8127397 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8127398 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8127399 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8127400 we were going to have a cake but the fire marshal said that many candles
8127401 the late night host added that theyd ribbed mccain with
8127402 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes
8127403 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina
8127404 the establishment of the latino a studies minor is part of ongoing efforts in the college to ensure programs are relevant for todays student and our rapidly changing world
8127405 im pleased our curriculum reflects current population trends and vast social and political effects of the largest minority on contemporary american culture
8127406 it signals an interest and training in issues having to do with what is now statistically the largest minority group in the u s so of course it would be very valuable to a wide variety of career paths that require knowledge of the diversity of u s cultures
8127407 one thing that makes ku different i would argue is the extent of our emphasis on latin america as a component of latino studies which traditionally has been u s centered
8127408 theyre not going to be fluent in three months but my goal is to get them to feel comfortable and communicate
8127409 you have to flip flop the nouns and the verbs i could not figure that out when i was trying to learn english
8127410 its been a challenge because were so used to speaking english only i do think that english is the most important but at the time we do have spanish speakers coming in to buy cars and we want to be able to communicate
8127411 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
8127412 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
8127413 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
8127414 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
8127415 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
8127416 you can see that people are more scared in general
8127417 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
8127418 it would be a huge hit to our community culturally economically our businesses our people a huge hit
8127419 we are putting a lot of pressure on the minimum wage cashier
8127420 these results say that to induce couponing with a hispanic customer you have to have a relationship
8127421 one way of doing that is to distribute a coupon in person so that theres a human preferably a spanish speaking hispanic human giving it out
8127422 fully leverage telemundo and mun2s original programming through custom branded entertainment digital and mobile cross platform solutions

8127425 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8127426 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8127427 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8127428 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8127429 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8127430 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8127431 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8127432 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8127433 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8127434 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8127435 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8127436 may i direct everybodys attention to this little child over here
8127437 may i direct your attention to this kid right here with only 35 cents a day you can feed children like this

8127440 we were pleased when mi pueblo came along and said they wanted to lease the entire place
8127441 the first time i went into la superior i felt like a kid in a candy store
8127442 to have that kind of selection in an even larger store will be fantastic
8127443 i started talking about going to college and that thought was nowhere in her mind
8127444 she was going to clean houses thats the job she was looking forward to doing the rest of her life to see that limited thinking is sad but we see that over and over again
8127445 they were always saying la migra la migra because they thought maybe they were going to scare me
8127446 i believe it had to be difficult so i could value my education and learn from my companeros that said racist things
8127447 i always said that there was a person that didnt like me but there were a thousand that liked me a lot
8127448 i teach the little ones english and i feel like its a way to thank the community for the help that i received because my teachers were wonderful
8127449 a lot of mexican immigrants come here with the thinking that were just going to work work in the field at a fast food restaurant or whatever what she has in mind is actually much bigger than that
8127450 maribel wanted to move out of that circle of spanish speaking people she is very close to her family probably she offended hispanics because she didnt want to go back into that she wanted more her focus was learning the english language and doing something with that
8127451 because i dont speak english i tell them to speak spanish speak spanish
8127452 when they get back home from school they only talk in spanish so its hard to teach english
8127453 especially if they have a son or daughter that is starting to speak english they use them constantly to translate for them so they dont have to learn it
8127454 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8127455 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8127456 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity

8127480 part of their analysis is of language within conversations and the sentiment that is displayed there the sentiment is then tracked over time and can be a key metric in the success of a campaign their formula for extracting the sentiment is not publicly accessible so i am not sure how they calculate it
8127481 trying to derive or score sentiment out of unstructured text is a hard problem

8127486 collective intellect describes their last year as one focused on adding millions of new social media sources and improving data quality with highly automated categorisation and analytic tools quite rightly they point out that analysis is pointless if you dont start with accurate and comprehensive data collective intellect must be doing something right to have attracted customers from the likes of microsoft chrysler anheuser busch pfizer dell yahoo viacom verizon levis and adobe
8127487 collective intellects nick sowden is the only staff member of the swa vendors described here to let me know hes on twitter and to have subscribed to my twitter hes also one of two to have invited me to link up on linkedin to me being social inspires confidence that they truly think and live social

8127513 our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction
8127514 a suicide car bomb targeted a recruiting centre in the twon of jalowlaa 70 km to the northeast of baquba at 10 30 a m tuesday killing 27 recruits wounding 45
8127515 rushed into a crowd of potential recruits and detonated his explosives laden vest
8127516 theyd received 30 bodies of dead recruits a higher figure than police reported to mcclatchy newspapers
8127517 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8127518 there was black smoke everywhere dead bodies on the ground and people panicking and helping to transfer the injured to the hospital
8127519 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
8127520 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8127521 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking eveidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the are from which pershmerga have just withdrawn
8127522 this is the latest in a series of attacks launched mainly by sunni islamists in diyala
8127523 the attack followed a suicide bombing on sunday night at a tribal sheiks banquest in the western baghdad suburb of abu ghraib
8127524 prime minister nouri malikis negotiators are also bogged down in talks over a long term security agreement with the united states despite a december deadline looming for a deal the shiite led government has also initiated a crackdown on leaders and members of the u s funded sons of iraq movement which includes many former insurgents who allied themselves with america in 2007 to fight al qaeda in iraq since may iraqi security forces have started arresting sunni fighters leaders from the sons of iraq have warned that the measures could drive some of their men back to fighting the government
8127525 fixed deadline for the departure of all u s troops troops from iraq
8127526 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8127527 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8127528 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8127529 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only
8127530 despite the tough words aides insisted a compromise could be found on the two main stumbling blocks to an accord governing the u s military presence in iraq after a united nations mandate expires at the end of the year
8127531 the general manager of the health administration dr hassan zein al abideen
8127532 a police official says the bomb was planted in a car parked on a street used by local government officials going to work
8127533 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8127534 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative
8127535 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them

8127541 wir wollen die us amerikanischen charaktere und konzepte nicht einfach nach japan exportieren unser ziel ist es vielmehr etwas zu schaffen das als teil der gesamten dortigen gesellschaftsstruktur anerkannt wird
8127542 um am japanischen markt erfolgreich sein zu k nnen m ssen die comic figuren so angepasst werden dass sie die japanische kultur reflektieren
8127543 mobiltelefone sind bei der japanischen jugend besonders popul r deshalb werden wir die aktuellen produktionen dort auch f r den mobilfunkmarkt aufbereiten
8127544 wir sind sehr aufgeregt dass wir bei der kooperation mit marvel dabei sein d rfen
8127545 die arbeit an den marvel charakteren ist sehr unterschiedlich von dem was wir bisher gemacht haben wir kreieren nicht einfach eine neue anime serie sondern erschaffen eine bisher g nzlich unbekannte hybridform aus westlichen und japanischen animationstechniken
8127546 der grund daf r ist in zwei aspekten zu suchen
8127547 wer sich auf eigene kosten impfen l sst muss mit kosten in h he von etwa 450 euro rechnen
8127548 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8127549 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8127550 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8127551 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8127552 wir glauben da wurde ein hoch riskanter test auf den markt gebracht der nicht ausreichend klinisch getestet wurde und der die gesundheit der bev lkerung gef hrden k nnte
8127553 leider gibt es bisher noch immer keinen zuverl ssigen test gegen eierstockkrebs

8127556 it made sense to make those changes then and it appeared to work because we had a lot of fans visit the clubhouse store this year to buy their favorite team apparel
8127557 since day one of my tenure i made it known that our goal was to get families back to the ballpark by providing affordable family entertainment and we enjoyed seeing our hard work payoff
8127558 we were experiencing great crowds right up until hurricane dolly changed the landscape of the valley and particularly harlingen
8127559 attendance was light for the 3 4 days after that but picked up nicely for the remaining home games
8127560 of course i was given a reason as to why i was relieved of my duties and its important for me to have people understand that it had nothing to do with nothing in terms of the explanation i was given by ownership
8127561 several issues remain unresolved regarding my contract but i am more concerned that our fan base season ticket holders and community know that i was fired and i did not resign
8127562 i made a commitment to turn this organization around and we were well on our way to doing that so i dont want anyone to think for a second that i bailed on this project because that couldnt be further from the truth
8127563 i want to take this opportunity to personally thank our fans vendors season tickets city of harlingen and the entire community for their outstanding commitment to the whitewings during my tenure
8127564 to politicize this as a way to come against burgess and leaving this building as an eyesore is reprehensible
8127565 that was always my thought did he have a church was he really a reverend
8127566 were fighting for our children we shall not be moved
8127567 it will be very nice because there it will be very easy to stay inside because its inside the hospital
8127568 for the last couple of years it has been almost every night
8127569 our goal would be to maintain everything that it is possible to maintain
8127570 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
8127571 in joe biden barack obama has found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president
8127572 we dont look at it that he talks too much
8127573 my private life has been lived in a public arena
8127574 an ultraconservative colleague of mine stopped himself in the middle of a tear about bidens liberalism and said but i have to admit he took care of his kids a reference to the senators coming home every night to parent his two young sons after the car accident
8127575 of course some folks criticize sen biden some more bitterly than others after more than 30 years in public life thats a given
8127576 no one i know doubts that his family values are deep and sincere
8127577 the idea seems to be that delaware is just too small to allow anyone to get away with very much for very long
8127578 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8127579 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8127580 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8127581 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
8127582 si tu y yo nos hubi semos conocido en la edad media seriamos un par de monjes de clausura de esos que se pasan la vida luchando contra el demonio porque se masturban a escondidas
8127583 uniquely qualified to nudge the country toward the color purple
8127584 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics thats all about tearing people down instead of lifting the country up
8127585 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
8127586 the new law one of the most far reaching on housing in decades marks the centerpiece of washingtons efforts to address the nations housing meltdown
8127587 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

8127589 like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
8127590 for the first time in a long time we have the chance to build a new majority of not just democrats but independents and republicans whove lost faith in their washington leaders but want to believe again who desperately want something new
8127591 americas most over rated product higher education www martynemko com articles americas most overrated product higher education id1539
8127592 winning the campus teaching award is the kiss of death when it comes to tenure
8127593 were probably not going to hear a lot about fiscal responsibility in the next 10 weeks
8127594 over time people are going to have to assume more personal responsibility for their own future except for those who are poor
8127595 become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
8127596 was the opposite of the one that sen biden claimed i had made
8127597 honeycombs big yeah yeah yeah its not small no no no
8127598 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8127599 the strong man john mitchell and the secrets of watergate
8127600 sen obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8127601 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8127602 are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
8127603 security for himself his regime his country and his ideology in precisely that order
8127604 virtually everyone is wrong georgia didnt start it on august 7 nor on any other date the south ossetian militia started it on august 6 when its fighters fired on georgian peacekeepers and georgian villages with weapons banned by the agreement hammered out between the two sides in 1994 at the same time the russian military sent its invasion force bearing down on georgia from the north side of the caucasus mountains on the russian side of the border through the roki tunnel and into georgia this happened before saakashvili sent additional troops to south ossetia and allegedly started the war
8127605 one of the smallest and most understaffed departments in the university
8127606 designed specifically for the intellectual and social interests of blacks and other third world students
8127607 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
8127608 john stossel sounds like a real defeatist we have our backs to the wall and hes raising the white flag
8127609 it is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it better buy it of them
8127610 the short term goal here is not complete energy independence the goal is partial independence from those countries many of whose citizens hate us and would do us harm
8127611 new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every american north south east west young old will have decent quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege
8127612 personally like to be a member of a labor union
8127613 by picking a ham sandwich obama in a masterstroke has sent a dog whistle message that he is not a muslim as muslims abhor ham
8127614 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8127615 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8127616 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8127617 nos hemos planteado retos que en ocasiones iban contra corriente e incluso nos parec an ut picos y los hemos superado antes de lo previsto
8127618 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
8127619 unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking
8127620 most of the variation in the drinking age occurred in the 1980s
8127621 appears to have only a minor impact on teen drinking
8127622 fails to have the fatality reducing effects that previous papers have reported

8127715 september is the worst performing month for the s amp p
8127716 has created a far more compelling advertising proposition for leading brand advertisers
8127717 members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8127718 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8127719 while the perception of attractive value exists in japan the reality of realizing or unlocking this value
8127720 its not just subprime it can affect credit cards and other asset classes
8127721 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8127722 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8127723 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8127724 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8127725 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8127726 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8127727 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8127728 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8127729 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8127730 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8127731 we have great control of land and infrastructure in this area expertise we have gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past efforts we believe we have developed a predictive model which allows us to better target our completions to productive shales the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two earlier wells in the liard shales make this test very interesting
8127732 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8127733 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8127734 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8127735 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8127736 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8127737 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8127738 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8127739 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8127740 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8127741 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8127742 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8127743 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8127744 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8127745 if we got less than 30 000 id be disappointed as long as the weather holds up
8127746 we need to get out of bankruptcy its costing us 80 000 a day in interest fees and bankruptcy charges were very close to a deal
8127747 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8127748 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8127749 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8127750 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8127751 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8127752 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8127753 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8127754 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8127755 si los madrile os somos as nuestra progamaci n no pod a ser menos
8127756 im sorry for shooting the girl and it was an accident
8127757 but im not going to talk about it beyond what ive said in my prepared statement
8127758 and what appears to be overlooked is the fact that the actor was still very combative at the hospital and it took eight staff members to restrain him his coma was not the direct result of being hit with the taser
8127759 he was in a seizure in my living room i didnt want the cops in my house if he wasnt having a seizure i could have handled it myself
8127760 there have been questions raised about whether tasers are being used in the way they are intended
8127761 physical affirmative actions which attempt to prevent an officers control but never attempts to harm the officer
8127762 spit a wad of fluffy like material from his mouth
8127763 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8127764 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8127765 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8127766 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8127767 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8127768 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8127769 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8127770 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8127771 the laptop computer which was sold for just under 70 to british it manager andrew chapman contained customers credit card applications account details signatures cellphone numbers and mothers maiden names the royal bank of scotland and natwest bank confirmed their customers details were included in the computer
8127772 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8127773 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8127774 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8127775 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8127776 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8127777 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8127778 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8127779 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8127780 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8127781 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8127782 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8127783 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8127784 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8127785 when we created chiltern early phase our vision was to develop a brand that would be synonymous with quality and service excellence we now have the team organization and facilities to deliver on this vision and provide a truly expert early phase service at reasonable cost
8127786 i am delighted to see the integration completed so thoroughly and ahead of schedule we are now looking to build on our units long histories of good science and medicine both in the areas where we have traditionally been strong but also in new areas of specialization such as diabetes and cardiovascular medicine we are also looking forward to forging academic links to provide specialist studies involving new biomarkers

8127789 the server market has experienced acceleration in revenue growth over the past 4 quarters customers around the globe continue to deploy a wide range of technologies to meet their computing needs and as a result idc saw strong growth in blades unix systems and ibm system z demand across the marketplace diversity in market demand demonstrates customers do not believe a single standardized infrastructure is capable of meeting all their computing needs
8127790 at the same time the pricing challenges many oems experienced particularly in the x86 server market is a concern as it may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand as enterprise budgets face further scrutiny in the second half of 2008
8127791 the refresh cycle were currently seeing in the midrange and high end segments is part of the it transformation cycle that is continuing as older scalable systems with 4 sockets 8 sockets or more are being replaced either by new scale up servers or by groups of scale out servers
8127792 the growth in midrange and high end servers this quarter shows that customers still see value in leveraging these scalable servers with built in high availability and ras features for some of their most mission critical workloads and for workload consolidation
8127793 ibm regained the top spot in unix market share on the strength of its power based system p and merged power systems families growing revenue nearly 25 7 in the quarter and gaining 5 1 points in year over year comparisons
8127794 sun took second position with 31 1 share posting a drop of 5 6 points from a year ago and hp rounds out the top three with 25 8 share and a gain of 1 point overall the unix market remains a significant source of revenue and competition among the top three suppliers
8127795 while all the major vendors exhibited strong unit growth there was significant price competition throughout the quarter
8127796 low end volume servers such as 1 and 2 socket systems are somewhat viewed as commodities and experienced the most pricing pressure additionally the quarter was made noteworthy by the fact that several of the tier one vendors began shipping their new systems targeting large scale datacenters typically these are stripped down servers that are designed to operate at maximum power efficiency all components and features that are not essential including server redundancy are eliminated to reduce the capital expenditure of these datacenter customers
8127797 english is a dazzlingly idiosyncratic tongue full of quirks and irregularities that often seem willfully at odds with logic and common sense this is a language where cleave can mean to cut in half or to hold two halves together where the simple word set has 126 different meanings as a verb 58 as a noun and 10 as a participial adjective where if you can run fast you are moving swiftly but if you are stuck fast you are not moving at all and where colonel freight once and ache are strikingly at odds with their spellings
8127798 thats what my dad has taught me to do so i just had to do what i was taught
8127799 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8127800 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8127801 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8127802 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8127803 the trip was great because we got to see how much we progressed from spring to summer and also how far we have to go before the middle of october
8127804 we wanted to focus on a few things mainly playing really hard defensively trying to play unselfish offensively and play with a level of intensity and speed that we want on both ends and i think all in all they did all that
8127805 it would just sit there and stare at you with this look on his face like youre next

8127808 income earnings and poverty data from the 2007 american community survey
8127809 with 4 a gallon milk prices and history making high gas prices we need policy makers to focus on health and economic policies that create jobs reduce poverty and provide access to health care for all to strengthen families
8127810 while poverty figures dont necessarily signify a need for food assistance it certainly seems the food bank will continue to be busy
8127811 its obvious at least in 2007 and this part of 2008 that people are hurting
8127812 todays announcement reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy
8127813 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8127814 sen obama is fighting for economic opportunity for all americans while sen mccain is committed to continuing bush policies that favor oil companies and tax breaks for the rich
8127815 the biggest difference will be the quarterback with bill stull back in the lineup
8127816 i also think we have a lot of depth at a lot of positions particularly receiver we have three good tight ends and our offensive line has new faces so fans are going to be looking in their program making sure they have the right guys were going to be playing a lot of guys who are going to get a lot of work for the first time so it should be exciting
8127817 actually win the game and then they should all be happy
8127818 it is pretty simple i know they all want the ball and i feel confident in a lot of them and they all deserve to get the ball but were going to do what we have to do to win the game
8127819 they have a nice package and they have good players
8127820 the package is dictated by what you do and they have taught it well they are very multiple and what makes their package similar to a lot of people in the run and shoot is they do all of their formations in the same packages so their blocking assignments dont change it is hard to prepare for because of the speed of it and the fact that they will make calls at the line based on what we do on defense
8127821 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president i mean it i know john doesnt like me saying it but the truth of the matter is it is
8127822 i wouldnt touch this site wearing a biohazard suit and a ten foot pole

8127825 i may just throw in the towel ive been downtown since 1955 ive got no place to go
8127826 business is business but to not be compassionate and take care of the businesses who have paid rent for years they treat us like theyre stepping on a cockroach they just crush you they have no compassion for their fellow man
8127827 i have to be philosophical about it theres a low tide and theres a high tide i thank all the people of the world for their patronage

8127829 aimed at putting to rest any notion that the governor may act unilaterally
8127830 he cannot implement an executive order increasing council 94s health care deductions if doing so runs afoul of the law as it would under the present circumstances
8127831 the governor is subject to all of the laws of this state that govern collective bargaining disputes and his executive powers neither supersede them transcend them nor trump them in whole or in part
8127832 weve got to do the best thing we can do for our citizens and i wish we didnt have to go through the courts to do this
8127833 a week ago it was one thing now she completely changes her mind
8127834 i think thats just ridiculous i think shes way overstepped her authority here
8127835 this latest decision by judge hurst attempts to usurp the authority of the office of the governor and flagrantly disregards separation of powers the judge has no authority to negotiate for the unions and has no authority to mandate that my office report to her on issues before the states labor relations board
8127836 we are elated that judge hurst has proven that collective bargaining is alive and well in rhode island
8127837 all these court proceedings they favor us but our end result is to get a contract and the fairest and most equitable way to do that is to return to the bargaining table
8127838 this is a small amount of money in the whole scheme of things
8127839 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8127840 we have to get going by electing barack obama president
8127841 i did all i could and im truly saddened that barack wasnt elected
8127842 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8127848 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8127849 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8127850 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8127851 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8127852 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8127853 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8127854 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

8127859 i vividly remember how rowena faintly cried in her mothers arms
8127860 i was shocked to see rowena in distress emaciated ah mere skin and bones
8127861 she had swollen face hands and feet and discolored blotches appeared on her tiny skinny body rowena was three years old then the doctors said she had kwa kwas o yeah kwashiorkor sus
8127862 when her mother handed her to us we outrightly refused to take her in for fear that she might die any moment in our care rowenas mother begged us to spare her daughters life as she could no longer afford to give her another day to live indeed love outpowered our fears the moment i held her close to my heart right then i knew we did it for love

8127864 finally on the fifth dawn of june he was gone i watched him breathe laboriously in and out in and out his chest moving up and down up and down i got to kiss him goodbye and he just stopped breathing he went serenely
8127865 it was best for domingo to have died and have been buried peacefully now but me that time yeah i was alive but i felt i was buried too buried deep in debt

8127867 in response to a sharp increase in demand for japan which has virtually no natural energy resources of its own aims to take the lead in environmentally friendly energy
8127868 the production of hydrogen by microorganisms is intimately linked to their cellular processes which must be understood to optimize bioenergy yields
8127869 in general thermophiles have a simpler fermentation pattern compared to lower temperature mesophiles resulting in fewer byproducts
8127870 the process is performed at almost ambient temperature and pressure and therefore it is expected to be less energy intensive than thermochemical or electrochemical production methods which are alternative ways to get hydrogen
8127871 the wide range of carbohydrates it grows on suggests that c saccharolyticus will yield a plethora of industrially relevant carbohydrate
8127872 once we are able to engineer caldi not yet possible we want to further improve its hydrogen producing capacity
8127873 with the information fused together and with being able to just ask for what we want with simple commands anyone can dive deeply into the data with almost no training
8127874 features planned for future release can do complicated things like correlate data from different sources timeline it and pull out complex relationships
8127875 the responsibility of application delivery is moving to the network professionals the result is that infrastructure availability and utilization are no longer good indicators of network health the network management team needs to shift from fault to performance based management this will allow network professionals to become more visible and relevant to their business customers as they are able to provide excellent service delivery to the business in transporting data from one end of the system to the other end as fast as possible
8127876 the system enables us to assign problems immediately to the correct it support group what we like to call doing things right the first time

8127881 expertise independence and intellectual courage roger thompson a respected scholar of military and especially u
8127882 his professional work is insightful and highly regarded by military specialists
8127883 his work has been widely recognized by the international naval authorities including the chiefs of naval staffs of the german spanish and italian navies as well as the chief of naval operations of the united states navy
8127884 combat motivation and behaviour among naval forces a discussion paper
8127885 a classic in the sociology of the armed forces and civil military relations
8127886 i was in the persian gulf in 1990 as a reporter with the amphibious ready group aboard the uss
8127887 discontinue the up or out promotion system and use the systems used by all other english speaking countries
8127888 for nearly a century the u s navy has been plagued by a self imposed albatross an approach to personnel management known as the individual replacement system and the up or out promotion system also hampered by a force structure developed for warfare of the past and an out of date doctrine of mobilization this has created a culture where only the positive is seen thus no learning takes place it encourages a culture of corruption where only yes men survive and adaptation only exists on power point slides roger thompson has conducted a masterpiece of research lessons not learned tells the story of this self inflicted wound how it prevents the navy as well as the entire u s military from evolving and being prepared to fight in the 21st century true leaders of our republic if there are any need to take this as the beginning blue print toward revolutionary reform
8127889 roger thompson raises crucial questions about choices made by the united states with respect to national defense matters while readers may not agree with every point made here due regard for the truth demands that each be critically debated thompson questions whether investment in technology and sheer size has come at the expense of investment in tactics strategy and war fighting skills and shows that other navies are superior he further questions whether adverse psychological and social political factors inherent in the united states are the reason for its weakness is the u s navy learning from its failures this is a debate of absolute necessity among friends and well done in this important book
8127890 thompson has written the most important military reform book in almost a decade and certainly the most important book for the post 20th century u s navy ever the usn is on a collision course with disaster and to try to save it thompson ambushes the reader immediately with a flurry of covered up facts and incidents not unlike the missiles bombs torpedoes and sea mines that are going to overwhelm the navy in real life as it goes down overcome by events obe this book is a slap in the face to make the usn wake up before its indeed too late since there is no internal constructive criticism taking place now
8127891 provocative in detailing what he sees as the navys shortcomings from expensive ships and aircraft that often dont perform up to expectations to serious personnel problems and offering a twelve step program for fixing the problems thompson opens an important debate on an issue thats crucial to national security in the twenty first century
8127892 lessons not learned is more than a brilliant book its an irrefutable case for reform and change in the united states navy a service that maintains itself almost exclusively to fight in the aftermath of americas misguided occupation of iraq the united states will rely more than ever on the reach and effectiveness of its naval power thompson points the way ahead the question is will anyone in the navy staff listen
8127893 the u s navy is among the most powerful fighting forces in the world yet it has repeatedly been embarrassed in exercises with smaller and less technologically equipped forces in lessons not learned respected military scholar roger thompson discusses the institutional biases the outmoded strategic thinking the use of the wrong technology at the wrong times and much more this book is a scholarly and perceptive study that delves into all of this and more and helps the reader understand why such a formidable force is not living up to its potential this is a must read for naval scholars strategists or anyone who really cares about the navy and its sailors
8127894 a thought provoking and occasionally sobering contribution to current naval literature this is a book which will infuriate many people for different reasons but it is scholarly well meaning obviously written by someone who cares and is therefore hard to dismiss lightly
8127895 roger thompson has spent decades thinking about military culture and the bureaucracy that hampers effectiveness he has reduced his commentaries questioning aspects of how the u s navy conducts itself into a single volume this book is not for those with delusions of invincibility it takes a realistic look at adversaries both conventional and asymmetric that could undermine if not defeat u s navy combat platforms one may disagree with thompsons observations and recommendations however for those passionate about our navy it is necessary to read criticism that is constructive and offers readers a way to reflect on how to solve problems that undermine the u s navy
8127896 mr thompson has himself another smart tough and thought provoking book thompsons approach is both a sobering and effective means of making his case an excellent read
8127897 combat motivation and behavior among naval forces a discussion paper
8127898 interesting and enjoyable reading the paper provides an excellent account of the factors which determine motivation
8127899 realistic rigorous and easy to read in certain aspects thompsons paper constitutes a master text for the professionals of the sea
8127900 roger thompsons study provides an excellent basis for study and discussion
8127901 but you wont eat for a week when were home
8127902 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8127903 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8127904 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8127905 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8127906 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8127907 oh those those are called love bugs because you can see that they are connected and then one of the mates dies and the other carries on and then it dies too they mate for life
8127908 i think it is really special that you stepped up to bat and raised your kids all by yourself
8127909 well that is what god put me here to do
8127910 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8127911 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8127912 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8127913 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8127914 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8127915 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8127916 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8127917 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8127918 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8127919 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8127920 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8127921 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8127922 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8127923 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8127924 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8127925 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8127926 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8127927 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8127928 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8127929 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8127930 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8127931 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8127932 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8127933 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8127934 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8127935 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8127936 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8127937 great what are these people marching and carrying on about
8127938 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8127939 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8127940 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8127941 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8127942 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8127943 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8127944 were definitely interested in having tao li continue with peter and were working out the details of his contract
8127945 if he leaves because of his family i will fully respect and understand his decision
8127946 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8127947 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8127948 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8127949 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8127950 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8127951 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8127952 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8127953 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8127954 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8127955 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8127956 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8127957 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8127958 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8127959 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8127960 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8127961 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8127962 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8127963 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8127964 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8127965 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8127966 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8127967 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8127968 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8127969 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8127970 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8127971 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8127972 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8127973 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8127974 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8127975 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8127976 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8127977 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8127978 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8127979 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8127980 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8127981 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8127982 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8127983 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8127984 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8127985 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8127986 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8127987 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8127988 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8127989 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8127990 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8127991 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8127992 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8127993 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8127994 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8127995 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8127996 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8127997 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8127998 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8127999 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8128000 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8128001 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8128002 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8128003 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8128004 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8128005 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8128006 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8128007 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8128008 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8128009 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8128010 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8128011 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8128012 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8128013 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8128014 the armed forces of the philippines sadly confirms reports that one of its c 130 planes crashed in waters between davao and samal island

8128018 once our warehouses were full we had to rent a badminton court just to store them
8128019 it has cost us a lot of money to launder and store the clothes so we decided it would be better just to auction them
8128020 just a week after the quake we told people to stop sending us secondhand clothes but they kept on coming

8128074 traditionally fuel bills have not always been at the top of the agenda for smes and owners with little time on their hands have been happy to assume that prices are comparable across the board

8128076 by understanding their contracts and benefiting from the support available from alternative suppliers and industry bodies businesses can reduce the financial impact of high energy bills
8128077 sadly our survey shows we still have a long way to go to convince businesses that there is a cheaper way but with wholesale prices soaring the case for switching to a supplier like e4b is stronger than ever

8128105 labour party donor owen glenns letter to the privileges committee completely contradicts winston peters version of events about the substantial 100 000 donation made by mr glenn to mr peters legal costs
8128106 mr glenns letter represents a direct challenge to mr peters credibility from the only other person in the world in a position to know the facts
8128107 from parliaments point of view the privileges committee provides an appropriate vehicle to resolve the points of conflict and to hold individuals to account but from the prime ministers and the governments point of view that is not enough
8128108 governments and ministers must enjoy the confidence of the parliament and ultimately the public faced with todays revelations it is no longer acceptable for mr peters to offer bluster and insults where simple courteous honest answers are required
8128109 it is no longer acceptable or credible for helen clark to assert a facade of confidence in her foreign affairs minister and to fail to ask the plain questions of him that she has a duty to the public to ask
8128110 faced with todays revelations helen clark must stand mr peters down as a minister that is what i would do if i were prime minister helen clark has stood ministers from labour down for much less
8128111 unless he can provide a credible explanation about this serious issue he should be unacceptable to helen clark as a minister in her labour led government

8128128 the production of hydrogen by microorganisms is intimately linked to their cellular processes which must be understood to optimize bioenergy yields
8128129 in general thermophiles have a simpler fermentation pattern compared to lower temperature mesophiles resulting in fewer byproducts
8128130 the process is performed at almost ambient temperature and pressure and therefore it is expected to be less energy intensive than thermochemical or electrochemical production methods which are alternative ways to get hydrogen
8128131 the wide range of carbohydrates it grows on suggests that c saccharolyticus will yield a plethora of industrially relevant carbohydrate
8128132 once we are able to engineer caldi not yet possible we want to further improve its hydrogen producing capacity

8128144 the trade union environment has always been very strong a force to be reckoned with
8128145 some aspects were taken from the government of ontario the trade union was in touch with ontarios

8128147 part of my mission is to really try to build matured relations encourage them to keep their link to barbados and to be interested in giving back and contributing to development of barbados
8128148 my family applied for visas to come to canada for my brother there but the canadians refused visas for my mother and me and only say that my father can receive a visa
8128149 the picture is not clear so my family wants to come there
8128150 but how can we leave my father alone there the situation is so wrong my mother is continuously weeping my father is not in a good situation this is the time that i can help them
8128151 theres no question about it theyre going through a very difficult period and uncertain times with the possible death of their son
8128152 working with the mission to take the appropriate steps to resolve the situation and we expect to have a positive resolution soon
8128153 a lot of foreigners die in canada and my understanding is that the immigration people go out of their way to make sure they facilitate this kind of thing

8128157 i need my sewing machine out to make cushions and curtains
8128158 of course there should be a canadian presence in the caucuses
8128159 canada felt very strongly that it was not business as usual with russia and that the ball is in russias court to implement what it has committed itself to implement and to take those steps that weve all been expecting russia to take
8128160 disproportionate use of force totally inconsistent with their peacekeeping role
8128161 coming out of todays meeting one of the priorities for us was a strong reaffirmation that both georgia and ukraine remain very much on track for nato membership
8128162 in other words that timing and that agenda are unaffected by the events of the last couple weeks
8128163 in light of the current situation in georgia and after consultation with our american allies we agreed that it would be inappropriate to go ahead with exercise vigilant eagle a planned combined norad russia military exercise that was scheduled to begin august 20 2008
8128164 many thought it was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
8128165 weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
8128166 so thats one element but its not the only element its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern
8128167 i can tell you that nato support has increased regarding assistance since these tragic events took place
8128168 we appreciate very much the support of canada and we support the readiness of the canadian side on economical and humanitarian assistance
8128169 i think the relations are very good at this time and we will continue this level of co operation
8128170 on the 8 th of august the georgian army violated international agreements signed by the georgian government and blessed by the united nations
8128171 for 24 hours they pounded defenseless ossetians killing 1 500 people and murdering in cold blood 15 russian peacekeepers who were there according to international agreements and at the invitation of the georgian government
8128172 our tanks came to protect the lives of ossetians and our citizens
8128173 it is a canadian suggestion that every united nations country has a responsibility to protect and in this case its so clear cut i dont know how it can be distorted
8128174 im not sure canadian authorities are as well versed in the real facts about the start of the conflicts as they should be
8128175 from their immediate public reaction i saw they bought the american scenario
8128176 my concern is that we dont destroy the positive baggage that was accumulated in our relations with our partners over the last years
8128177 this is what im discussing with your government your business community with your political establishment
8128178 i believe what we achieved in the military economic and political fields including with the harper government over the past two years is very solid and based both on russian and canadian national interests
8128179 i dont believe there is any rationale to review relations in a negative way
8128180 i signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of south ossetias and abkhazias independence
8128181 russia calls on other states to follow its example this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8128182 canada is gravely concerned about russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia this recognition violates georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia as well as to the six point peace plan brokered by president nicolas sarkozy on behalf of the eu
8128183 since sakashvili is still intent on new attacks against ossetians and abkhazians and our american friends are speedily rearming him the only option for us is of course to recognize their independence and have security arrangements to protect both them and our peacekeepers there
8128184 we recognize their independence were not for a land grab
8128185 it is classic completely satisfying a pepper but more than a pepper abstract in that it is completely outside subject matter

8128187 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8128188 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8128189 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
8128190 i think everybodys best interests are in patching it up
8128191 canada is gravely concerned about russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8128192 this recognition violates georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia as well as to the six point peace plan brokered by president nicolas sarkozy on behalf of the eu
8128193 russias actions have tremendously alarmed the new states in eastern europe they want to have that assurance the question is whether nato can provide that assurance
8128194 he did not think that nato could come in time
8128195 mr tusk said well its not much good to get help when its too late that is something nato has to address because natos credibility as an alliance is extremely important
8128196 has shown the paucity of eu and u s leverage over russia
8128197 its going to be more difficult for some of those members which were recalcitrant to publicly state their positions countries like france and germany were very public about their opposition to nato membership for georgia because they didnt want to be seen as acquiescing to the russians or looking like they were only concerned about energy imports from russia
8128198 at the moment i think its russia taking advantage of the divisions and this is definitely something that nato members have to work on
8128199 the other side in both of these crises in one case russia in the other case the taliban is they can play to those divisions to their advantage and they will
8128200 there are differences among the allies as to how deeply they want to wade into the conflict
8128201 nato is not stretched by any capability its just stretched by the political will that military leaders might think important but politicians dont see
8128202 i would have said in the 90s and the early 2000s when things were not moving very quickly in the canadian economy for nuclear that it would have been a much more important place for us
8128203 but of course right now we are at a high level of activity when you consider all of the activities that are out there going on
8128204 i think thinking were going to be there at the very beginning is kind of lost now
8128205 just thinking about all of the players that are already active there
8128206 for us the opportunity for making sales in what is the worlds second most populous country is an extremely important thing for us
8128207 just the sheer magnitude of work that could be available to our companies is very big and i think from that stage on we end up having the prospect of increasing export output
8128208 early on i think its fair to say the response was received or at least our pitch was received and as soon as the u s india discussions became very intense we likewise were interested in seeing a response but we had very little in the way of sensing that the government would move very fast on it until just very recently indeed
8128209 it is truly a shame that canadas relations with a like minded country have been frozen for decades while the rest of canadas allies began to re engage india in 2000 we have lagged behind
8128210 helps to know that there is an industry that is interested in pursuing opportunities externally
8128211 this would be deeply worrisome if canadas non proliferation policies are being driven by the trade interests of just one sector as opposed to our international obligations and our commitment to nuclear non proliferation treaty
8128212 i would also remind minister emerson that he is no longer the minister of trade he is now the minister of foreign affairs so as much as he loves trade he needs to shift his focus a bit to the broader vision of where canada wants to be in the world
8128213 the lack of decision lack of consensus at this months nsg meeting is significant
8128214 whats sad is that there were other countries that did question the deal and we could have been with them
8128215 for this government to make decisions based on very very narrow trade interests or very very narrow filter vis vis relations with the united states is very short sighted
8128216 i dont think its inappropriate to have our austrian ambassador there obviously because austria was the host country
8128217 but given that the issues centred around non proliferation i would have hoped mr grinius was playing an important role there and it would have sent a message if mr grinius was given the lead representative role for canada at this meeting
8128218 that is surprising because this is a meeting which is addressing the most fundamental of non proliferation rules
8128219 if you took the rule seriously it would strike me that you send to the meeting those people who know its background how it came into being and why its a very important non proliferation rule and at a minimum take huge care about the circumstances under which there might be an exemption to it
8128220 you want to go see the birdies and the iguanas
8128221 why is there only one kind of steak on this menu if this is a steakhouse
8128222 well they didnt say it was a comprehensive steakhouse maybe its a one steak steakhouse
8128223 all right then now ill shoot you off the cliff
8128224 i nevah heahd of them what ah you feeding them

8128226 terrorists did not just attack the united states on september 11 they attacked the world and free trade
8128227 the big priorities will focus on the security and economic side because they really go hand in hand

8128230 a red flag rises over nepal what lies ahead in the maoist government
8128231 this is a pedagogical thing and goes against traditional canadian principles of objectivity and this is a matter of history which should really be immune to political pressures
8128232 thats something for canadian educational institutions to consider themselves we dont need to remind them of that
8128233 the school boards decision to go ahead anyway and teach it as genocide its very objectionable thats why turkish parents are concerned and i sympathize with them
8128234 you can teach it as a dispute or under ottoman history maybe but you cannot teach it in the same category with holocaust and rwanda this is a very serious crime you cannot accuse a nation or its people of that which amounts to slander and hate propaganda because its not correct
8128235 why should my daughter alongside with her armenian friends sit in the same classroom and hear one sided inaccurate versions of history which is categorized with the worst crime in the world
8128236 the course is needed we cannot bury our heads in the sand anymore
8128237 this is where we have to move on we have to turn the page we have to acknowledge what happened we have to teach our children what happened
8128238 the issue its not to try to stigmatize certain segments in our society in canada on the controversy its something the students should learn from these past experiences and in the turkish armenian case it is the hype and paranoia of the turkish government inflaming the issue here because they are getting involved in these issues
8128239 we do not have any issue with the turkish canadian community
8128240 there was never any intent to offend any community or to suggest that one persons suffering was greater than anothers
8128241 we had to select areas that were well resourced that had materials that were available for high school students

8128244 is he suansing making liars out of the media men who quoted him in their stories i am more convinced that this blanket denial of lto chief suansing is just an excuse because he doesnt have proof to substantiate his claims
8128245 it is also an obvious attempt to smokescreen the inefficiency and incompetence of the lto in carrying out its mandate

8128259 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
8128260 polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
8128261 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all

8128274 and in 2008 he mccain still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8128275 john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it a part of americas future for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8128276 after eight years of a white house waiting hand and foot on big oil john mccain offers more of the same at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices when american families are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted 25 times against renewable and alternative energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind energy
8128277 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8128278 and guess who voted with president bush 90 percent of the time sen john mccain
8128279 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8128280 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8128281 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil
8128282 in the liberal multiculturalist perspective all groups can assert their identity except jews whose very self assertion equals zionist racism

8128288 by size of government we are referring to government spending outside of mandatory spending its the argument that outside of mandatory spending this is the most immediate way that barack obama will have an impact on government spending and when you include his spending proposals it accounts for a 23 percent increase
8128289 by size of government we are referring to a government with no social security no medicare no medicaid no food stamps no federal employee retirement benefits and no interest on the national debt

8128317 is a role model for all women they can do whatever the want to do
8128318 a shockingly minimal endorsement of obama she mentions him ten times and every mention with the partial exception of one was a generic could have been applied to any of the other democrats that ran for president
8128319 she said what she had to say but she didnt say any more she said that michelle obama will be a great first lady she never said that barack obama will be a great president of the united states
8128320 i thought for her own political future it was a really smart speech i thought it was fine for obama she did what she had to do

8128338 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8128339 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8128340 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8128341 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8128342 as we understand it and were waiting for final confirmation of this two light planes possibly landing or taking off from moorabbin have clipped wings
8128343 one of those planes landed successfully and the other has crash landed into a houses garden area and as we understand it it was the pilot of the crashed plane that has been killed
8128344 there is a school right on the corner if it had come down another few hundred yards it would have been in the school
8128345 on a hot night youll be sitting in your tv room and you can hardly hear the tv they come down so low
8128346 it was nerve racking ive thought about it often what would happen if one of those planes came down its so densely populated and if youre driving down centre dandenong road they would almost touch your car during landing
8128347 i always thought somethings going to happen one day and ive lived to see it
8128348 because they are both training aircraft and both are operated by the royal victoria aero club you would assume they were both on training exercises
8128349 moorabbin airport holds a certificate from us and we audit them but we dont look at the geographic location of the airport thats a planning issue for the government
8128350 most of the big training airports in australia are in pretty similar suburban locations so its not as if moorabbin is robinson crusoe in this situation it used to be way out in the bush and the city has grown up around it

8128353 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8128354 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8128355 it was well alight in the lounge room but the house wasnt burning that much but by the time fire brigades got there it was well on fire
8128356 everyone was in panic and in shock they were all out in the road
8128357 once fire crews got inside the house they tragically recovered the body of a child every firefighter wants to save everyone its just so tragic
8128358 i could see it was going to be bad thats when i went outside they were hosing the place down and there was not much else anybody could do
8128359 it appeared to be a big fire but there was no danger to the houses next door there was one truck with about six hoses going
8128360 the grandmother did look distraught the family and everybody was just standing around so i offered accommodation to the son if they needed it but they said they were fine

8128362 like the temple worshippers christians too need to be sure they are worshipping their god in accordance with what he has shown himself to be they may not be constructing a visible idol yet their conception of him may not be biblical they may not think of him simply as just but also as harsh not simply as loving but also as sentimental as we have seen psalm 50 shows us that it is possible to call him yahweh and yet to be thinking of him as if he is baal the psalms with their god centered theology are a most effective antidote to wrong thinking about god and so may be effective in reforming our worship
8128363 hi id like to add you to my professional network on linkedin
8128364 we ve got to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states she said we don t have a moment to lose or a vote to spare nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance
8128365 a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8128366 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident werden
8128367 es ist an der zeit uns zu einer partei zu vereinen mit einem ziel amerika zur ck auf den richtigen weg zu bringen egal ob ihr barack obama unterst tzt habt oder mich
8128368 wir m ssen den kampf f r die zukunft amerikas gemeinsam f hren
8128369 aber wir k nnen uns nicht leisten die vergangenen acht jahre noch einmal vier jahre lang zu wiederholen
8128370 der grund daf r ist in zwei aspekten zu suchen
8128371 wer sich auf eigene kosten impfen l sst muss mit kosten in h he von etwa 450 euro rechnen
8128372 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8128373 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8128374 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8128375 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8128376 leider gibt es bisher noch immer keinen zuverl ssigen test gegen eierstockkrebs
8128377 es w re sch n und wichtig dass wir endlich einen verl ssichen test haben aber das kann noch eine ganze weile dauern
8128378 wenn die frauen zum beispiel durch eine umfangszunahme am bauch selbst auf die idee kommen dass etwas nicht stimmen k nnte ist es oftmals schon zu sp t
8128379 die heilungschancen im fr hstadium liegen hier bei ann hrend 99 prozent doch wir haben mit dem muttermundabstrich ein erprobtes und seit vielen jahren erfolgreich eingesetztes nachweisverfahren
8128380 wir haben chiltern early phase mit der vision gegr ndet eine marke zu entwickeln die mit qualit t und ausgezeichneten serviceleistungen synonym ist wir verf gen nun ber das team die organisation und die einrichtungen um diese vision in die realit t umzusetzen und usserst fachkundige fr hphasen dienstleistungen zu angemessenen kosten anzubieten
8128381 ich bin hoch erfreut dar ber dass die integration so gr ndlich und fr her als geplant abgeschlossen werden konnte wir freuen uns nun darauf auf der langen liste wissenschaftlicher und medizinischer erfolge unseres gesch ftsbereichs aufzubauen dabei richten wir unsere anstrengungen sowohl auf bereiche in denen wir traditionell stark vertreten sind als auch auf neue spezialisierungsbereiche wie diabetes und kardiovaskul re medizin wir erwarten ausserdem die etablierung von beziehungen mit akademischen einrichtungen um fachstudien mit neuen biomarkern durchzuf hren
8128382 wir wollen die us amerikanischen charaktere und konzepte nicht einfach nach japan exportieren unser ziel ist es vielmehr etwas zu schaffen das als teil der gesamten dortigen gesellschaftsstruktur anerkannt wird
8128383 um am japanischen markt erfolgreich sein zu k nnen m ssen die comic figuren so angepasst werden dass sie die japanische kultur reflektieren
8128384 mobiltelefone sind bei der japanischen jugend besonders popul r deshalb werden wir die aktuellen produktionen dort auch f r den mobilfunkmarkt aufbereiten
8128385 wir sind sehr aufgeregt dass wir bei der kooperation mit marvel dabei sein d rfen
8128386 die arbeit an den marvel charakteren ist sehr unterschiedlich von dem was wir bisher gemacht haben wir kreieren nicht einfach eine neue anime serie sondern erschaffen eine bisher g nzlich unbekannte hybridform aus westlichen und japanischen animationstechniken
8128387 we were there we know how horrible war is and we ask all governments everywhere to consider every possible means of peaceful negotiation before even thinking of committing its citizens to violent conflict
8128388 he cant play ke2 because i have the fork on g3 after bxe4 i need to tell him he should have castled on move 15
8128389 and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since he talked about
8128390 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for
8128391 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8128392 abram fell on his face and god talked with him
8128393 for in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form and in him you have been made complete and he is the head over all rule and authority and in him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of christ having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of god who raised him from the dead
8128394 in a place where there are trees mountains and running water all of which he quite appreciates
8128395 one skilled in the science of joining together in an orderly fashion the knowledge of one field of learning with that of other fields
8128396 although i have read the ny times almost daily since junior high school it wasnt until my politics matured that i realized its function as the establishments official line of right thinking
8128397 its exciting more vaccines means more lives are going to be saved
8128398 you vaccinate the small ones but the ripple effect goes through to the older people
8128399 not just as a cost but as an economic generating investment
8128400 i just hope that we get somebody to listen to us
8128401 only five black rhinos can be hunted each year and only male rhinos that dont contribute in reproduction can be hunted
8128402 this appalling act of killing an endangered animal underscores the serious situation facing both species of rhino in south africa which has seen an unprecedented increase in rhino poaching
8128403 we have resorted to a system of one animal per hunter per year which decreases the chances of illegal trade
8128404 this indiscriminate illegal trade in rhino is directly linked to organised crime
8128405 how did you manage to surprise us at the beginning of the october 1973 war
8128406 instead of reading the intelligence reports you should have read our poets
8128407 the germans killed six million jews and barely six years later you made peace with them but with us the jews refuse to make peace
8128408 es el momento de unir al partido estamos en el mismo equipo
8128409 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente
8128410 ya sea que me hayan votado a m o a barack ha llegado el momento de unirnos como un solo partido y con un nico objetivo
8128411 el destino de nuestra naci n y el futuro de nuestros ni os est en juego
8128412 estas elecciones no son para elegir a liberal o conservador a la izquierda o a la derecha son para elegir al futuro o al pasado
8128413 son cuatro a os m s que simplemente no nos podemos permitir
8128414 ahora mismo en estos momentos vitales para nuestra historia tenemos una oportunidad de acertar y la situaci n actual simplemente no nos vale
8128415 vengan temporalmente a colombia rindan sus diligencias y regresen a estados unidos
8128416 sin lugar a dudas que si se conciencia a las autoridades norteamericanas de lo que es justicia y paz todo es posible las penas por narcotr fico se pueden cumplir por mucho tiempo las penas de justicia y paz se deben cumplir ahora
8128417 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8128418 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8128419 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8128420 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8128421 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8128422 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8128423 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8128424 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8128425 the preliminary investigations indicate that 3 to 4 kilograms of explosives was used in the bomb
8128426 because of guys like you our whole society is going to the dogs
8128427 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand his credibility has been shot to bits
8128428 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8128429 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8128430 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8128431 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa each application is assessed individually on its merits
8128432 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa
8128433 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8128434 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8128435 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8128436 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8128437 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8128438 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8128439 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8128440 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8128441 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8128442 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8128443 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8128444 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8128445 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8128446 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8128447 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8128448 the stock routes are managed at the moment by 47 rural lands protection boards which look after them for biodiversity values and things like that
8128449 a review has recommended to the nsw government that travelling stock routes should be ceded back to the department of lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention which means they have to be profitable
8128450 this means the department of lands can do whatever they see fit with their routes they can lease them or sell them or do whatever they like
8128451 the drovers and environmentalists agree that the network should stay connected and not as bits and pieces of land that all have different values with different developments on them
8128452 this is definitely a good move to try to attract more vaccinations among a group of vulnerable people
8128453 many of these people were slipping through so hopefully this will boost numbers up and send a message that its very important to get immunised
8128454 its more convenient for people to be able to walk straight into a doctors surgery and get immunised and any hurdles we can remove to encourage immunisation the better
8128455 the number of cases have increased as expected but it is still relatively mild compared with previous years
8128456 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8128457 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8128458 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8128459 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8128460 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8128461 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8128462 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner

8128466 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8128467 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8128468 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance live blog rudds big plan
8128469 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8128470 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8128471 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8128472 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8128473 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8128474 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8128475 this culture must also be matched to effective transparency and accountability mechansims that meet the needs of parents policy makers and the broader community
8128476 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8128477 gasp oh no theyre going to project manage the thing themselves while living on another continent and they dont speak swahili and theyve sold their children to finance the local artisan crafted kitchen chandelier that any fool can see will never work anyway

8128488 but i dont know about the warning thing i mean we know what the rules are thats the warning rules
8128489 we have asked our officials to prepare a joint plan of action dealing with the range of interests and issues that we have
8128490 our relations are growing fast they are much more modest than they should be in terms of trade
8128491 but i am glad to see that investment is growing and it is on both sides
8128492 we appreciate very much the work being done by australia in terms of law and order and also support of the united nations
8128493 nathan retires as a life member of our club since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8128494 well always remember the animated bass responses the selfless acts of courage and the long runs out of defence which were trademarks of his 11 years as a player
8128495 exclusive contracts have been one of the most significant barriers to competition cable prices have risen about 93 percent in the last 10 years this is a way to introduce additional competition which will result in lower prices and greater innovation

8128500 ibms ballarat expansion will be a major boost for the local economy with the investment to increase education and skills in the region
8128501 over the next five years it will create 300 jobs and is expected to contribute an additional 61 million to the regions economy
8128502 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1 350 employees across 30 enterprises
8128503 clearly what were seeing is the economy is growing at a slower rate and some companies are laying off staff but other companies are actually taking advantage of victorias economy and creating jobs
8128504 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8128505 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8128506 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8128507 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8128508 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8128509 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8128510 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8128511 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8128512 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8128513 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8128514 the clan has been one of the principle suppliers of heroin in western europe since the middle of the 90s
8128515 1 500 kg thats between 25 to 50 per cent of what people consume in switzerland in one year
8128516 the influence of ethnic albanian criminal groups is still very strong especially in the heroin market and its not abating
8128517 the vast majority of heroin sold in switzerland still transits via ethnic albanian groups
8128518 they had a period of unprecedented access to european markets in the 1990s and early 2000s and took advantage of that and others took advantage of them but stopping speedboat traffic to italy had a big effect i dont think theyre competitive in the long term
8128519 but i dont think this makes for a very competitive drug trafficking group in the long term as violence attracts unwanted attention what tends to happen with these albanian crime groups is that they build up to a certain level then they shoot each other over an honour issue which undermines their place in the market
8128520 the swiss police are quite good in stopping the stuff and make a lot of seizures but it continues to be a place that a lot of traffickers favour
8128521 we dont know exactly where this surge in heroin supply is headed theres a belief that its being stockpiled getting banked

8128531 en las ligas de verano de las vegas trif n y yo tuvimos ocasi n de verle en directo en cuatro partidos y en estos d as su evoluci n en los partidos con la selecci n b lgara est siendo muy positiva
8128532 su madurez y su conocimiento de la liga acb facilitar n su adaptaci n al equipo y a la competici n por sus caracter sticas adem s se complementar muy bien con la actual configuraci n de la plantilla y aportar fiabilidad y capacidad anotadora al per metro

8128548 sin duda merecer n la pena pues que los chavales aprendan un idioma nuevo conozcan otra cultura acudan a colegios con gente de aquel pa s y se relacionen con otros j venes de su edad les enriquecer bastante y les ampliar el horizonte

8128576 i have the transcripts of about 27 hours of interviews i did with chet about 17 or 18 years ago
8128577 i needed to talk to chet for the book i was writing but he refused to speak to me because he was apparently offended by something i had written about him in 1978 or something i had no idea what it was so i sat down and wrote him a long letter apologizing for whatever transgression i had committed and asked him to reconsider he finally said he would agree to be interviewed but only if he could tell his entire life story i told him i only needed him to talk about the music years but he was adamant it was his life story or nothing so during a number of sessions over a period of several weeks chet sat at my kitchen table telling his life story you can have the transcripts if you want them

8128591 ornithologists now use mist nets these nearly invisible nets are set up like fences and function as huge spider webs catching unsuspecting birds the researcher carefully extracts the bird from the net each bird is measured aged sexed and banded with an individually numbered anklet then the bird is released i photographed these birds while they are caught in mist nets moments before the ornithologist extracts them here the birds inhabit a fascinating space between our framework of the bush and the hand it is a fragile and embarrassing moment before they disappear back into the woods and into data

8128604 a georgia school library media program must include a plan for flexibly scheduled media center access for students and teachers in groups or as individuals simultaneously throughout each instructional day accessibility shall refer to the facility the staff and the resources and shall be based on instructional need flexible scheduling is maintained by allowing full participation of teachers and the library media specialist in collaborative planning and allowing students to come to the library media center at any time
8128605 schools must adopt the educational philosophy that the library media program is fully integrated into the educational program this integration strengthens the teaching learning process so that students can develop the vital skills necessary to locate analyze evaluate interpret and communicate information and ideas
8128606 the conviction that flexible scheduling is a sound educational practice stems from the understanding gained through educational research into effective learning applications of brain research to the field of educational practice strongly suggest that because the brain learns by recognizing or finding patterns it is important for learning opportunities to allow the learner to fit the new ideas into already existing knowledge

8128616 sci fi has enjoyed tremendous success with stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis and were proud to be the home of the new stargate universe
8128617 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way
8128618 a little more character based a little less rooted in a sci fi mythology
8128619 it really does come down to characters and stories that are engaging and that people want to see that they feel like they havent seen before
8128620 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
8128621 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
8128622 its not the case that anything is being pushed aside any more than sg 1 is pushed aside

8128648 let us flee lest the building fall down for cerinthus the enemy of the truth is inside
8128649 they are not to be heard who assure themselves that there is to be an earthly reign of a thousand years who think with the heretic cerinthus for the kingdom of christ is now eternal in the saints although the glory of the saints shall be manifest after the resurrection
8128650 not long after the days of paul arose the millennarians who limited the reign of christ to a thousand years their fiction is too puerile to require or deserve refutation

8128671 our understanding was that the schools would put them online
8128672 if we were to get the information id have no problem reviving it
8128673 as faculty read the evaluations and take the feedback seriously they address the issues students take up with them and change or improve their teaching
8128674 its definitely been a goal to publish them again online but we havent had the opportunity or the manpower
8128675 with the emergence of other online sites that were more realistic and unedited its given a more realistic perspective to students

8128701 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8128702 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8128703 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8128704 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8128705 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8128706 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom

8128719 but mccain wasnt always a staunch bush backer in 2005 his support for bushs position on legislation reached a low of 77 percent last year when he launched his latest bid for the gop presidential nomination he voted with bush 95 percent of the time
8128720 mccain has received more than 1 5 million in contributions from oil and gas industry employees and their spouses according to the nonpartisan center for responsive politics obama has received about 423 000
8128721 the 4 billion in tax breaks for oil companies is part of mccains plan to reduce corporate taxes overall and does not represent an additional tax benefit for these companies

8128758 i heard a steel man say the other day in fact more than one recently that wages should come down
8128759 reduction of income of labor is not a remedy for business depression it is a direct and contributing cause
8128760 the paraffine companies inc has made no reductions in personnel nor has it made any wage cuts believes such reductions can be and should be avoided
8128761 a general reduction of wages and salaries at this time is entirely unwarranted
8128762 wage reductions would in our opinion retard and not stimulate business
8128763 the farm board was created to assist the farmer and not for politics
8128764 i notice the democratic national committee has adopted as a slogan the failure of the farm board this seems to be copied almost word for word from the grain dealers and the chamber of commerce of the united states
8128765 certain interests he meant the grain brokers which seem to feel they have a god given right to handle the products of the farmers and who have accumulated immense fortunes in doing so doubtless will be easy picking for any politician of any party who is willing to play their game
8128766 however farmers as a class seem to be aware that their present unhappy condition is a result of long years of unregulated production while they listened to gigantic schemes that high powered statesmen have had to offer

8128770 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8128771 it matters because we are known by who we spend out time with arent we
8128772 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
8128773 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8128774 i dont think thats nearly sufficient because obama was aware as an adult of what ayers had done
8128775 rather than being post partisan pragmatist obama he is at home working with people who are far on the left end of the spectrum
8128776 why wont our spineless media cover our poor dead troops
8128777 the unconvention is an umbrella that provides a non partisan response to the rnc
8128778 we are trying to provide something other than what we get will get at the rnc we need to get past the expected scripted conversation and look at what participatory politics mean this is a non traditional way of getting at the issues

8128789 and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8128790 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people
8128791 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or enduring the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership

8128811 portland has been calling the trail blazers want a point guard and are willing to part with travis outlaw starkville native to get a floor general from the griz its probably more likely that the blazers would want conley and not kyle lowry in this scenario because conley is the purest point guard in the bunch and portland could pull off a reunion with former teammate greg oden

8128818 she got the message across that her supporters need to come and get behind barack obama
8128819 i think she sincerely means it i hope people dont keep looking for cracks
8128820 she reached out for all of the different segments she even appealed to the african american community that she had problems with in the primaries
8128821 she did her homework she touched on something dear to african americans

8128843 the big problem we were always going to have was what we had left in our legs we saw today that when joe public got out ahead of us with the schedule weve had and the travel weve had its been taken out of us certainly were pleased to only lose 2 1 joe public had a couple of chances but we had a couple of chances as well so weve given ourselves a chance
8128844 we knew joe public had good players players we had to keep our eyes on and what we saw tonight was exactly what wed thought wed get
8128845 what worked against us was the amount of time it took to get here we had some injuries as well and had to make some changes so that was against us joe public played well and deserved to win the game but were glad that we have a chance next week
8128846 they played better passed the ball better we knew it was going to be tough the biggest thing for us was that we gave ourselves the chance to tie
8128847 i apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced when trying to view or download my

8128849 whether or not there is a discontinuation syndrome in patients who are abruptly discontinued from paxil
8128850 there was no systematic effort really to look at the withdrawal syndrome
8128851 few numbers of patients experienced any adverse event after being randomized off paxil into the placebo group and the percentages are certainly very small
8128852 we very much agree with dr laughrens earlier conclusion that there is no clear paxil withdrawal syndrome
8128853 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8128854 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8128855 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8128856 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham

8128866 the hotel was on lock down the elevators were locked they were telling people that you couldnt leave the shuttle bus over the pepsi center was cancelled
8128867 what was frightening to me if they were supposed to be there to protect i want to know who they were protecting
8128868 i asked my dad to come down and walk with me
8128869 and he refused saying hed seen all the police officers that getting arrested is a young mans game one he didnt need
8128870 i dont need a crowd with me but ill tell you i am very proud of the people who have shown the courage to come out and march they should be applauded instead they are being arrested
8128871 it was awful i had to work out a lot and could only eat certain things it was the regime of it all that i didnt enjoy

8128881 we moeten geen landelijke wetgeving willen die alleen gebaseerd is op randstedelijke problematiek

8128883 het overleg met eigenaren functioneert ook nu al redelijk in zwolle we zitten niet echt te wachten op een hele administratie rond leegstand
8128884 if i cant get the mercedes instead of the stupid lexus
8128885 we have them write a paper about why they want to be teachers
8128886 most of them will say i used to pretend i was a teacher when i was a little kid
8128887 teaching is a noble profession but it shouldnt require a vow of poverty salaries are a problem teachers make 20 000 a year less than other professionals with comparable education and salaries havent been keeping pace with inflation the cost of health insurance is driving teachers into other professions a lack of mentoring and support can make new teachers feel very isolated particularly when todays students have such complex needs
8128888 we look for what we call disposition the disposition to teach its not enough just to love kids you have to have more than that you have to have a lot of patience you have to have dedication to the profession you have to be able to get along well not just with children but with colleagues and you have to be an excellent communicator communication is key in education today because youre working with parents colleagues and administrators so we look for all of those skills
8128889 i come home and i may still have papers to grade and lesson plans to think about for the following day its hard to define when my school day is done and when my personal life begins
8128890 you can have maybe five hours of roughly 30 students and if you do even just two assignments a week thats 300 papers a week that you have to correct youre given a prep hour every day but theres just no way you can get it all done and thats just correcting planning creating tests and creating assignments too
8128891 we had one copy machine for a school of 2 000
8128892 if you run out i think i ran out in march i couldnt make any more copies unless i begged them off of other teachers
8128893 there are kids who really want to do well and want to be challenged and in the same class there are kids who could care less and are only there because they are required to be because they are under 16 its difficult to inspire those bottom level kids while keeping the top level kids challenged enough and you cant ignore the middle kids who are working hard but maybe are still struggling
8128894 what is most depressing is when i get a student who comes with so many issues that i feel ill equipped to deal with im not a social worker im not a psychiatrist
8128895 i wanted to get more into the individual aspects of working with students when youre teaching youre teaching a group of kids and that can be anywhere from 30 to 40 kids and you want to service everybody
8128896 some students have issues going on at home that theyre battling with and you can see the distraction in the classroom
8128897 we cant deal with a lot of the mental health issues because were so focused on getting students to graduate that we miss the social emotional pieces i thought that just by being here as a teacher for six years and then by being a counselor i would be able to change some of that but its bigger than me
8128898 as a teacher you cant really be involved in the larger picture the decision making
8128899 teaching candidates need to know what the work day is going to be like and that there are going to be frustrations and that theyre not going to be able to affect a lot of change
8128900 but i know how girls learn and i know that one of the key things that makes learning relevant for women and girls is having to do with anything that relates to people
8128901 salaries are low for teachers when compared to salaries for other professions and that lowers prestige and social value
8128902 i dont think you should go into it for the money but if teaching were somehow presented as a more lucrative career then maybe more men would go into it i wish society could shift their perception of what teachers do and how valuable they are
8128903 teachers stay because there is nothing more rewarding than helping children reach their potential its remarkable to see a child engage in learning and grow intellectually
8128904 you can go home feeling good about all the things you did with the thought that maybe you are the only person who has done something good for that child that day
8128905 the students ive worked with have been wonderful ive been fortunate to be able to work with students in difficult circumstances who would show up with big smiles on their faces happy to be at school

8128908 there are so many problems with vertical managing units with personnel financial material power concentrated in one person and in particular with absolute power over the appointment of cadres some metropolitan agencies cadres can be promoted only if money is paid over like plucking down from geese as they pass no hopers and crooks can be promoted while talented people are kept out of the leadership anyone stepping out of line is dealt with

8128922 painters like giotto and michelangelo have painted the history of italy the story of the renaissance i am small by comparison

8128924 if you make a mistake the only way to change it is to take an axe and pull it off the wall this sort of painting sorts the men from the boys
8128925 as the plaster dries the colours take on different shades the painting must begin immediately after the plaster is applied the painting must be exact and i must work fast
8128926 i have told some people to go away three or four times said the artist
8128927 ive tried various ways to tell them why they have not been chosen
8128928 i am looking for certain types of character in the casting sessions every face is studied carefully before the final selection is made
8128929 its a medieval nose perhaps it was also my stature
8128930 i will be painted in as part of the crowd that looks on as st ranierus performs one of his miracles
8128931 to be honest i dont really care where i am in the painting the fresco will be there for centuries to come and my face will be on that wall long after i have gone
8128932 with fresco painting like this there can be no mistakes
8128933 you put on your square of plaster you take a deep breath and you do it
8128934 and it doesnt matter if you are michelangelo or the badly paid assistant you just do it and you do it as quickly as you can
8128935 if you make a mistake the only way to change it is to take an axe and pull it off the wall this sort of painting sorts the men from the boys
8128936 but i take my hat off to him its wonderful that a young painter has the drive to do it and is prepared to take the risk
8128937 tender caring and words caress the world inverted and loves duress promises made and promises broken
8128938 our bodies lie entangled while our hearts are mangled bound by our love and devotion my fear and your emotion

8128940 no more broken promises no more call to war unless its love and peace that were really fighting for

8128990 on closer inspection the country we have inhabited for the last three decades seems more like a panorama of madness and delusion of sturdy patriots reciting the pledge while they resolutely strangle their own life chances of small farmers proudly voting themselves off the land of devoted family men carefully seeing to it that their children will never be able to afford college or proper health care of hardened blue collar workers in midwestern burgs cheering as they deliver up a landslide for a candidate whose policies will end their way of life

8129016 what kind of education revolution would cut money to public schools
8129017 its a 1 8 per cent decrease in real funding for public schools during the life of the next four year agreement
8129018 we are already boosting funding for education thats what our trades training centres in schools are all about thats what the digital revolution is all about
8129019 weve already started rolling out our 2 5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools our 1 2 billion investment in the digital education revolution and the list goes on
8129020 the last budget was a budget in which education was a centrepiece
8129021 we are in active negotiations about the schools funding agreement for the next four years and those negotiations will be announced through the council of australian governments process
8129022 im not going to allow an aeu report to derail that incredibly important set of negotiations
8129023 you will find on a yearly basis the funding is very small
8129024 we should not be conned by announcement that talk about funding over 10 year periods

8129064 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8129065 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8129066 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8129067 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8129068 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8129069 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8129070 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8129071 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8129072 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8129073 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8129074 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama

8129096 carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple effects of displacement intensification reorientation and modification of desire itself
8129097 we believe that this investigation of the irs is completely unfounded and politically motivated
8129098 there is a very clear effort national in scale to discredit defame and intimidate ministries and preachers of what has come to be called the
8129099 those behind these attacks we will for the moment only identify as enemies of the gospel often politically motivated they are fearful not only of the moral imperative communicated by these ministries but the growing wealth and influence of those constituencies in the natural world money is power and influence so a wealthy church individually and collectively is without question going to gain increasing visibility and influence in its city state and nation the opponents of christian ideology rightly understand that to limit our influence they must limit our growing wealth and to accomplish this goal they must undermine and corrupt the commitment of the donor base
8129100 the media allegations mean little or nothing if you keep the larger context in mind our individual level of wealth according to god eph 3 20 can potentially exceed what we can even ask or think limited only by the power of faith that works in us

8129142 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8129143 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8129144 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8129145 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8129146 with an agenda like that it make sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8129147 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8129148 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need
8129149 we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8129150 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republican or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8129151 im sure you remember a girl from kanas who said theres no place like home
8129152 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8129153 when it comes to the economy when it comes to job creation when it comes to health care reform or when it comes to deficit reduction there are three words that describe the bush mccain record mission not accomplished
8129154 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8129155 the number of yiddish books and brochures published annually in the soviet union steadily declining in 1921 1924 rose from 76 in 1924 to 168 in 1925 by 1930 it had reached 531
8129156 the survey shows religion in america is indeed 3 000 miles wide and only three inches deep
8129157 theres a growing pluralistic impulse toward tolerance and that is having theological consequences
8129158 i think that organized religion could find this also a little bit threatening in the sense when dogma and doctrine become less and less important it doesnt matter belonging to one church or another
8129159 many people who identify as atheists may not be telling us they dont believe in god they may be telling us they dont like organized religion
8129160 look this shows the limits of a survey approach to religion
8129161 what do people really mean when they say that many religions lead to eternal life
8129162 it is impossible for me to believe that christ is the only window for salvation
8129163 what most people are saying is hey we dont have a hammer lock on god or salvation and gods bigger than us and we should respect that and respect other people
8129164 some people are like butterflies that go from flower to flower going from religion to religion and frankly they dont get that deep into any of them
8129165 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
8129166 if by tolerance we mean were willing to engage or embrace a multitude of ways to salvation thats no longer evangelical belief
8129167 the word evangelical has been stretched so broadly its almost an elastic term
8129168 it shows increased religious security people are comfortable with other traditions even if theyre different
8129169 it indicates a level of humility about religion that would be of great benefit to everyone
8129170 the statistics show more than anything else that many who describe themselves as catholics do not know or understand the teachings of their church
8129171 being catholic means believing what the catholic church teaches it is a communion of faith not simply of ancestry and family tradition it also means that the church ought to work harder at evangelizing its own members
8129172 wal mart is not a company its an epidemic disease wal mart is one of the biggest factors in causing unemployment in the united states wal mart is your enemy its destroying our community it represents globalization it represents an institutionalization of the values which stink
8129173 if wal mart were a country it would rank ahead of great britain and russia in total imports
8129174 to be able to meet the demands from key customers like wal mart rubbermaid has to become competitive in price
8129175 as soon as egoism becomes the ruler of a people the bands of order are loosened and in the pursuit of their own happiness men fall from heaven into a real hell
8129176 the use of gas was strictly forbidden in the wehrmacht even the use of gas as answer to such bombs used against germany needed hitlers clearing no use of chemical weapons could be used without hitlers approval such weapons should only be stored inside germany
8129177 it is my intention not to wait too long before england shall use chemical weapons
8129178 churchill has ready to use chemical weapons should germany start an invation of england even though such weapons could harm the british 10
8129179 we know the huns which is the reason why we are keeping up our afford and why we are building up our storage of chemical weapons i would say that should germany again attack our ally soviet with more chemical weapons then we will start using such gas in our attacks on german cities and towns
8129180 using gas bombs after the axis countries have started the bombing
8129181 i want a cold blooded war effort to be started and the use of poisonous gas when we start this i do want everybody to go for it with all they got i want sound people to start the planning and not allow any psalm singer to stop us from what we are about to do
8129182 we can bomb the cities along the rhein and many other cities and towns so hard sprinkled with gas that most of the people will have to have medical care for the rest of their lives and we will do this by using poisonous gas

8129184 how can one be such a shining example of democracy at home and a frightening monster abroad
8129185 for while the zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a palestinian state the jews again slyly dupe the dumb goyim it doesnt even enter their heads to build up a jewish state in palestine for the purpose of living there all they want is a central headquarters for their international world swindle endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks
8129186 for me the jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people as far as my experience goes they are no better than other human groups although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power otherwise i cannot see anything chosen about them
8129187 its a bit of a monument in the desert right now because its not going to be used as a prison

8129212 today corporate social responsibility goes far beyond the old philanthropy of the past donating money to good causes at the end of the financial year and is instead an all year round responsibility that companies accept for the environment around them for the best working practices for their engagement in their local communities and for their recognition that brand names depend not only on quality price and uniqueness but on how cumulatively they interact with companies workforce community and environment now we need to move towards a challenging measure of corporate responsibility where we judge results not just by the input by its outcomes the difference we make to the world in which we live and the contribution we make to poverty reduction www csr gov uk 2004 p 2
8129213 we are committed to creating economic value but we are not indifferent to how we do it progressive businesses are gaining competitive advantage by responding to societal signals we prosper by helping society to prosper 2007

8129215 what do i really know about this nursing care situation
8129216 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
8129217 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8129218 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8129219 they are very mad but i explained that if we dont work for obama then we are disappointing hillary
8129220 im going to vote for her for historical purposes and to make a statement
8129221 i made a pledge to mrs clinton and im a woman of my word and women in america need to be recognized
8129222 im looking for the obama campaign to reach out and unite us all
8129223 they need after thursday to make sure obama contacts the delegates he needs to personally reach out
8129224 when you hire a ceo its not just because he has a smile you need the resume sometimes you take a chance but im cautious she said adding that she might sit out the general election
8129225 you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8129226 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8129227 they are not moving over to obama and probably wont even if hillary goes all out
8129228 get over it if you care about the things that ive fought for all my life is the only one to bring those things into law
8129229 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8129230 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and
8129231 mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been a part of the middle class said ohio gov
8129232 and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
8129233 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past he said
8129234 unless mr peters can provide a credible explanation on the owen glenn saga
8129235 as long as the people of europe like to eat every day they will come to us
8129236 none of us can afford to be on the sidelines
8129237 we dont need four more years of the last eight years mccain and bush makes perfect sense theyll be in the twin cities awfully hard to tell them apart
8129238 i am honoured to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8129239 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8129240 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8129241 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8129242 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single american
8129243 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks it is okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8129244 district residents risked their lives in battle in iraq and afghanistan
8129245 what he was doing rather than criticizing bush he was comparing the difference between him and sen barack obama
8129246 and saying we do not want to see more of the same in the next election which is what we could get if mccain wins
8129247 i look at this downturn as a tremendous opportunity to collectively examine as a community where we are where we are going and how we can continue to make sure that were a strong county
8129248 the housing market is in the tubes people are giving their cars away and people are not spending money
8129249 those three categories close to 80 percent of our revenue are flat and negative
8129250 the challenge before us is so daunting that we dont really have a choice
8129251 it came out of the blue im disappointed if any adult takes advantage of his or her position as a teacher and role model she was popular and she produced a good yearbook she seemed like a regular teacher
8129252 duarte stated she could not remember when she gave student a cocaine
8129253 however she believes it was approximately one week after she gave cocaine to student b
8129254 this is still very much an ongoing investigation to find out if there are any other incidents
8129255 left a highly successful business career in marketing to return to her first love english
8129256 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8129257 its the destruction of a human life this teaching has not changed and remains unchanged
8129258 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8129259 knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them abortion is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8129260 never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8129261 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8129262 were seeing more of that in recent years than perhaps we saw in the past
8129263 when you have very prominent individuals in the public square who are eager to identify themselves as catholics the bishops want to make sure that the people understand that quote unquote celebrities dont get a pass when it comes to the teachings or the practices of the church
8129264 i am so honored to be here tonight no i am here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and non of us can afford to sit on the sidelines it is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months and endured the last 8 years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8129265 never gave in never gave up and we made history together
8129266 those are the women who allowed my daughter to vote for me for president of the united states
8129267 john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we do not need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation and less affordable care more high gas prices and less alternative energy more jobs shipped overseas and less jobs created here at home more skyrocketing debt home foreclosures and mounting debt more war and less diplomacy
8129268 it is obvious why john and george bush will be in the twin cities because it is harder and harder to tell them apart
8129269 we the democrats are a completely different because of barack obama and joe bidens policies
8129270 have you ever been in love horrible isnt it it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up you build up all these defenses you build up a whole suit of armor so that nothing can hurt you then one stupid person no different from any other stupid person wanders into your stupid life you give them a piece of you they didnt ask for it they did something dumb one day like kiss you or smile at you and then your life isnt your own anymore love takes hostages it gets inside you it eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness so simple a phrase like maybe we should be just friends turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart it hurts not just in the imagination not just in the mind its a soul hurt a real gets inside you and rips you apart pain i hate love
8129271 i have found the paradox that if i love until it hurts then there is no hurt but only more love

8129303 an ingenious study just published in the journal of consumer research has provided a striking demonstration that taste perceptions and product preferences are strongly influenced by our personal values to the point where people who believe in the importance of social authority perceived a sausage roll labelled as vegetarian as far inferior to a meat version even though they ate the same sausage roll on both occasions the same result appeared whether the participants actually ate meat or vegetarian sausage rolls and the participants couldnt reliably distinguish the two in any condition

8129312 with your permission lady i will fetch her a nightdress and some clothes for the morning
8129313 they cut it whenever i was in the hospital lately i just borrowed a pair of scissors from the counter ladies
8129314 i dont know just seems like youve probably had a pretty shitty time of it
8129315 what do you want me to say gwenfer that i hate you secretly i dont that im jealous amazingly im relatively secure in my relationship with my husband yes it does rankle a little that you gave him the heir i dont seem to be able to but its not like you had an option or that it was your choice and im certainly not jealous of you spending 2 decades wandering homeless around dc with people thinking you were nuts parts of my life have sucked but ive never had a 20 year spell of suckage thank god
8129316 as if id take care of another and let you fend for yourself
8129317 he is feeling much better and thank the goddess it appears that none of the others have come down with it turn your head this way please lady
8129318 vivo has started running and much like his namesake will not stop moving
8129319 before you know it hell be going to school and pestering for a sword like jem is
8129320 i mean to tell you this the last time we were speaking of it but if you want id be happy to help any of the children with preliminary swordwork until theyre old enough to study with master roberts
8129321 your life here has been marked by one tumult after another youve been injured or banished for probably three quarters of the time youve been here no wonder your poor body hasnt felt it can conceive now this woman from the lords school days reappears and not just any woman the mother of his heir its best to have a secondary heir as we all know to our sorrow how easily people pass to the goddesss care whats to say that he wont set you aside and wed her to provide lakosha with what it needs or worse conceive a second child with her
8129322 it is good of you to be concerned but theres no need to be
8129323 she thinks he will she thinks youre being kind to her to protect your own position i tried to tell her you werent like that
8129324 so thats what that comment was about i wondered why you felt the need to enumerate my few positive qualities
8129325 you offer so much to lakosha and ask so little in return
8129326 dont you think thats a little harsh on the poor woman
8129327 is it she wished to be associated with her remember its easy to forget that part in the wake of the end result she has suffered definitely but she feels shes owed something for it i can feel it she thinks she can sway the lord from your side where he belongs
8129328 even if it means my throne i know where my home truly lies
8129329 so while i really appreciate the fact that you worry about me this time you dont have to worry
8129330 its going to be fine the goddess wont let us down
8129331 its one of the nicer ones gwenfer is wearing my only clean plain one
8129332 come to bed dear one tomorrow is soon enough to worry
8129333 why is everyone so concerned did i fuck up i couldnt leave her there that wouldnt have been fair
8129334 you didnt fuck up genny you did the only thing that an honorable person could do id expect no less of you
8129335 the concern is complex as weve talked about gwenfer and i broke no laws not even upon gwens birth yet there is definitely a societal stigma to the situation when gwenfer was thought dead it was easy to avoid yet here she is and a living breathing mother of the heir to the throne were we not already married society would demand that i marry her
8129336 but we are married i remember it quite distinctly and hey look matching wedding bands
8129337 we are indeed and despite everything quite happily yet particularly given the various issues weve already had arise there will likely be some new pressure for me to set you aside and marry gwenfer instead
8129338 is the fertility issue as important as mara seems to think and be honest please
8129339 as if youd let me get away with not being honest
8129340 im sure that even in your world youve heard the term an heir and a spare it is no different here
8129341 as mara pointed out it has been a tumultuous period since your arrival here and our son is dead only just over a year your body has been used and abused youve almost died on more than one occasion and i have been absent from you physically or emotionally far too many months of our marriage
8129342 i have not however given up hope of another child swelling your belly
8129343 dont fret my own as i told mara you are my home even if it means the crown well discuss it in the morning with will and others but for now sleep
8129344 if i rise on the wings of the dawn if i settle on the far side of the sea 10 even there our hand will guide me your right hand will hold me fast
8129345 one day jesus said to his disciples lets go over to the other side of the lake
8129346 he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters the storm subsided and all was calm
8129347 who is this he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him
8129348 you lord are my shepherd i will never be in need 2 you let me rest in fields of green grass you lead me to streams of peaceful water 3 and you refresh my life
8129349 there was nothing attractive about him nothing to cause us to take a second look he was looked down on and passed over a man who suffered who knew pain firsthand one look at him and people turned away we looked down on him we thought he was scum
8129350 but the fact is it was our pains he carried our disfigurements all the things wrong with us we thought he brought it on himself that god was punishing him for his own failures but it was our sins that did that to him that ripped and tore and crushed him our sins he took the punishment and that made us whole and by his stripes we are healed
8129351 but i trust in you o lord i say you are my god
8129352 o lord my god i called to you for help and you healed me
8129353 hearing this jesus said to jairus dont be afraid just believe and she will be healed
8129354 my god will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in christ jesus philippians 4 19
8129355 but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
8129356 then jesus came to them and said all power in heaven and on earth is given to me
8129357 god made the world and everything in it he is lord of heaven and earth and he doesnt live in temples built by human hands 25 he doesnt need help from anyone he gives life breath and everything else to all people

8129448 fact is the philippines has an outstanding sovereignty claim over the island state of sabah which is owned by the sultanate of sulu accoding to malaysia which exercises sovereignty over the disputed island state finds it cheaper to bankroll a rebellion than go to war with a neighbor known for it innovations and skills in combat tactics in spite of being ill equipped on the other hand gluttony and the greed for cash which has been plaguing the leadership of the milf appears to be enough for them to fight a proxy war in favor of malaysia over the island state of sabah if only to succeed in grabbing back the land and all the improvements introduced on them by settlers from the north to whom they have earlier sold their properties by fighting this war the milf is in effect providing malaysia an effective buffer a shield against any attempt by the philippine government to pursue its sovereignty claim over sabah

8129456 if there is anything everyone knows about lauren if she can play through it she does youve seen that with her shins i know shes had shoulder problems ankle problems shes a pretty tough kid
8129457 we still have a lot of talent left on this team and were in a very good situation a half game back in the west
8129458 i understand lauren jackson is an amazing player and one that cant be replaced but collectively we have been trying to pick up the slack and now that shes gone i definitely have to look to score a little more
8129459 the period of time we played without lauren will not hurt us in this situation
8129460 i think were a team thats still evolving jacksons quality of player is not only shown at the offensive end but defensive end
8129461 so i think that theres a void that will need to be filled on both ends but i also think we have people who can step up in their own way and fill that void
8129462 i will state and i will state to you that in the next few days i am going to evaluate and that does not necessarily mean to evaluate to get surgery it means to evaluate my different options and whats the best for me medically in the long term not just here before the playoffs

8129487 hes got to go in and play take over the team and well go from there
8129488 he played a big role in the alamo bowl last year and did pretty well then
8129489 both of them can run the same offense but their strengths are different

8129495 the value of an asset is the money equivalent of its service potentials conceptually this is the sum of the future market prices of all streams of service to be derived discounted to their present worth however this conception of value is an abstraction which yields but limited practical basis for quantification consequently the measurement of assets is commonly made by other more feasible means non monetary assets are typically stated at acquisition cost or some derivative thereof
8129496 the value of the subject asset is the present value of the expected economic income to be earned from the ownership of the subject intangible asset
8129497 globalization is good and you just have to explain it to people technology is good and if you are quiet and patient for a couple of decades everybody will begin
8129498 i can tell youre admiring my febrility i know its appealing i practise at it every woman loves an invalid i bring out the florence nightingale in them but be careful y ou might do something destructive hunger is more basic than love florence nightingale was a cannibal you know
8129499 but its wonderful every time it just seems to get better one of the things that makes this even better this time is that i know what im getting into ive had so much experience in this job and i dont think there will be any surprises for me when i go to the city and i really look forward to hopefully a seamless transition as we move from one administration to another
8129500 i thank the voters and consider this as a very defining moment in our history this is in pursuant to the clamour and demand for change that you have seen during the march 8 general election
8129501 i will take the oath discuss and meet with the pakatan leaders first and then announce the next step

8129507 yeah thats the star whos gonna take this character to the next level
8129508 the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8129509 the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial
8129510 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word
8129511 they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused
8129512 ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again
8129513 people think we broke up or are returning after some time off
8129514 kevin just wasnt into recording the 2005 album never gone in a creative way there were disagreements on every direction the band was taking and he left because he realized he was hurting the group
8129515 with him gone there dont seem to be as many conflicts we arent bumping heads anymore and things are flowing better musically
8129516 there can be no room for doubt four is the strongest we are the backstreet boys
8129517 which sold more than a million copies in its debut week and was that years top selling album
8129518 working hard to prove ourselves isnt something we arent familiar with
8129519 on the one hand radio stations arent playing us as much as they used to but then again we know how it feels to see something begin to build again
8129520 i was thrown into the whole reality tv world before i should have been i had issues i had to go through and unfortunately i went through them on television
8129521 i saw myself on television in an unhealthy state both physically and mentally it opened my eyes
8129522 i stopped drinking i got back in shape it took me two years but ive changed my life around
8129523 operational level system of fixed command and control and infrastructure
8129524 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8129525 i am a 44 year old female battling a daily uncontrollable gas problem this is so embarrassing i have quit going to social events or anywhere quiet like church services ive tried watching what i eat but it seems that everything causes trouble maybe i should just stop eating
8129526 i had a huge problem with gas after returning from a trip to turkey where i caught some type of intestinal bug after nine months of horrible gas i finally tried your remedy of fennel which ended the problem
8129527 having gas like this can ruin a persons life the stress and worry that accompany the problem actually change who you are as a person it affects friendships and sleep patterns and gives you a feeling of loss of hope or even serious depression
8129528 i couldnt explain to people why i could not eat at a luncheon or why i had to leave quickly after eating lunch with them or why i could not attend meetings this was too embarrassing for me
8129529 i could not talk about it with other people when i tried all i heard from my doctor my best friend and my daughter was that gas is normal i felt toward the end that no one understood how bad the gas was thank you so much for writing about fennel
8129530 i have had a chronic problem with flatulence and had given up hope that i would ever find anything to help ive lived on a very simple diet for many years making my own sourdough bread with white organic flour because my body cant handle whole grains
8129531 in an experiment i put some caraway seeds into my bread before i baked it lo and behold the flatulence disappeared it hasnt troubled me for two years now and my acne rosacea has also cleared up what relief
8129532 there are a number of places where the trailers are extensively damaged one i saw was completely demolished
8129533 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
8129534 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
8129535 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
8129536 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
8129537 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
8129538 its 100 feet by 100 feet but it sits at a very important corner
8129539 we want to be able to landscape it and incorporate it into the adjacent parcel which is the loft condominium parcel
8129540 povertys down incomes are up and health coverage is basically stagnant except for children where weve seen dramatic decreases
8129541 but we still have some of the worst poverty in the country
8129542 who are trying to make ends meet but need a little incentive
8129543 the state needs to make a concerted effort to help stabilize private employee health plans
8129544 i see no reason to be a gang member or to take someone elses life for the purpose of being a tough guy
8129545 there was a lot of emotions a lot of things that go through our heads things that you never imagined sadness emptiness um depression
8129546 but it begins a process more awareness neighborhood watch programs coming out of this parental responsibility coming to the floor student recognizing and being held accountable for their actions
8129547 i dont have my kids but i know theyre ok i know they are in a place where they dont suffer no more and i keep in touch with them every single minute thru my heart and my soul
8129548 well what the fuck what am i supposed to eat
8129549 please let me know if i can assist the agency during the transition period
8129550 the board was not given accurate information and was kept out of the loop on several things
8129551 especially in those of people who decided to leave their country behind
8129552 when i was asked to do this opera i was happy to turn over the story
8129553 i wasnt thinking that i would be committing myself to doing a libretto
8129554 its a very free form as a matter of fact
8129555 it wasnt about cutting back the novel but rather to find the heart of the story and recreate it all over again
8129556 a combination of these things really help us out with the budget cuts were about to embark on for 08 09
8129557 how do you prevent people from putting content in yet another repository that could likely create problems with adhering to the records retention policies in place in the firms
8129558 if wikis are used for content regarding a matter and the firm were to determine how to deal with the records retention policy issue isnt there still a risk management issue
8129559 we seem to be doing a lot more than other states
8129560 with the population exploding and the corrections budget ever smaller prison conditions within the states department of corrections have deteriorated dramatically in recent years
8129561 there has been no accountability to the taxpayers who fund the system the employees who work in the prisons or the individuals who are incarcerated in them
8129562 our concern with the department of corrections is the complete lack of funding corrections is already cut to the bone
8129563 rather than take responsibility for the lack of funding the legislature sought to pass the buck onto the director
8129564 it is easy and tempting to blame your immediate superiors your senior leadership or this agency for low pay low staffing crowded prisons and insufficient equipment however all of those problems are controlled by lawmakers
8129565 overall my experience with ozmint has been hes been a straight shooter
8129566 youre always going to have complaints and youre always going to have criticism that you could do it better
8129567 and a search of the residence is required to gather further information as to the cause and origin
8129568 the fourth amendment prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure trumps those needs
8129569 cancer is a disease of damaged dna and uncontrolled cell reproduction
8129570 the greater the degree of inflammation response could lead to increased risk of cancer
8129571 were going all the way to the end we have everybody here with metal detectors
8129572 wait its not about that deaths these days are far more violent carnage for carnages sake
8129573 oh i wasnt actually dead even though you all saw me die
8129574 were hopefully going to continue to pick up the pace
8129575 its no surprise to see voucher advocates focus on that and refuse to acknowledge that south carolinas scores have improved faster than any other state over the past 10 years
8129576 im sure well have comments on it again im sure others will too
8129577 we know some right whales are most likely calving off south carolina
8129578 we understand fully this is a large action with a lot of implications we dont take this action lightly but we do feel its necessary
8129579 its a great opportunity to share a slice of life in small town america in the midst of an engaging democratic process
8129580 im sure well learn a lot in the process and so will arabs about us
8129581 i used to be real hard on myself more than anything but then i just came to the realization that theres no way a person comes in and sits with me for a period of at the most 15 or 20 minutes and all of a sudden i can just change their world i cant do that
8129582 when i hire people i know theyre not going to be here for a lifetime
8129583 if i can get two years out of them im grateful
8129584 i dont think anyone could have envisioned the kind of numbers or the staggering amount of violence that were seeing here in the charleston area
8129585 we all do the best we can but at the end of the day these people are at home in the community
8129586 jika perjanjian dapat dimuktamadkan bulan ini beberapa penyelidik dari usm pulau pinang akan ditempatkan di pulau banding rainforest research centre mulai bulan depan bagi memulakan kajian mengenai spesies ikan yang semakin berkurangan di royal belum
8129587 selepas berjaya membiak benih ikan seperti kelah temoleh dan tengalan kita akan melepaskan anak ikan di beberapa sungai utama sekitar tasik banding dan tasik temenggor
8129588 dengan cara ini kami dapat membantu orang asli menambah pendapatan dengan menjual ikan yang lebih besar
8129589 dulu boleh dapat ikan besar sekarang ikan kecil saja tak boleh jual untuk makan sendiri bolehlah
8129590 perbezaan rm23 52 itu semakin ketara apabila ada peneroka kelas b yang menghantar sawit mereka melebihi 10 tan kerana hasil kebun sawit mereka jauh lebih tinggi daripada hasil kebun yang dimajukan oleh felda sendiri
8129591 tindakan kilang sawit felda itu seperti menggalakkan peneroka untuk menghantar buah sawit ke kilang swasta yang akhirnya akan merugikan kilang sawit felda sendiri
8129592 dalam usia tujuh hari dengan saiz sebesar siling 20 sen anak ketam membesar sehingga matang dalam tempoh dua bulan atau 80 hari dengan berat 500 hingga 600 gram seekor dalam tempoh itu anak ketam diberi makanan ikan baja dan pallet sekali dalam sehari
8129593 dalam tempoh itu juga disiplin pemberian makanan perlu dititikberatkan kerana ketam yang lapar boleh menyerang antara satu sama lain
8129594 pada masa sama ketam yang bersalin kulit perlu diasing bagi mengelakkan ia dimakan ketam lain memandangkan kulitnya yang lembut
8129595 ia pasti menjimatkan dan keselamatan ternakan dapat dikawal berbanding jika diternak dalam kolam tanah atau batu
8129596 penyertaan dikenakan bayaran rm200 seorang dan peserta akan diberi penerangan mengenai ternakan ketam nipah prospek perniagaan dan peluang pasaran
8129597 pada masa yang sama kami turut menawarkan kepakaran dan menjual peralatan yang diperlukan bagi menternak ketam kepada bakal penternak
8129598 selain menjual benih ketam dan makanan kami juga membeli ketam ketam dewasa berkenaan dengan harga rm28 sekilogram dalam erti kata lain penternak tidak perlu risau akan hasil ternakan mereka kerana kami yang mencari pasarannya
8129599 sekurang kurangnya dengan mengamalkan sistem tangkap dan lepas generasi akan datang masih boleh melihat spesies ini suatu hari nanti
8129600 memang benar ikan banyak di sungai tetapi kalau tiada keinsafan dalam diri betapa pentingnya memuliharanya bekalan akan berkurangan kita juga akan rugi apabila sungai di negara ini tiada lagi spesies kelah mendiaminya
8129601 tidak dinafikan ketika bertarung ada juga ikan bersaiz ini mati kerana terlalu lama jadi ikan ini kita ambil dan dimasak di dalam hutan untuk dimakan bukannya dibawa pulang ke rumah
8129602 kelah di sini suka makan kelapa sawit tua yang berminyak dan pantang dilempar ke air sudah pasti disambar begitu juga memancing di sini tidak perlu menggunakan batu ladung kerana dikhuatiri mengganggu kedamaian air sungai berkenaan dan kelah akan lari bersembunyi
8129603 kita jangka jawatankuasa pembangunan industri herba dapat diwujudkan sebelum akhir tahun ini
8129604 laporan kajian industri herba oleh fama juga dijangka siap sebelum akhir tahun ini dan akan menjadi panduan kepada pemain industri itu untuk mengambil langkah ke arah meletakkan herba negara mampu menembusi pasaran global
8129605 kita harap dengan ada jawatankuasa yang akan memberi perhatian kepada pembangunan industri herba itu juga dapat membantu usahawan kecil yang terbabit dalam perniagaan produk herba
8129606 oleh itu pihak membuat kajian dan institusi penyelidikan tumbuhan dan pemakanan perlu peka kepada kesan sampingan dan memaklumkan kepada kerajaan mengambil langkah sewajarnya
8129607 satu piawaian bersesuaian produk herba juga perlu dibangunkan bagi menyokong pasaran industri herba negara pada peringkat global
8129608 listening to her i thought she could be president of the united states

8129623 as a democrat i hope mccain doesnt pick a woman vp
8129624 amigos es tiempo de rescatar el pa s que amamos y no importa si votaron por mi o si votaron por barack es hora de unirnos como un partido nico con un prop sito nico estamos en el mismo equipo y ninguno de nosotros puede hacerse a un lado sta es una pelea por el futuro y es una lucha que debemos de ganar barack obama es mi candidato
8129625 ese atentado a la legalidad constitucional y a la vida democr tica obliga a reasumir el ejercicio de la soberan a popular y abolir de una vez y para siempre el r gimen de corrupci n y privilegios que impera en el pa s por eso aunque no les guste a mis adversarios al diablo con sus instituciones
8129626 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8129627 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8129628 john mccain is my colleague and my friend clinton said
8129629 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8129630 we will someday launch a woman into the white house
8129631 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up
8129632 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8129633 promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real strategy to invest in our crumbling infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8129634 gagged by california democratic leaders allred complained that she and other clinton delegates were being denied the right to hold formal meetings and speak out
8129635 we want to have an opportunity to vote what they want to do with us is to vote by acclamation its very unfair it shouldnt be like this
8129636 a lot of women who are very disappointed because they feel like this will be the only time in their lifetime that they see a woman able to have the nomination for president
8129637 this is largely much ado about nothing significant i will admit to you that i was disappointed a lot of people were disappointed but we are a family and families have family fights but ill tell you what brings families together is an outside threat
8129638 i dont expect all the strong hillary supporters to be strong supporters for obama
8129639 theres a small group of women who are devoted to hillary personally and to the idea of having a woman elected president who are having a difficult time not having that dream becoming a reality but today we will address that respect it and move on
8129640 i worked for her in 11 states and if it moved me to support obama it should move anyone
8129641 im hoping that will help get the clinton supporters behind obama
8129642 she transferred her mission and purpose to the election of brack obama
8129643 i think the party officially united and is ready to battle
8129644 hoy tendr an que venir a inaugurar buena parte del ave
8129645 nos jugamos mucho a ade se puede repetir la triste historia de ser la ltima comunidad con conexi n del ave a la meseta igual que ocurri con las autov as
8129646 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please take care of me
8129647 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8129648 im sure those people will say ok i have to do the liberty bell independence hall cheesesteaks the rocky statue and the comcast screen
8129649 its just amazing how many people come flocking to this thing with smiles on their faces
8129650 to capture the 20 second audience in transit and get a smile on their face is unbelievably rewarding
8129651 we went for this because we wanted to create something that would be very high technology in our building that would communicate the high technology business that were in
8129652 when you go into lots of media companies very often you see televisions in their lobbies big screens with network content on it we thought that we wanted to do something more sophisticated than that
8129653 and now there are thousands of people coming in to see the wall shop to visit the cafe fountain or just hang around
8129654 theres a certain thing that people would expect to see up on a screen like that
8129655 and weve gone to great lengths to create the unexpected
8129656 one of the things that we sensed was that students were not as engaged at the university as students were at other universities
8129657 we wanted to have some sort of intensive program that would really connect them to the university connect them with each other and connect them with the faculty and staff
8129658 contrary to what i hear a lot of institutions are doing
8129659 the movement generally across the country has been to reduce the amount of time between when students are allowed to move in and when classes actually start what weve found is that the more time you give the students the more time they have to see minneapolis in ways you might not want them to see minneapolis
8129660 we really thought about how we can get the students on campus give them the content they need and help them make the connections without it being a drinking fest
8129661 dorms food service transportation this all has to be paid for
8129662 its related to graduation because its going to connect students much earlier on with the array of opportunities they can have culturally socially or academically at the university that engagement and as quick as you can do it is really key to success in college today
8129663 research shows that the more the student is involved and engaged in student activities in leadership positions the better theyll do in their academic work and the sooner theyll graduate
8129664 thats not always self evident but we want to introduce them to these opportunities so maybe theyll realize gee maybe i should balance some of these outside the classroom opportunities
8129665 the fy08 result confirmed our belief that diversification is finally paying off
8129666 our research shows that a reduction of staff numbers does not necessarily have a negative impact on editorial quality
8129667 our proprietary research on the australian research sic sector has revealed fxjs metro mastheads as laggards among their peers when it comes to editorial productivity levels

8129693 we are required now to work together for the good of our country in the days ahead we must find common cause we must join in common effort without remorse or recrimination without anger or rancor america is in need of unity and longing for a larger measure of compassion
8129694 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together

8129700 well that means that ill walk this december and those last three classes that got cut in the summer term will have to be picked up for next semester
8129701 with the budget cuts has come pain has come less class sections less part time instructors were trying wherever we can to minimize the effect on students
8129702 its difficult because when there are more kids in the class you get less one on one with your teacher and with your professor

8129711 australia has a bid to host the 2018 world cup
8129712 we have asked our officials to prepare a joint plan of action dealing with the range of interests and issues that we have
8129713 our relations are growing fast they are much more modest than they should be in terms of trade
8129714 but i am glad to see that investment is growing and it is on both sides
8129715 we appreciate very much the work being done by australia in terms of law and order and also support of the united nations
8129716 what kind of education revolution would cut money to public schools
8129717 its a 1 8 per cent decrease in real funding for public schools during the life of the next four year agreement
8129718 we are already boosting funding for education thats what our trades training centres in schools are all about thats what the digital revolution is all about
8129719 weve already started rolling out our 2 5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools our 1 2 billion investment in the digital education revolution and the list goes on
8129720 the last budget was a budget in which education was a centrepiece
8129721 we are in active negotiations about the schools funding agreement for the next four years and those negotiations will be announced through the council of australian governments process
8129722 im not going to allow an aeu report to derail that incredibly important set of negotiations
8129723 you will find on a yearly basis the funding is very small
8129724 we should not be conned by announcement that talk about funding over 10 year periods
8129725 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8129726 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8129727 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8129728 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8129729 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8129730 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8129731 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8129732 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage
8129733 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8129734 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8129735 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8129736 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8129737 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8129738 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8129739 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8129740 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8129741 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8129742 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8129743 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8129744 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8129745 i think that hillary clinton supporters are smarter than that if f they wanted hillary to be president they sure dont want mccain to be president
8129746 they made a promise theyre representing us the voters and they need to do the job that they were elected to do
8129747 if theyre pledge delegates for hillary clinton they need not to be pressured to give up that vote
8129748 once our warehouses were full we had to rent a badminton court just to store them
8129749 it has cost us a lot of money to launder and store the clothes so we decided it would be better just to auction them
8129750 just a week after the quake we told people to stop sending us secondhand clothes but they kept on coming
8129751 people would just dump them on the ground and leave we received as many clothes in the three months after the quake as we had in the past three years
8129752 ibms ballarat expansion will be a major boost for the local economy with the investment to increase education and skills in the region
8129753 over the next five years it will create 300 jobs and is expected to contribute an additional 61 million to the regions economy
8129754 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1 350 employees across 30 enterprises
8129755 clearly what were seeing is the economy is growing at a slower rate and some companies are laying off staff but other companies are actually taking advantage of victorias economy and creating jobs
8129756 are in pollution control clean energy generation and fuel cell technology in addition work is under way on the use of gold in cancer treatment
8129757 anti gravity propulsion is now coming out of the closet
8129758 even people could be transported by sending enough classical information
8129759 since the inception of the dna crime lab in san diego california over 592 crimes have been solved by dna match but one puzzling case remains a mystery may 16 2003 a 30 year old white male identified only as chris doe was arrested on burglary charges in la county and later released on 1 000 bail chris doe has a positive dna match to the shroud of turin he is now wanted for questioning by the authorities and by the scientific community
8129760 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8129761 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8129762 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8129763 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8129764 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8129765 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8129766 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8129767 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8129768 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8129769 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8129770 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8129771 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
8129772 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
8129773 the seriousness of such failures could be beyond the stretch of peoples imagination
8129774 you should do well at making money and holding on to it
8129775 any doubts that you may have will disappear early this month
8129776 get your mind set confidence will lead you on to success
8129777 what the mind can concieve and believe it can achieve
8129778 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8129779 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8129780 n o gostar e ter pregui a mas ir mesmo assim
8129781 theyre just a start up how can they hope to accomplish anything
8129782 on one would be like flash forward some 9 months and i work full time on a macbook pro developing with some of the most technologies out there the only thing holding me back to windows for the longest time was the games and i find now that most of my
8129783 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8129784 i dont think theres any way that he can avoid it i think he must too many people came to the polls armed with hammers to break that glass ceiling clintons candidacy meant too much to too many people especially american woman to let that go its too important a subtext a question i posed to tom brokaw chuck todd and peggy noonan if not hillary clinton then who if not now when its been a generation since geraldine ferraro when you look at the percentage of the population and look at the year were having here i think that is the part of the barack obama speech that had better be very very well crafted for a mass audience
8129785 we only have four returning starters but we think that were still sitting pretty for this season
8129786 we have a lot of guys that got a lot of reps last season and our freshman team was also very good last year
8129787 i dont think theres going to be any kind of hangover for this team
8129788 we realize how close we were last year but we have turned the page and were ready for more success this season
8129789 our conference is very tough and it is better than some of the 4a leagues
8129790 but for now youve got to put falcon pueblo county and pueblo central at the top
8129791 we have a lot of new kids and a big freshman class this season
8129792 but a lot of our kids are experienced and we should be able to make some noise
8129793 every conference game is going to be a battle this season
8129794 ive only seen two 8 man football games in my life
8129795 i feel pretty good about the players i have im not worried about how they will perform but i am concerned about how ill do i have no history in 8 man to base it off of ill be watching a lot of tapes to get prepared
8129796 hes got the strongest arm ive seen in a long while
8129797 we can compete in speed with guys like michael carl
8129798 its the defensive part that worries me most im not sure what kind of defense will work and be sound enough against our opponents
8129799 well be really competitive this year and im expecting big things this season
8129800 this is the first season i really believe that we have a shot at the postseason
8129801 this is probably as much depth as ive had coming back in 23 years as a head coach
8129802 we had a really good offseason had kids that worked really hard we feel really good about the senior class we have
8129803 were going to feature one of the premier defensive players in the league devyn harris
8129804 weve got a couple of good young d tackles every kid is excited about playing every coach is excited about coaching
8129805 were not sure where we stack up with everybody else around the city and around the state
8129806 its just so hard at the start of the season to find out where you measure up and find out what youve got
8129807 we run the true triple option so he is reading defenses and thats tough
8129808 not too much has gone right for us so far this year
8129809 weve been to the state playoffs twice while ive coached here and won a game both times you would think success would be a catalyst for more success but thats not happening here
8129810 a lot of kids are scared of getting hurt playing football and only want to play one or two specialized sports
8129811 we need the best possible athletes in the school on the football field to keep up with burlington and limon
8129812 there is a big gap between eighth and ninth grade here as far as the number of kids that come out for football
8129813 we have been successful with taking players and plugging them into our system and winning games
8129814 but this year we dont have the numbers we would like to
8129815 our league will have many young teams this year and most of us are rebuilding
8129816 however florence will not be rebuilding they never have to
8129817 we want to win the league championship and then see how far we can go in the playoffs every year
8129818 however there are many very good teams in this league and manitou is the defending champion so we will have to play well every week and hopefully improve with each game
8129819 florence is always very tough but there are four or five teams in this league that could make a run at it
8129820 manitou st marys cscs and trinidad are all going to be in the mix as well
8129821 all we try to do is make the kids better with every game and go forward we have respect for all of the teams in this league
8129822 this league is so competitive every year and we get so few playoff spots
8129823 it makes it fun and every game is very important
8129824 we believe that the facts will show that the complaining party has told different versions of what occurred and that the evidence will actually show that no assault occurred
8129825 at this point in time the alleged photographs have not been found to my knowledge
8129826 the police department has always been one of my main concerns
8129827 i feel like they are our first line of defense
8129828 jacobs well is a regional and statewide natural wonder that is cherished by this community

8129844 traditionally the culture sector has been recognized for its multi faceted role in contributing to individual and community development social cohesion and quality of life
8129845 however in recent decades there has been growing understanding and examination of the substantial economic contribution of arts and cultural industries and of their central role in the creative economy
8129846 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognize that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8129847 suggests that canadian gdp growth in the second quarter was likely somewhat weaker than expected
8129848 the recent decline in the spot and future prices of energy means that the temporary spike in total cpi inflation between now and the first quarter of 2009 should be lower than projected in the july update
8129849 there are publication bans so i cant discuss what happened in court today
8129850 its not for me to be talking about it when its before the courts
8129851 was shocked to hear about the allegations brought against mr meinzer effective immediately he has been suspended without pay from my office until such time as the matter has been dealt with by the proper authorities in a court of law
8129852 weve talked on and off about his career aspirations but that public office is not on his career map right now
8129853 they identify lonely vulnerable people and then request money from them with false promises of marriage or the release of vast sums of money at a later date
8129854 im disappointed in all of you for taking the easy way out
8129855 you know this means youll have seven years of no sex
8129856 we have a lot of big plans for mass effect having a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to mass effect 2
8129857 the child sex offender is a person in our neighbourhood and so are children and the police
8129858 if we victimise one person and create them as outcasts we arent addressing the risk
8129859 in that case the judge found there was a reasonable expectation of privacy particularly of his photo and home address
8129860 the judge took the strong view that if you share information along these lines you create more likelihood that the person goes on to reoffend
8129861 the experts evidence was that if he was managed properly the risk would be reduced there was no evidence he was reverting to risky behaviour
8129862 if we rely on convictions solely we do not have a strategy as a community to protect our community

8129864 in the four weeks of july and the first week of august we scheduled about 2800 league games from age 10 upwards we played 217 thats the extent of problem
8129865 the scarcity of grounds means that each individual pitch gets a lot of use each weekend so even when the grounds are not totally closed restrictions on use mean that we cant play our full programme
8129866 were playing in what in an average winter might be regarded as marginal conditions to get people a game and therefore that is making a mess of some of the fields
8129867 another situation is that theyve not been able to get on the grounds to mow which means its holding moisture and not drying as fast as it would do
8129868 wellington does feel it pretty hard were under tremendous grounds pressure particularly in wellington city region and even in a good year so weve been particularly hard hit
8129869 weve had weekends where weve had just six single pitches for one game each available across the entire region
8129870 were damned if we do damned if we dont at times weve pushed the boundaries of that more than we would normally just to try and get some football played
8129871 it is quite possibly the worst for us in living memory
8129872 obviously they have drainage built into them when they are constructed and you can play numerous games on them
8129873 one artificial pitch is going in this summer and there are papers going before council about the best places to put more in later this year
8129874 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid

8129881 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that

8129883 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8129884 some mornings just to get to the archdale building it takes 30 to 45 minutes which is just ridiculous because there are thousands of cars trying to get downtown
8129885 this right here the constant flow people can get anywhere they want to go at whatever time whether they work early or late or whatever that is the convenience plus it is fast buses arent quite as fast as this rail system
8129886 absolutely i would pay it i would gladly pay it and all the people i know would because it is safe yes i would be more than willing to pay
8129887 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8129888 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
8129889 our sales have been on a downward trajectory for a year everything i have in here is considered a luxury and when people have to pick and chose where their last dollar goes it is not going to be here

8129900 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8129901 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree said doug pennington spokesman for the brady campaign to prevent gun violence
8129902 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count mr thweatt said

8129909 as our primary demographic is exclusively white and has already overwhelmingly embraced mccain we plan to offer coverage of the republican convention while viewers can get coverage from any number of networks we plan to cover the convention from a uniquely caucasian perspective we are not required to meet the fcc equal time standards that apply to broadcast channels
8129910 life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
8129911 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8129912 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8129913 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8129914 we conducted this study in italy where we picked up 44 infants and divided them into two groups to carry out two sets of experiments we exposed them to about 22 minutes of recordings of the above mentioned words
8129915 while they were exposed to the recordings we monitored the oxygen levels in blood in their brain areas we found that when the babies heard the words papa daddy and mommy the blood oxygen level in certain brain areas went up it showed those brain areas became active on hearing these words papa mommy and thus needed more oxygen
8129916 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8129917 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example

8129928 what were going to be lacking is experience so its going to take a little bit of time for these younger guys to get their feet under them in competition and getting used to playing college golf
8129929 were going to hopefully play well in the fall and start later in the spring so well at least have a chance to play and practice a little bit before that first event
8129930 with dustin pimm deciding to turn professional early we lost our no 1 player and our other guys played pretty good but it wasnt quite as good as we needed it to be
8129931 we just couldnt get into a rhythm in the spring
8129932 there is simply little reason for people to tune in people are not going to pay a lot attention
8129933 not only in our own country but in places like latin america there has been an increasing tendency to be skeptical about parties and party politicians
8129934 there has been an increasing growing distrust in the whole party system though people claim they are supportive of democratic process there is a tendency to say that democracy is great but our democracy in our country is not good
8129935 today i am going to talk to you about liars schemers total rogues and politicians oh im sorry im simply repeating myself arent i
8129936 there have been a lot of politicians that have not been honest in what they have claimed
8129937 the purpose of this undertaking is to create a global educational experience that brings together a few of the finest students from two major universities to cover the american political conventions this summer as working journalists
8129938 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8129939 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8129940 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nunclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8129941 it continues to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons and retains the option to test nuclear weapons again in the future under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
8129942 abby is a talented athlete and setter with high mobility and great hands

8129944 ive had to get used to running a different system
8129945 she did an amazing job handling that pressure and improving throughout the year
8129946 connecting with hitters is not easy and they have been handling it well
8129947 we know we are competing but the competition makes everyone better
8129948 each day we just go out there and try and win
8129949 i didnt have anyone to help me last year and it was really hard to get adjusted
8129950 whoever is running the offense the best and is getting the hitters the sets is the one who will get the job
8129951 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8129952 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8129953 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8129954 fark eh got ammered man ackn ell off you go

8129956 one of the nights theyre shipping the u students down to target and we get to shop all night
8129957 i think what welcome week will do is help prepare them maybe have them feel a little more confident about being a new student
8129958 we kind of had to figure things out on our own it was kind of crazy
8129959 knowing that there are others that will be here to help and give direction its a good feeling for a mom
8129960 i think the kinship was more a result of the entire kennedy legacy
8129961 we need it big time i thought obama had the best chance of winning its a historic convention
8129962 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

8129984 we conducted this study in italy where we picked up 44 infants and divided them into two groups to carry out two sets of experiments we exposed them to about 22 minutes of recordings of the above mentioned words
8129985 while they were exposed to the recordings we monitored the oxygen levels in blood in their brain areas we found that when the babies heard the words papa daddy and mommy the blood oxygen level in certain brain areas went up it showed those brain areas became active on hearing these words papa mommy and thus needed more oxygen

8129998 i think the people of assam cannot ask for anything more as all these world class institutes could go a long way in developing the state in terms of human resource development
8129999 the package is really noteworthy as the prime minister instead of just doling out cash incentives decided to go for specified projects and that too with a vision aimed at developing the skills of local youths by way of setting up several top notch educational facilities
