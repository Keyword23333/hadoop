6230006 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6230007 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6230008 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6230009 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat
6230010 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
6230011 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
6230012 their overall story about the increasing graphics intensity running on our desktops i think thats absolutely true
6230013 the vision they have there in terms of how they think that will all converge is credible to me
6230014 very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
6230015 in established markets like europe and the united states where we have established ways of using computers im not convinced something like the mid device will really take off
6230016 we heard a big crash big big crash so we stopped and we saw a lot of smoke there is a lot of confusion people are trying to call their families
6230017 the whole field went up in flames the emergency services couldnt get to the plane because of the fire going on engulfing the whole fuselage
6230018 the plane was going to return and i just dont know the plane was supposed to have arrived by now
6230019 i was trying to phone them and they just didnt answer they looked on the passenger list and they just couldnt find them we just dont know
6230020 i would just like to say that we are extremely sorry and our thoughts are with the families and we will do everything we can to support them through this very very difficult period
6230021 i think there was a lot of quick worries that things would get worse theres been helicopters continually heading to the scene dropping water over the area
6230022 of course madrid is quite well known for getting forest fires so they responded very quickly to this
6230023 and were seeing lots of ambulances leaving the area theres been about 50 in the last hour or so which have passed me by on the way out of the airport
6230024 south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6230025 our general plan the template that we have in place remains somewhat constant
6230026 if youre jumping around all the time you have 30 new ideas every year then obviously your philosophy is one of change and thats the only way it can be defined
6230027 there is some continuity in how we do things but we have conducted a little bit different camp each particular year to accommodate what that particular team needed to get ready for the season
6230028 for example this year because we have no field goal kickers who have ever kicked in a game weve done live field goals every day in past years perhaps we didnt do field goals every day or if we did them for instance connor hughes going into his fourth year he kicked a lot of them in games so we didnt do those field goals live every field goal that weve kicked this year has been under full game pressure weve kicked every day in training camp
6230029 as i recall we made every kick with all of the kickers participating as i had said way back in the beginning it wasnt very positive in the spring because we didnt make very many now between the three kickers were making quite a few so it continues to be more hopeful
6230030 i think were pretty sure who our return me are going to be
6230031 weve got a number of our coverage positions nailed down we still have some that are in question were working towards finality in a number of those spots
6230032 even the player whos never been injured and doesnt miss a practice or a game eventually is missing from the team through natural attrition
6230033 i think its to everybodys benefit staff and players to understand that everybody we have is here for a very limited period of time were all conditioned so that sooner or later somebody else has got to move into that position
6230034 were always of the mentality to be developing that replacement before hes needed so that when he comes into that circumstance hes properly prepared
6230035 sorry to disturb you this early but could you lend me a small amount of milk

6230052 substantial amounts of money lawfully acquired and be willing to take the oath of allegiance
6230053 we dont want to create confusion how do you become a president of another country at the sometime you are a citizen of another country its the same thing with security heads they are trusted with the countries security information and we cant risk giving them duo citizenship
6230054 as consumers look to stay connected and entertained regardless of where they are and what device they are using the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv thanks to a new generation of internet connected ce devices
6230055 as intel delivers its first ia soc with leading edge performance and internet compatibility for consumer electronics devices we are providing a powerful and flexible technology foundation upon which the industry can quickly innovate upon this technology foundation will help the high tech industry bring devices to market faster as well as encourage new designs and inspire new services such as connecting the tv to the internet

6230064 there i realized the reputation clinton has abroad and she is what we need
6230065 you cannot be an idealist and be a politician but there needs to be a balance
6230066 weve looked at it as the next step in adding our voice to the democratic process

6230074 we are now in a fight against the great russia
6230075 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6230076 georgian prime minister vladimer lado gurgenidze jewish made a special call to israel tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the haredi communitys most important rabbis and spiritual leaders rabbi aharon leib steinman
6230077 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
6230078 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
6230079 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
6230080 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
6230081 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
6230082 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
6230083 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
6230084 there are a few countries that will say told you so
6230085 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
6230086 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
6230087 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
6230088 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
6230089 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
6230090 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
6230091 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
6230092 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
6230093 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
6230094 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
6230095 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
6230096 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
6230097 this may not be a culmination but only step one
6230098 if you dont stop this kind of behaviour it escalates
6230099 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
6230100 body and screen scratches are inevitable we built a full solid screen cover into our new xylo t3s enclosure thats specifically designed to protect the whole device

6230102 we had a great car at michigan but obviously did not get the result we were looking for
6230103 we dropped positions in the standings and now we have to enter the next few races with a different mindset
6230104 before we were in a position where taking risks wasnt an option
6230105 we had a pretty comfortable margin on the transfer spot and we didnt want to jeopardize that

6230109 both the quality of the business and the quality of the person writing it just leapt off the page
6230110 we dont do deals when were ready to buy but rather when a company is ready to sell
6230111 we talk about too big to fail i think some of these places financial firms are too big to manage
6230112 oh my god i love ross why didnt you tell me
6230113 james brings a wealth of experience from a range of fields and is well placed to help freesat in the next stages of its development
6230114 can you imagine it was on the last day that officials of the ministry and the board that ought to keep eye an on the pilgrims knew that they have defected
6230115 one of them covered his bed with pillow to look as if he was sleeping while others just escaped in a similar manner
6230116 the christian pilgrim welfare board takes responsibility for the welfare of pilgrims during pilgrimages
6230117 three hundred and twenty two members performed the last exercise and it was true that four of them defected over there
6230118 well i cannot confirm nor deny the involvement of officials of my ministry in the matter but i want to say that we have put measures in place to curtail such incidence this time around
6230119 toda a gente sabe quem s o a pol cia sabe quem s o mas n o se faz nada
6230120 neste momento n s n o podemos proibir a entrada a ningu m e na maioria das vezes s o clientes que est o identificados fazem mau ambiente e estragam nos os neg cios
6230121 seria o suficiente existir um registo das queixas na pol cia e se determinada pessoa j tivesse uma queixa por desacatos em estabelecimentos nocturnos ficaria impedido de entrar
6230122 se na inglaterra h pessoas proibidas de entrar nos est dios porque n o fazer isto aqui
6230123 eu acho que teriam de ser referenciados com fotografias ou com alguma identifica o porque podem provocar desacatos noutros estabelecimentos e n s n o sabermos
6230124 s vezes chamamos as autoridades para resolver os problemas e h desacatos entre eles e a pr pria pol cia e n o chegam a ser detidos
6230125 em faro esse tipo de problemas acontece muito mas sobretudo no inverno porque no ver o como vivemos sobretudo de pessoal universit rio 70 por cento dos bares est o fechados

6230129 champion motocross rider james stewart comes to southwick with the republican masslive com
6230130 i apologize with great remorse for the actions that i took after the michigan race last saturday afternoon
6230131 my apology is extended to nascar the nascar officials joe and j d gibbs our drivers all of jgrs sponsors and especially to all of the jgr family members that i have misrepresented
6230132 joe and j d gibbs trust me to lead this race team with honesty and integrity i have failed them and feel great remorse for doing so i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses
6230133 first and foremost i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing
6230134 because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation
6230135 i hate it for joe gibbs and j d gibbs that they were put in that situation by their team
6230136 we take everything pretty serious when were trying to do a postrace inspection and evaluate things that have implications long term we really feel like we need to get everybody to give us a fair shot at that
6230137 youve seen our penalties escalate through the last year or more with taking more than one person out in this particular case crew chiefs and car chiefs were suspended and we feel because of the situation relative to engines we felt like the engine tuner probably had something to do with it
6230138 and also the seventh man suspended was a mechanic identified as someone who did it
6230139 it just gives us a flexibility on the time how long it needs to be
6230140 when we do these tests whether it be dyno tests there was a time when we went to the wind tunnel quite a bit and other things that we do to evaluate the competition in the garage area we take that very very serious
6230141 i cant tell you how serious we take it its serious because were trying to give everybody a fair chance
6230142 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6230143 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6230144 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6230145 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive
6230146 i know i am a loser but posting pictures of
6230147 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security
6230148 what happens when you come back is that theres not a level of trustworthiness that youve had there among the people because you did this once before
6230149 when we leave they will either go back to being farmers or will be killed
6230150 as long as someone is there someone who represents the government or represents security to the people i think well be ok the question is who and to what degree
6230151 we are undermanned in order to be able to do all we need to do in the south
6230152 je cherche protection aupr s du seigneur de laube naissante
6230153 its coming down on everybody team members crew chiefs drivers lot of pressure we just have to go out and run the hardest we can and drive the wheels off of it and make good calls well study hard focus hard and well make things happen
6230154 dovers always been a good track for me and i love racing there
6230155 its a big bristol and as a race car driver you can make the difference in the race car if the cars not perfect then you can make it up a bit while its still a team effort its a lot of fun to be able to curl up on the wheel and make things happen every now and then

6230168 i know i am a loser but posting pictures of
6230169 this decision follows several weeks of discussions with fa chairman lord triesman on the role of the chief executive within the new fa structure
6230170 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the interests of all parties
6230171 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy
6230172 the organisation is in better financial health than ever before
6230173 on the pitch i am convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success
6230174 i would like to express my sincere thanks to brian for the stability and growth that he has brought to the organisation
6230175 brian leaves with our best wishes for the future and will always be welcome back as our guest at wembley

6230184 desde hace 10 a os vargas fue nombrado como estado lo cual s lo ha simbolizado una formalidad ya que sus cr ticas condiciones no responden a este nombramiento
6230185 los recursos del puerto de la guaira y del aeropuerto sim n bol var son fuentes important simas para la construcci n del estado al igual que la descentralizaci n de la salud y de la educaci n
6230186 un estado vargas descentralizado es sin nimo de un vargas de primera es por ello que uno de los primeros pasos para alcanzarlo ser la solicitud ante la asamblea nacional para la declaraci n de zona libre en el estado con el fin de expandir la econom a y atraer inversiones significativas as como ocurri en margarita y en paraguan
6230187 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 percent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events
6230188 these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6230189 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well capital positions are well above the minimum levels required by regulation
6230190 its also possible he was walking in and around the central city area and the viaduct basin during that period

6230194 preserving marriage as the indispensable institution in which children are conceived born and raised to adulthood by a loving father and mother is vital to a healthy society
6230195 is both an indication of how important we believe this referendum to be and an encouragement to other groups and individuals of all faiths to lend their support as well
6230196 from the day the organization was founded 126 years ago strengthening and protecting the family has always been central to the mission of the knights of columbus preserving marriage as the indispensable institution in which children are conceived born and raised to adulthood by a loving father and mother is vital to a healthy society it is also the most favorable environment in which to protect the rights and best interests of children we are proud to join the catholic bishops and priests of california and so many other people of good will in this effort on which so much depends
6230197 this generous donation from the knights of columbus shows the broad based support that protect marriage is receiving from a variety of faith based organizations proposition 8 is honored to have the support of an esteemed organization who has such a strong record of public service and success

6230203 clearly i think the taxpayers would rather spend their money on police and fire and streets than they would on the arts
6230204 i dont have the words to express how i felt when i saw that
6230205 the bottom line is that we cant operate without support
6230206 it will have a negative effect a very negative effect on this community
6230207 everything you see in this building doesnt belong to the city it belongs to tpac which is a private non profit entity
6230208 everything in this building would go if tpac the entity went
6230209 until im told by the board of directors i need to have an auction to sell the things in this building thats when ill be concerned
6230210 what do you have there is that the main course
6230211 it was just one of those rash comments i made
6230212 its totally worth it if i can get more kids to read its really worth it
6230213 out of my opinion i thought it was very disgusting
6230214 i didnt read as much as my sister i read about 96 books
6230215 id do almost anything to get people to read so this is about as far as ive ever gone before
6230216 it was much needed in this area that everything is closing down and the families of this area dont have anywhere to take their children
6230217 its been a long process we purchased it back in april and weve hired a lot of contractors and youth from our church to help paint and remodel
6230218 over here is our doll house dramatic play area where the children can experience everyday life

6230224 the chapter on closure which i would sum up with these two points 1 the peer pressure created by closed networks builds commitment and productivity 2 the peer pressure created by closed networks reinforces groupthink and promotes mindless stereotypes

6230238 hal ini sekali lagi membuktikan kemunafikan pemerintah as yang mempraktikkan demokrasi di dalam negeri tetapi sangat otoriter dalam kebijakan luar negerinya
6230239 al manar ini adalah media perjuangan melawan penindasan israel dan hizbullah yang dikategorikan sebagai teroris oleh pemerintah as adalah para pejuang kemerdekaan sama dengan para pejuang kita dahulu yang dikategorikan ekstremis oleh penjajah belanda
6230240 saya juga mohon as tidak bias menilai bahwa islam sama dengan teroris

6230242 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6230243 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6230244 if that duplication of the gene may be five per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6230245 there was another severe poisoning that might have been fatal but mom also was very groggy so she stopped breastfeeding
6230246 so probably the baby was saved by not being breastfed
6230247 babies are much more sensitive to morphine than we thought in the past
6230248 we believe that should be a red flag from now on
6230249 so theres a lot of reason to rethink how we practise we need people to rethink it and especially if some babies may die from it thats totally unacceptable
6230250 it shouldnt provoke alarm among individual patients but it should provoke concern among professionals
6230251 the fundraising review of hundreds of thousands of donations involving ap bureaus around the globe found clear evidence that both campaigns took money first and asked questions later if ever

6230256 im happy to see they are having prayer at their sessions and they have a right to choose whom they want to do that
6230257 hopefully they will know being catholic is more foundational to their identity than anything else
6230258 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
6230259 to convince people they should not be embarrassed at being catholic and not buy the supposedly american notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
6230260 i am tired of people telling religious folks to be quiet in the public square because of constitutional questions of separation of church and state

6230378 to get at the way we use the bible is one of the ways we can get at the larger issues facing the communion
6230379 the issue of homosexuality comes down to an issue about the bible
6230380 underneath all the discussions and debates is how do we view the bible
6230381 one of the legacies of anglicanism is that it has a long history of being interested in the detail of scripture that detail can be approached quite differently
6230382 inhospitality expressed through male rape it may have nothing at all to do with homosexuality
6230383 i dont believe that its widely different i think its claimed that its widely different
6230384 the same things are happening everyone in the anglican communion has their own process of making sense of the bible people who claim that their way of making sense is taking the bible more seriously than someone else are just trying to talk more loudly or stamp their foot more firmly
6230385 i dont think that the anglican communion will be departing from that position were going back to first principles about the way we use the bible
6230386 a common commitment to bring our contexts into engagement with scripture
6230387 will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
6230388 very difficult times in his life both financially and emotionally

6230392 said she was going through some difficult problems and was dealing with a very ill mother what she found in this bible was greatly helpful and just what she needed
6230393 what other lives did my old living bible touch along its journey from illinois to georgia to maryland and hopefully back to florida someday
6230394 it is the least i can do for all his blessings to me

6230403 ive loved working with msnbc and being asked to host my own show is an amazing opportunity

6230422 the church is in a stronger position having someone like him leading rather than walking away

6230471 the taliban caught us by surprise in an ambush that was extremely well prepared our men were not in a position to respond and fell in the first minutes

6230473 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6230474 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6230475 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6230476 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6230477 can only be positive for map but it doesnt wipe out the questions from before or the concerns of some allies none of that has gone away
6230478 this position will have gone down very well in tbilisi but do we really mean to commit ourselves to all out war against the russian federation if something like this happens again
6230479 if western hawks really are advocating nato membership for every small country that borders the russian federation even a government more charitably disposed towards nato than the present russian one is going to see the move as a direct challenge
6230480 they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make decisions on the basis of their own popular will

6230486 we were from arauza de miel arauza of honey nearby it is a sweet name but this is a bitter story
6230487 when they said they had found my fathers body it was the best thing that happened to me
6230488 of course it makes me angry to think of these injustices growing up without a father or a grandfather was terrible but i never thought i would get this happiness and sadness at the same time
6230489 i wanted my sons to see this it may be a little morbid but it is real life and i want them to tell their friends about this
6230490 i think we should be talking about this now not forgetting what happens here today may only be a drop of water in the ocean but it is important i always said that this happened because of ignorance and fanaticism between families and neighbours
6230491 my father said there is not a day that goes past that he doesnt think about this thats why he was determined that i should come and do this
6230492 you will notice that they are not afraid to talk a lot they are sad but also glad for them it is closure a kind of relief
6230493 he is the first judge to ask for the official archives to be opened we believe this could produce information which proves that these killings were systematic if that can be shown to be the case perhaps we could see a commission set up to find the real truth or even call those who carried out these crimes to answer
6230494 it is difficult to say though as no national research has been done just on a province by province basis and records have been destroyed
6230495 there were at least 101 000 people whose names we know perhaps more but of those lying in mass graves i would estimate that there are at least as many as 30 000 across spain
6230496 i dont think people have the slightest idea it is big news to them franco still has an amazingly good press in the anglo saxon world
6230497 like most others my grandfather alejo ovejero was shot by francos people i want to find him and others like him

6230502 we will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions chairman mao made and unswervingly follow whatever instructions chairman mao gave

6230505 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones were no more than a show
6230506 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6230507 the idea of demonstration is that you are hoping to resolve issues not to demonstrate for the sake of demonstrating we are pleased that issues have been resolved through dialogue and communication this is how we do it in chinese culture
6230508 we want everyone to express their opinion everyone has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6230509 the olympics are about sport we are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the olympics is a catalyst for development here that catalytic effect is happening but the olympics are not a panacea for all ills
6230510 but things are different now for our people these are good happy days

6230515 the ministry is ensuring the safety of muslims by hiring more staff for night shifts imams and workers will be present every day
6230516 i dont wish to confront islam itself i only want to spread the message that muslims should be allowed to leave islam behind without being threatened
6230517 the past years i have visited many interesting countries from tunisia to turkey and from cyprus to iran but nowhere i have that special feeling of solidarity that i always get if i set foot on the israeli ben gurion airport

6230525 you dont need me on earth you need me but in heaven you dont need that connection because all you are is happy
6230526 but youre a part of me and wouldnt you be a part of me in heaven i mean maybe were like a swirl cone two parts that make a whole and we can go to heaven together
6230527 on earth were two halves but in heaven were both whole
6230528 so in heaven you can do whatever you want to worship god
6230529 like i could be ella fitzgerald in heaven i could just sing all the time
6230530 angels fall on their knees in heaven because theyre so everjoyed
6230531 but falling on your knees doesnt make you an angel
6230532 yeah theyve got all wings covered in skin and eyes covering their wings thats why they always tell people they appear to not to be afraid

6230539 the respected shaykh haji farooq rahmatullahi alayh used to say that
6230540 yeah they said shes already really far into labor so i better get back in there
6230541 harry the reason this baby is so close to coming out so soon is because there is something else pushing it harry were having twins
6230542 you fainted when i told you that instead of popping out one kid there were two coming out
6230543 there getting cleaned we had a boy and a girl
6230544 we never agreed on thise names i was thinking more like chase and abigail
6230545 its ok the bobby pin just fell out im putting a new one in you look amazing paige
6230546 doug stop fijiting i cant tie your bow tie when you keep bouncing up and down
6230547 im so nervous what if she decides to leave me at the alter what if all we do is fight what if she find out im really ugly and immature
6230548 i now pronounce you husband and wife you may now kiss the bride
6230549 if you know where you are this map can tell you where to tune
6230550 this is exceptional circumstances and it really was a decision taken only because there were no other placement options available at the time
6230551 while we think this is very very undesirable and exceptionally rare it was the only option available to our caseworkers at the time
6230552 it appears that two rooms have been cultivated and removed and theres one actual room that still hasnt be cultivated
6230553 it appears that the fire brigade may have arrived and scared them and theyve gone
6230554 ill just have another look and finetune the whole thing
6230555 i have been thinking about it over the last few months since this process started but i will just finetune it now and make my intentions known probably in the next few weeks
6230556 ill be sitting down with my family and looking at the options
6230557 what i need is to protect and ensure that all of my existing members of parliament who havent announced their retirement to date actually continue on
6230558 there are any number of communities throughout queensland who are crying out for candidates of the capability of stuart copeland
6230559 a couple of the towns that have been split in two have now been put into the various electorates as a whole body
6230560 i dont think its beneficial to any town to be cut in two theres always a quip going around that oh youve got two members or three members going to represent you but it doesnt work like that
6230561 so i think they should be really pleased and i think overall its a good outcome for the nanango electorate
6230562 i will be endeavouring to put out a flyer to let people know how the boundaries have actually changed for them and that they will be in the nanango electorate in the future
6230563 that will happen between now and christmas i will try to get to everybody
6230564 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function properly on the 3g network
6230565 considering that a true fix has yet to be issued for users 3g problems this could just be the tip of the iphone lawsuit iceberg
6230566 everyone is saying its unfair i got ripped everyone is saying i got ripped
6230567 i could crawl up and cry like a baby but i am trying to be strong i guess this wasnt meant to be i guess god has other ideas for me
6230568 the reason for no points was they didnt see it
6230569 all i can do is laugh or cry about it i prefer to laugh
6230570 the judges were not fair not just to me but to africa
6230571 if the judges were fair the score would have been like 4 5
6230572 for me it felt that i might have scored some more points
6230573 i will not hesitate to impose whatever is necessary should you disgrace taekwondo or the wtf in any way
6230574 the referees and judges involved in inappropriate action or in making grave mistakes will not be tolerated and will no longer be allowed to officiate at wtf promoted events including this olympic taekwondo competition
6230575 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6230576 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6230577 england is my home its where my heart is and family are i cant wait to see them god bless them all
6230578 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there its been a nightmare every second i was set up thats all i will say
6230579 im not going back to london you cant make me ive done my time im a free man
6230580 obsessively create fiercely independent characters who seek to destroy all the patriarchal structures
6230581 echo chamber that promises hope but only delivers deceit by offering claims of something that will not come
6230582 there was an absolute shift in thinking about the border from drug interdiction alien interdiction criminal interdiction at our borders to one of national security
6230583 there is literally no protection there are some border patrol agents but at night i could assure you i could go into mexico and return to the united states carrying a suitcase nuke
6230584 and if we cannot control our borders if we cannot control who comes here were never going to have national security
6230585 we need a steady funding stream as we move into the next few years to make sure were able to sustain the investments weve made in technology and infrastructure along our borders
6230586 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness and if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle that is
6230587 i will ask the all party parliamentary heritage committee to organise a visit for mps to bletchley and i hope both the commons and lords will support the independents campaign
6230588 at a time when the russians were in alliance with hitler and the americans were not at war it was there in a few acres that vital work was done that allowed britain to maintain the atlantic lifeline and take the fight to the axis powers in the mediterranean and north africa
6230589 there are no statues to code breakers in trafalgar square but bletchley helped win the war i hope the government business and those who remember britains lonely stand for freedom from 1939 until other great powers joined as allies is recalled by making bletchley a memorial visitors site for the 21st century
6230590 the department is aware of the campaign and while we recognise the excellent work carried out at bletchley park as well as its historical significance it has no plans to extend the departments sponsorship of museums and galleries beyond the present number
6230591 competition for hlf grants is tough but if an application is submitted it will be assessed under hlfs usual criteria including the funds requirements that projects must conserve and enhance the uks diverse heritage
6230592 it would be daft to allow bletchley park to disappear like saying the cabinet war rooms should be sealed up
6230593 the whole world knows the massive contribution bletchley park made not only to winning the war but to substantially shortening its duration it would be a national disgrace for this historic location not to be saved for posterity i warmly welcome the independents initiative
6230594 my mother was a linguist and my father worked on the building of colossus which was the worlds first programmable computer
6230595 the contribution that all the people there made in finishing the war is still underestimated and the park itself is a priceless part of our heritage the state in which it has been allowed to fall is a disgrace
6230596 i congratulate the independent for taking this up i would support any action that saw the trust raise its profile in appealing on behalf of the park
6230597 a lot of people were given them in the 16th century but there were none left as they were all melted down except for the one worn by the lord mayor of london whose provenance goes back to 1520 but its only 10 to 20 per cent original and the rest of it has been added or repaired
6230598 this one has had metallurgic tests and is 100 per cent original
6230599 its provenance had been traced to the 1700s but in tests it was found that it is gold alloy which was only used between 1546 and 1552
6230600 the idea of handing these chains down was thought to have been started by john of gaunt during the reign of richard ii i have traced it back to the wife of edward iii who was the daughter of the king of france who had a brooch with the letters on it and she gave it to her son john of gaunt who used it as livery
6230601 we didnt attempt to compare the quality of the ingredients but when it comes to the contents of the cheapest food the discount stores did just as well as and sometimes better than tesco
6230602 difficult times call for extreme measures and its clear that some people wont be splashing out on luxuries in the near future people still want quality but its all about value for money
6230603 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6230604 thats why i will set out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6230605 i bought an electric moped which i think is the technology of the future i got rid of the leaders car shortly after i got in
6230606 something very big is going on particularly in urban britain
6230607 out of the 30 british cities we now lead 12 that has been going on for years that is where the great battlegrounds will be between ourselves and labour at the next general election there are a lot of seats up for grabs in those areas
6230608 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6230609 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag
6230610 one of the most effective strategies we have developed during the course of the past two or three years in terms of obtaining a speedy and satisfactory resolution for us plaintiffs has been the threat or implementation of multi jurisdictional proceedings
6230611 for a european however the notion that there should be no safety net in place whereby the veracity of what is published as fact in the public forum can be monitored is very difficult to contemplate
6230612 served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work
6230613 in the past anyone who could be classified as a public figure in the us has simply had to ignore these false and outrageous allegations being thrown at them in the tabloids
6230614 with the ever increasing expansion of internet publication and with us magazines such as the national enquirer now distributing uk irish editions i am being consulted more and more by internationally famous stars who would otherwise have difficulty in seeking vindication of their reputations in the us where the libel laws are geared much more in favour of the press

6230632 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6230633 it is a great victory for afghanistan said mohammad sukran an 18 year old student
6230634 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting this is finally good news for afghanistan
6230635 most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction
6230636 adding about 3 of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn which has never been made possible with gasoline alone
6230637 we have improved fuel efficiency by 30 and reduced co2 emissions by 30 in recent tests
6230638 retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels a uk company called itm recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars so a solution is forming
6230639 the key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology so far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well to wheel co2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car as a result it was a bit of an expensive non starter
6230640 organic hydrides are a high efficiency high density storage media for hydrogen
6230641 the end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like todays conventional fuels
6230642 conspiracy theories aside the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30 boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it
6230643 modifying an existing technology unless it is mandated by some government agency will not likely go anywhere
6230644 we were hoping to have the beamline in operation by now
6230645 this is likely to be a problem when you are building equipment that is the first of its kind in the world and pushing the frontiers of technology some of the companies and groups we have been working with have been wonderful and helped us find innovative solutions
6230646 its also a collaboration between the clinical community and scientists working in the physical and biological sciences and engineers we have particularly strong links with clinicians in the neuro oncology group in cambridge and the gray cancer institute
6230647 because i am a woman i must make unusual efforts to
6230648 all women are encouraged to join us at these rallies with their peaceful femininity and unshakable determination
6230649 a change in the law and in mentalities will prove to be a healthy change for the american population as a whole
6230650 americans are far too uptight about matters of the body so yes women should have the same rights as men in theory hell yes i would do it in practice legality wouldnt stop my fellow americans from being uptight and judgmental so id likely hold back in most circumstances which is how ive slightly resentfully approached public breast feeding
6230651 that is one of the reasons the officers showed no urgency nothing the officers did or said caused this dog to die
6230652 its just a dog you can buy another one relax
6230653 i dont feel a person like that should be working in law enforcement
6230654 a bortion foes are now accusing sen barack obama of being an abortion rights extremist
6230655 a bortion foes are now accusing sen barack obama of being an abortion rights extremist
6230656 at issue is a measure in both illinois and congress called the born alive infants protection act which defines as a protected human any life expelled from a mother abortion foes championed the cause when an illinois nurse and antiabortion activist said some pre viable fetuses were being aborted by inducing labor and then being allowed to die
6230657 obama then a state senator opposed the measure in 2001 saying it crossed the line of constitutionality and essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6230658 but weisman did not note that in addition to saying that the bill was constitutionally problematic obama has also said it wasnt necessary he has
6230659 existing illinois law already requires doctors to provide medical care in the very rare case that babies are born alive during abortions
6230660 some pre viable fetuses were being aborted by inducing labor and then being allowed to die
6230661 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6230662 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6230663 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6230664 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6230665 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6230666 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6230667 theyre amazing people we became so close with them they taught us so much about their country their culture their clothing
6230668 one of my favorite musical dance numbers in this is called dance me if you can
6230669 and we were filming that at the monsoon palace which is on top of this huge hill that we had to drive up and by the time we got out of hair and makeup the sun was rising you could see all of udaipur and it was so amazing that was like every moment that week i just was like im in india i am in india it was so awesome and just the whole place everywhere we shot was just incredibly gorgeous
6230670 we know that the fans are really going to love this music we cant wait to see them do some of the dancing that we do in the movie
6230671 the tour is super fun you have to understand you wake up at like three oclock in the afternoon how can you beat that
6230672 i suspect it masks a small fall in like for like sales but the profit figure is reasonable and this shows they are watching costs very carefully
6230673 our three year investment programme is well under way and we are delighted by the performance of our new stores which were opened earlier this year in both belfast and high wycombe
6230674 she said mom im ok im home but i think somebody might have been in my house
6230675 she called again a few hours later with panic in her voice
6230676 they found a body in merediths room i gotta go the police want to talk to me
6230677 currently a seller could pay as much as 1 30 to list a single fixed price item for a maximum of 10 days that will now come down to a flat rate of 40p regardless of the price of the item and will be on the site for up to 30 days up from 10
6230678 the main focus is to grow the site to appeal to retailers at the moment it is used by very few retailers and ebay sees potential in growing itself as a platform for anyone to buy anything
6230679 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6230680 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and integrity without them these beautiful structures would be unable to withstand their surroundings and would collapse into stars
6230681 this creates an attractive entry point to an abundance of near term exploration and appraisal drilling also further exploration success could make tullow an m amp a merger amp acquisition target next year
6230682 fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment we maintain our year end wti west texas intermediate price forecast of 149 per barrel
6230683 this years dividend looks secure but what about next bts cash flows continue to come under pressure from lower margins and higher capex capital expenditure
6230684 the bank of england monetary policy committee meeting minutes had sparked hopes of a cut in interest rates
6230685 but the oil price has balanced that and there is a worry that inflation may kill any chances of a cut
6230686 we believe the leading uk operators premier inn which is owned by whitbread and travelodge privately owned are best positioned to consolidate the highly fragmented independent budget hotel market and increase market shares without risking overcapacity
6230687 people are talking about an improved bid after steve ingham michael pages chief executive said that a sale was possible at 600p a share they probably wont get that high a price but it shows the possibility of a sale
6230688 a bone in the throat of the american and french crusaders
6230689 a lot of people were given them in the 16th century but there were none left as they were all melted down except for the one worn by the lord mayor of london whose provenance goes back to 1520 but its only 10 to 20 per cent original and the rest of it has been added or repaired
6230690 this one has had metallurgic tests and is 100 per cent original
6230691 its provenance had been traced to the 1700s but in tests it was found that it is gold alloy which was only used between 1546 and 1552
6230692 the idea of handing these chains down was thought to have been started by john of gaunt during the reign of richard ii i have traced it back to the wife of edward iii who was the daughter of the king of france who had a brooch with the letters on it and she gave it to her son john of gaunt who used it as livery
6230693 this is not an ordinary or everyday demonstration the indians have told us they are not afraid if the government declares a state of emergency they prefer to die there and show that this government violates human rights
6230694 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the oil pipeline and gas through the camisea gas pipeline
6230695 brian has taken a lot of stick about him being the sole person to appoint mcclaren
6230696 this responsibility has to be shared among us all its unfair to say he was brians man he was the fas man
6230697 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6230698 he conducted an adulterous affair before leaving his disabled wife enjoys eight residences across the country as well as corporate jets
6230699 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
6230700 the prices of gas are up the prices of milk are up
6230701 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
6230702 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6230703 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6230704 support george bush 95 per cent of the time keep spending 10bn 5 4bn a month for the war in iraq
6230705 devil may care is a period book which is set in the 1960s and it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been making recently
6230706 i would have thought that if you could move casino royale from the 1950s you could move devil may care from the sixties but eon know what they are doing
6230707 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6230708 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness and if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle that is
6230709 we made a 12m offer for santa cruz last week and we were told to forget it in the bluntest possible terms
6230710 weve been told to give up on him mark is adamant that we dont but its fair to say the window is closing and that blackburn have closed it on us
6230711 i think thats so given that we have already taken their manager off them
6230712 i have said jokingly to mark you have only yourself to blame but this is a part of what marks all about he wants the best and he wants to bring in players he already knows he doesnt really like taking on the unknown unfortunately he cant this time and will have to bring in someone new and develop them
6230713 if youre 31 and fancy a bit of champions league its difficult for us to compete with that
6230714 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6230715 it really demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife
6230716 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken 100 years to get from the balustrade to the house were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6230717 discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6230718 we had the chance of replying to the offers of other clubs like manchester city but he as well as me said no it is a chance for him to get his life back in order as far as his career and as far as the france team is concerned
6230719 people were perhaps expecting djibril to move to a prestigious team and sunderland without being among the great english clubs are part of a league where clubs have all the economic power and sporting importance with sunderland it isnt an impulsive thing but as he came to the end of this transfer window he wanted to leave and showed a massive desire to play it is that more than his divorce from om that is in his mind at the moment
6230720 we have made some good progress over the last few days and if we can get them over the finishing line then thats the end of my business this summer
6230721 i have spoken to one or two players over the last few days
6230722 all you can do is the best you can im very relaxed about it we have made some great offers with some good deals and we feel it would be a good move for the players involved i have to trust the players to make the right decision
6230723 the uncertainty of the situation does not make it possible for the club to seek out a replacement for andrei before the september 1 transfer deadline and zenit consider the question of the transfer of the player to tottenham closed
6230724 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be
6230725 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6230726 there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6230727 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6230728 thats why i will set out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6230729 i bought an electric moped which i think is the technology of the future i got rid of the leaders car shortly after i got in
6230730 something very big is going on particularly in urban britain
6230731 out of the 30 british cities we now lead 12 that has been going on for years that is where the great battlegrounds will be between ourselves and labour at the next general election there are a lot of seats up for grabs in those areas
6230732 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6230733 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag
6230734 so many times ive imagined killing him and then killing myself
6230735 a young innocent boy who turned into a monster and a country so full of promise transformed into a concentration camp
6230736 without ever boasting that he was the son of the great leader
6230737 to this day i know nothing of the details of their deaths of whether they blamed me as they perished
6230738 they were sent away to different uninhabited islands in an attempt to end their substandard genes from repeating in a new generation left for dead none of the people made it back home
6230739 if you want to see short people who are suffering from malnutrition you have to go outside the capital ive no reason to doubt this allegation
6230740 today just as he hoped kim vision has been realised
6230741 he has managed to extract resources from wealthier and stronger states by manufacturing crises and generating international instability his brand of nuclear blackmail is a virtual guarantor of bottomless international aid for the worlds most militarised society
6230742 those who have known kim jong il since youth are bound to see him as human not the centre of a god like cult of personality
6230743 i who became a university professor thanks to his father i who travelled to russia seoul and now washington i no longer loathe him i pity him even though he killed my family i have already forgiven him
6230744 we didnt attempt to compare the quality of the ingredients but when it comes to the contents of the cheapest food the discount stores did just as well as and sometimes better than tesco
6230745 difficult times call for extreme measures and its clear that some people wont be splashing out on luxuries in the near future people still want quality but its all about value for money
6230746 the slapdash release is being done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever
6230747 it is in breach of their terms as laid out by them in an agreement made with my ex manager being warner
6230748 the sleeve art is predictably appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it
6230749 i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me
6230750 she is particularly interested in the great sphinx of giza
6230751 she claims she feels a great spiritual connection to it i took her to visit and she started talking to it
6230752 i represented his tour ages ago i could not think of anything worse now
6230753 when i worked with her there was another journalist called heather mills who worked for the observer and for a time my heather pretended to be her
6230754 i always say she is the most interesting person ive worked with
6230755 if its biting russell group universities then it shows really how serious we should be taking the shortage of students in science and maths
6230756 the league tables have rather subtly injected a kind of poison into the education system
6230757 in one subject at gcse we believe we have had a rogue assessment which means our results would be considerably less good than they will be in three or four weeks time when they have been re marked
6230758 in general i think they are highly suspect and not comparing like with like the league table era is on its way out
6230759 after 11 years of a labour government most young people are still failing to achieve five good gcses including maths and english if we are going to have a world class education system we must do more to promote educational achievement especially among the most disadvantaged children
6230760 there is a grave danger that academic study is being reserved for the high performers which will widen socio economic divides
6230761 if this were to escalate there is a very real possibility of a reversion to a system akin to the grammar secondary modern divide though arguably in less meritocratic a form
6230762 that a purportedly equalising labour government should be the architect of such a divide would be tragic irony significantly though it is all too apparent that it is the system which has lost interest in the pupils largely because they run the risk of not delivering the right a to c performance through academic gcses
6230763 the achievement gap between children from deprived backgrounds and the more affluent is closing just because a pupil is on free school meals does not mean they are destined to fail at school many schools in the most deprived areas are achieving excellent gcse results
6230764 it is ridiculous to suggest that performance tables are designed to meet government targets for example two years ago we deliberately changed the tables to include achievement in english and maths this brought about a big decline in reported performance but we made this change because it best served the needs of pupils parents and employers
6230765 wish i was a little bit taller wish i was a baller
6230766 lessons from the first mazda 6 and mazdas newer successful vehicles especially the mazda cx 7 and the award winning cx 9
6230767 its probably more likely they would go campaign against it once its on the ballot because they could potentially waste some energy challenging it
6230768 so far i dont think this has stirred up any vehement opposition
6230769 there are so many people that wanted to sign the petition and even those that declined to do so werent rallying against it they just didnt feel like they should
6230770 its just going to be a supplement it gives us the opportunity to write tickets quicker
6230771 i anticipate we are going to be writing a few more tickets
6230772 we have cut some lawns and we anticipate we will be doing more of those
6230773 several people have mentioned to me that there has been a change
6230774 appears to contain a lot of relatively unaccomplished people who simply nominated themselves
6230775 hey guys did we really mean to put hampden sydney college over 250 spots above nyu
6230776 we literally generated whole tubes in the lab from scratch
6230777 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
6230778 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
6230779 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
6230780 the so called christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive but in spite of their religion not because of it the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
6230781 the position i have always adopted is that much of animal nature is indeed altruistic cooperative and even attended by benevolent subjective emotions but that this follows from rather than contradicts selfishness at the genetic level
6230782 the world and the universe is an extremely beautiful place and the more we understand about it the more beautiful does it appear
6230783 i think its just a great package and it has a lot to offer the fans
6230784 if you add up all the songs that you know from all three of those bands its pretty incredible that you get that in one show im really excited about it its really crazy it really goes to show the level of songwriting of all three bands
6230785 radiant sea a collection of bootleg rarities and two new songs
6230786 were not too arrogant to do that we also to our satisfaction play a lot of the new songs we try to mix it up and make it fun music is our passion when you get to do it live in front of people it makes it that much better
6230787 we have an incredible fan base there one that has been so very passionate and really solidly interested in everything the band has done in the last 15 years
6230788 its shocking but now that i see what we did im really glad we waited it was such a perfect night put it this way if we had to wait for this im glad we did
6230789 from the beginning we were happy and felt fortunate to make music for a living
6230790 weve always taken pride in trying to make the best music we can make at that time we put our passion and energy into each album theres no conscious thought about how do we maintain anything were just five guys who like to make music and feel blessed to be able to do it
6230791 i think that my lyrics have always been a little bit ahead of my age from what people tell me
6230792 we got beat on a lot when we were in our early 20s for being so serious now that im 36 37 im getting more of a pass people have grown with it and appreciate it a bit more than they did 10 years ago weve aged well and the musics aged well and people are still really into it and still really want to comment and participate in it
6230793 anything you read in print has already had its influence on the stock markets
6230794 if youre building on someone elses platform whenever they are down you are down ther
6230795 what theyre discovering is theres a lot more to recycle and what theyre having is these recycle bins that get full
6230796 were not only cleaning our environment but also were saving the city money
6230797 your friend jane bought this in red you might also like the black
6230798 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6230799 britains wildlife may be the most studied and surveyed in the world but there are still many creatures so far undiscovered out there for us to find
6230800 i put a lot of thought into this because youre my esteemed friends
6230801 frozen food displays appallingly because the freezer section is usually at the back of a store and because you just dont look at boxes covered in frost and go yum yum
6230802 all of those factors are involved but the leading factor is price
6230803 if you think about iceland in particular it has a very strong discount image a lot of their stores were located near to kwiksave shops and when that chain closed last year iceland picked up a lot of business the new perceptions are that frozen food is great value and theres no waste
6230804 the average waitrose shopper wouldnt be seen dead in iceland
6230805 when you go to the marks amp spencer simply food at the station on your way home from work youre likely to buy a chilled ready meal
6230806 jean christophe has spent many days and nights in newcastle at the findus factory
6230807 ensuring every single product meets his high expectations at every stage of the recipe development each dish is freshly prepared on site then fast frozen in a process that takes just 2 hours by comparison domestic freezers can take as long as 12 hours to complete the process and produce much larger ice crystals that affect the quality of the food when thawed and reheated
6230808 hand moulded and carefully placed in the tray the fish is then positioned on top to protect the spinach this is then covered with a sauce that uses fresh double cream and sprinkled with emmental and cheddar cheese fresh of course
6230809 this isnt just frozen spinach this is hand moulded frozen spinach
6230810 firms such as birds eye have done a great deal to remove the view that frozen food is filled with preservatives and to argue for the view that its better to have frozen than nominally fresh food that has taken a long while to get to you
6230811 frozen veg is so handy and healthy too because freezing locks in all the goodness with this youre never stuck for a bit on the side
6230812 weve added about 700 000 extra households into the brand
6230813 people who were buying infrequently are consuming it more and buying on a regular basis people who were potentially rejecting it are now reappraising and trialling
6230814 but i suspect that the issue of the strength of the trend depends on how long we continue with the credit crunch at this stage no one really knows how long that will be
6230815 i liked the idea of having a bicycle wheel in my studio i enjoyed looking at it just as i enjoyed looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace it was like having a fireplace in my studio the movement of the wheel reminded me of the movement of flames
6230816 a girl with brilliant laughing eyes and plump matt cheeks a black polo cap crammed on her head who was pushing a bicycle with with such an uninhibited swing of the hips and using slang terms typical of the gutter and shouting so loudly that i concluded all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the velodromes and must be the very juvenile mistresses of racing cyclists
6230817 you park up your car for four days arent at home to use any of your electrical equipment are living in a tent and using communal facilities
6230818 its harder to collect sort and recycle rubbish in the wet things get dirty its more difficult and some people just cant be bothered
6230819 ive never seen a cleaner festival than latitude but it already has that thoughtful air to it at reading and leeds the audience profile is younger its is not that they dont care but if doing something good means walking to the recycling point and missing the best band of the night they wont do it
6230820 we make sure all our cups at reading and leeds are paper and theres a 10p deposit on them to encourage people to return them
6230821 we have three or four different types of bin and well station a green messenger at every rubbish point literally directing peoples hands to the right bin otherwise it just becomes a pile of rubbish
6230822 there isnt a huge amount of consumer pressure for them either it is mainly driven by ourselves but the plus factor is that other festivals are following the lead
6230823 as much as three quarters of an events carbon footprint is created by people travelling to the festival
6230824 most organisers are doing as much as they can but its the audience who are going to make the difference
6230825 most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction
6230826 adding about 3 of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn which has never been made possible with gasoline alone
6230827 we have improved fuel efficiency by 30 and reduced co2 emissions by 30 in recent tests
6230828 retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels a uk company called itm recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars so a solution is forming
6230829 the key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology so far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well to wheel co2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car as a result it was a bit of an expensive non starter
6230830 organic hydrides are a high efficiency high density storage media for hydrogen
6230831 the end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like todays conventional fuels
6230832 conspiracy theories aside the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30 boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it
6230833 modifying an existing technology unless it is mandated by some government agency will not likely go anywhere
6230834 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6230835 i am not getting back on the plane with all the press there
6230836 and im not going to london you cant make me i have done my time i am a free man
6230837 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6230838 this damaging confusion in the midst of an international crisis with one minister saying one thing and another saying the opposite must be immediately cleared up
6230839 what i disagree with is the dangerous behaviour of david cameron in tbilisi when he said georgia should immediately join nato to punish the russians
6230840 all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
6230841 precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
6230842 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a took place and the failure became inevitable
6230843 it certainly raises eyebrows that the firm promoting this letter is the same outfit that fueled the
6230844 there was a lot of discussion among the different parties so what we plan is to take a look at those and factor them into our decision making
6230845 creative site planning with involvement of the community enabled us to create alternative plans that meet the navy yards program for a grocery store and retail and industrial space while allowing for the restoration and reuse of the historic buildings

6230890 it looks like a very very solid offering from palm it doesnt come a moment too soon it comes at time when they need to refresh the treo brand as the premium brand relative to the centro

6230911 without the support of these grants many outstanding faculty members would not have the financial resources to participate in professional meetings essential to their scholarship
6230912 tenure eligible faculty are building their academic portfolios and establishing their research base

6230919 it was a wonderful opportunity to learn about what the government is looking for in graduates and what they need to do right now in the united states to remain competitive
6230920 if our graduates have that kind of experience theyre going to better serve our country thats the bottom line
6230921 it was a learning experience my interest is to pass the information along to my colleagues and students i work with

6230930 he and shaun are going to go out there and compete and the winner of that is going to be a good quarterback for us
6230931 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6230932 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6230933 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6230934 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6230935 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us

6230988 of course the officials will say the schools are not going to close but they are in effect crippled because one sole teacher on duty does not constitute an open school by any means

6231087 in the first half of 2008 copper was 6 2 per cent higher on average than in the previous six months while zinc was 31 7 per cent lower
6231088 this outcome combined with the generally higher operating costs we reported in the quarterly report has been the primary reason that the financial performance we are reporting today is not better
6231089 we are reluctant to raise prices in japan because the market is so sluggish
6231090 we expect the current property market volatility to remain for the foreseeable future with the timing of recovery in property markets in the us and uk dependent on the recovery of liquidity in the financial markets
6231091 the us and uk residential markets continue to suffer from lack of liquidity and inventory overhang

6231105 emergency department care in california who uses it and why
6231106 our emergency room volume is up 10 percent in 2008 without a commensurate increase in population
6231107 when you dont have primary care physicians often people have to go to the emergency room for care
6231108 it stretches the resources that should be focused on true emergency care
6231109 many physicians are not interested in establishing their own private practice
6231110 they are interested in joining an existing group the costs of doing business are high and reimbursement rates for many patients are going to be very low

6231153 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
6231154 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
6231155 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
6231156 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
6231157 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
6231158 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

6231172 our advertisers are realizing we add no value so pleeeeeeeaaase be more interactive
6231173 we have the brightest wittiest and best informed commenters on the web
6231174 as subtle as an earthquake with the filthiest of minds
6231175 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments

6231181 with the dubliners he re energised and refreshed our unique musical heritage he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world
6231182 he noticed she wasn t dead and he put a cord around neck and strangled her
6231183 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable and many of them are gone now
6231184 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognise the talent that he felt was real
6231185 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he opened the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen

6231191 it album art survived from the lp to the cd but if that becomes obsolete then i guess album art wont exist i think it would be a big loss
6231192 the things that pop music was there to do for us have all been done theres nothing to rail against now
6231193 when i was 15 in the north west of england the record cover to me was like a picture window to another world seeing an andy warhol illustration on a velvet underground album was a revelation it was the art of your generation true pop art
6231194 with downloads and everything its just killing the whole art side of music stone dead to be quite honest unless you have 20 20 vision its very hard to read anything written on a cd cover there was something very special about vinyl albums its a great shame
6231195 iconic sleeves can help to sell significant amounts of records
6231196 if a band has put effort into the music why not devote that same meticulousness to the package
6231197 you are creating a sleeve that you want to be as iconic as possible its got to work when its a thumbnail on amazon its got to work on the shelves at tesco and on the racks at hmv
6231198 with bands being able to sell music online it frees designers from the constraints of retailers
6231199 but now what is fantastic is that we see bands selling music online where they can sell either a digital download or offer the option to buy a special packaging version of the product that can be mailed to them that can be any shape any size and any format
6231200 as our national company we should all be proud of opera australia however as it stands now not many people are

6231203 with my work internationally i dont think that you could possibly say i dont have my standards

6231211 we are looking for the particular gene or genes rather that may or may not cause diabetes or kidney disease
6231212 everyone is well aware it could be caused by environmental factors like the lack of exercise or poor diet however sometimes it isnt the obese person in a family who becomes diabetic
6231213 its an honor and a privilege to be back at msu as apart of coach kennedys staff and the racer family
6231214 im excited about the upcoming season and look forward to helping make our student athletes and program better
6231215 he has been a big part of our success here the last two years and his ties to the abdur rahim has a long association with kennedy having played for him at
6231216 where thousands of lgbt people trade unionists and disabled people were slaughtered
6231217 for such a slip to pass unnoticed through writer typesetter printer organisers and distributors without anyone at any stage picking it up must say something

6231219 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6231223 senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
6231224 over and over again he has advocated unconditional withdrawal regardless of the facts on the ground
6231225 mccain has a long track record of supporting a reckless and extreme foreign policy his tendency is to shoot first and ask questions later
6231226 the greatest tests of national security judgment in the last decade have been what do you do about iraq and what do you do about afghanistan and john mccain failed both of those two tests the two most critical tests of national security judgment in the last decade
6231227 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
6231228 send regards to israel i miss it i respect israel and admire it as a country
6231229 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet muhammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death

6231233 i dont think running for office is anything im prepared for or could even prepare myself for
6231234 there is nothing i can even compare it to in my own life i work really long hours and work a lot and have done press tours and junkets but there is nothing like a presidential campaign that i have experienced before i think at one point we visited three different cities in one state in 12 hours its exhausting
6231235 most of the college students showed up to get a picture and an autograph
6231236 but if in the process they did hear my argument or did hear something that resonated with them i dont think its because i am on

6231244 if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6231245 mr ayers was a leader of the weather underground a terrorist group responsible for countless bombings against targets including the u s capitol the pentagon and numerous police stations courthouses and banks
6231246 in mccains 2007 book hard call great decisions and the extraordinary people who made them mccain devotes an entire chapter to solzhenitsyn and his experiences as recounted in the gulag archipelago
6231247 mccain once shook the hand of robert bork nixons attorney general who fired the watergate special prosecutor vote for obama

6231260 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6231261 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6231262 while some state appraisal boards do a good job of enforcement for whatever reason whether it be lack of funding or lack of mandatory licensing requirements more than a few do a poor job
6231263 you know you see all those other people getting their medals watching tv everybody is getting medals every day and you just want one for yourself so hopefully we can bring home that gold medal
6231264 the chinese crowd knows a lot about diving and they love diving it is one of their nations biggest sports so they are very interesting and they really love their chinese divers but the great part is they respect the divers from other countries and when they do hard dives or when they do really good dives they will cheer you on as well so it is definitely a good atmosphere
6231265 they will probably have a lot of pressure i am sure some of them might crack a little bit under it but you are going to see a lot of them hold up to it as well so it will be interesting to watch what happens but i think that is also a good opportunity for us to go in there and try to put pressure on them and dive really well and kind of see where they fall
6231266 for me the easiest i think would be shooting it is something that i have done well at and was able to just pick up pretty easily and then the most difficult is fencing because it is a combat sport you are going against somebody i have fenced for five years but if i am going against somebody who has fenced for 15 years they are going to have a little bit more experience so a little bit more of an advantage
6231267 i was kind of surprised that a number of people had asked if i would consider running and they were urging me to run
6231268 i am not looking for another public job ive had the highest job in the state this would be a call to public service
6231269 i think theres a lot of people that love this city and hes one of them
6231270 i dont think that anyone who has been mentioned has an advantage over anyone else in fact the advantage may go to the person who has yet to announce
6231271 i was encouraged when i saw mccain do what hes doing and thats a much more rigorous job it should not be about age

6231278 so those rainfall events that we saw this year on the murray darling system in queensland allowed environmental flows to go across the border into new south wales before our irrigators took water
6231279 we are the only state that does that and our irrigators stuck to those rules
6231280 queensland irrigators for the first time in many many years have enjoyed flow events on our side of the murray darling basin and to penalise them because rain has fallen in queensland i think is wrong

6231287 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6231288 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6231289 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6231298 their big thing was getting me on my back leg and making sure i used it i had become a really tall and fall pitcher and i had taken my legs out of it completely and a guy with my size and body type that puts way too much stress on my arm and i dont have the muscle or frame to support all that so if im not using every bit of everything i can with my mechanics everything is going to fall apart that was kind of like the early link that set everything else in motion

6231303 you can imagine that the rate of production that we are now at its been some achievement to keep that going in that period to make sure that we deliver on time
6231304 the new limited edition green wireless controller offers enhancements to d pad functionality which will add to the experience of playing games where the d pad is the primary control mechanism were always looking to improve products and we made these changes based on feedback from gamers
6231305 a limited edition promotional item that is only available in europe asia and latin america while supplies last
6231306 corporations have created a distrust in municipal tap water systems by marketing their products as the only healthy way to drink water
6231307 we see bottled water as a redundant product its not needed we have good tap water in canada if people have concerns about chlorine in the water or other issues there are filters that are designed to take that out
6231308 bottled water just represents the most ridiculous product that has been mass marketed in the last 15 years when we can get tap water out of our taps at home
6231309 theres any number of instances when tap water just isnt available
6231310 really bottled water provides a convenient safe and healthy hydration option when youre on the go
6231311 it takes significantly more energy to produce than a single use container youve got to wash it out which requires hot water it requires soap to clean if you take a look at it in some cases its almost a wash in terms of the environmental benefit of using a reusable over a single use
6231312 its completely ridiculous to say that a reusable water bottle is as environmentally damaging as a plastic petroleum based bottle that has been filled with water somewhere across the continent and shipped to your store where you drive to buy it it doesnt make any sense
6231313 in looking at the broad culinary food beverage health nutrition world we saw that it did fit the model
6231314 the sharing of recipes goes back to cavemen writing on the walls
6231315 what were seeing as time goes by is the gap between the two does start to close up in the middle
6231316 were starting to see more and more importantly better user generated content percolating up
6231317 it is becoming clearer by the day that internet users are increasingly turning to online live broadcasts as their first port of call when looking at important news stories developing around the world
6231318 with no need for satellite dishes pointing in the right direction set top boxes smart cards and expensive subscriptions people can now watch what matters most to them on their computers anywhere in the world
6231319 add to that the choice of channels available at the click of a mouse means that viewers watching live tv over the internet can benefit from the different perspectives offered by the leading broadcasters
6231320 as you may or may not know ill be playing at this years hard working class heroes festival in dublin this year i will be showcasing my music in the hub on sunday 14th sept
6231321 i dont question senator obamas patriotism i question his judgment
6231322 discuss comments made by senator mccain president bushs biggest supporter of the iraq war regarding his own judgment on the war and his continued efforts to question senator obamas patriotism
6231323 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff
6231324 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6231325 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6231326 one way of boosting recycling might be to offer top recyclers smaller bins to demonstrate they have reduced their waste it gives people an aspiration to throw less away
6231327 it can make people slightly obsessive about turning things off
6231328 the sign portrays a small proportion of the older generation
6231329 we intend to hold a peaceful demonstration where we will be arrested
6231330 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6231331 i am not getting back on the plane with all the press there
6231332 and im not going to london you cant make me i have done my time i am a free man
6231333 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6231334 along the way in this event and through other conversations ive had with athletes i picked up on several observations that only an athlete would know
6231335 myngle charges 18 commission per lesson when you start teaching this fee is charged for use of myngles platform and services paypal fees and includes vat
6231336 blackjack has always been one of bodogs most popular casino games

6231339 you have to mention swizz when you talk about the top five hip hop producers of all time
6231340 the problem becomes convincing the group that this is a priority

6231345 i think richard samuel is probably a very outstanding candidate for kickoff return
6231346 by them being out it allows me to get more reps let coaches see my ability see where im lacking see what i need to improve on
6231347 im looking at as a close competition studying my plays and making sure i look over everything make sure im doing everything right
6231348 but im also going out and doing my very best at everything else doing what the coaches taught me and whatever happens happens
6231349 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6231350 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6231351 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6231352 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6231353 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6231354 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6231355 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6231356 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower
6231357 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6231358 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t
6231359 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6231360 apple released a patch we dont know if it works or not
6231361 heres an example iphone 1 no service iphone 2 106 dbm iphone 3 103 dbm iphone 4 no service iphone 5 106 dbm swisscom field test equipment nokia 3g transceiver 72 dbm swisscom field test equipment samsung 3g receiver 74 dbm swisscom field test equipment s e 3g receiver 76 dbm swisscom usb 3g stick hp notebook 71 dbm swisscom pc card dell notebook 79 dbm
6231362 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6231363 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6231364 is that 19 9 dividend yield for american capital a typo
6231365 has been unduly hurt by the subprime mortgage and credit woes decimating financial stocks
6231366 the credit crunch and resulting lower valuations should prove beneficial to american capital in being able to invest at attractive valued opportunities the high dividend funded through 2009 provides strong downside protection
6231367 ive got to make sure i push myself every day to keep my starting job
6231368 coach stacy searels hell switch you if youre not doing your job and i just dont want to take that chance
6231369 vince has done a very nice job at left guard to the point where were trying to keep from moving him out to disrupt that
6231370 the two guys that have been the most consistent inside have been vance and chris
6231371 you look at vince hes 6 8 or 6 7 or whatever he is and 320 pounds vince has got to cut it loose
6231372 once i switched to the left side he helped me you need to do this
6231373 searels is on him but he can handle it better than before
6231374 he seems to be more mature and more focused on getting the job done doing it right stop making up excuses and lets go
6231375 i know how to fire off the ball and hit somebody
6231376 but this year ive improved on my technique a whole lot off of his coaching
6231377 hes got the ability to be a great offensive guard
6231378 its just taking what coach searels tells us and putting it on the field i think he has what it takes to be all sec if not all american its just a willingness to learn its all up to him
6231379 all i can tell you about him is were going to get him in the game i dont know when but well get him in the game
6231380 greens still got a long way to go theres still some things he just does naturally extremely well but theres still that learning curve to try to understand the offense a particular route how we want it run how we want it run against different coverages theres lot of nuances hes got to get comfortable with but its good to get him back going
6231381 you will be seeing many more new members of the linux foundation in the near future
6231382 were glad hes coming in and we look forward to him being a ram for a long time and getting a deal done
6231383 its obviously a good sign and i feel good about it now
6231384 the goal is to get it resolved and get ready for the season
6231385 all public criticism can do is to harm things by making it personal
6231386 its going to be a fun game this year i know coach urban meyer wants it bad and our players want it bad they are predicting that its going to be the game of the year
6231387 its bad enough that theyre bringing the no 1 team here they are going to bring a crowd too
6231388 the guy at stanford jim harbaugh has done a really good job
6231389 and south carolina coach steve spurrier is pretty tough at home we both have a lot of work to do before we play
6231390 i like the way john parker has responded to this
6231391 we want him to feel more comfortable and this is a good way to do it
6231392 tommy can make all the throws but we probably need to cut things down a little bit
6231393 i dont really care if anybody knows who our starting lineup is im still not sure if thats how were going to end up but thats how wed be if they played today or tomorrow
6231394 vince has done a very nice job at left guard to the point were trying to keep from moving him out to disrupt that
6231395 a lot in his play and a lot in his practice demeanor hes handling coaching so much better more mature and more focused made a lot of strides that way
6231396 i asked him most players say im going tomorrow but hopefully hell go tomorrow
6231397 just kind of a deep bone bruise that sometimes can be helped out with medicine sometimes it cant
6231398 hes got to suck it up on this one a little bit
6231399 wat we nu zien is een duidelijke hergroepering en ook opnieuw een soort misleidingscampagne
6231400 its often very difficult with residences such as this to have a definitive list of people who were in the building and afterwards to determine precisely their whereabouts
6231401 we would be bona fide idiots not to consider him for the show
6231402 i havent been approached about it at all if they asked me its something i would consider
6231403 you go into a process like this and you have no idea what to expect from it me being this regular single dad from seattle you have no idea but you can really find somebody in a show like that if they look for the right people to cast anything is possible
6231404 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6231405 we want to make sure that we dont just have it on the schedule announce it and then be like oh now weve got to find the guy
6231406 the fact that people were up there kicking the tires means nothing from a financial standpoint and therefore really shouldnt really play into what the price of these stocks is doing today
6231407 we were not hosting this tour it was not our initiative we were simply asked by a third party to go up there and give a broad overview which we did
6231408 its nothing new capp does these presentations often to a very wide demographic be it media politicians or investors this was no different
6231409 seem to be focusing on the gasoline demand number within it and ignoring the very large buildup of crude oil on the week
6231410 thats a very popular trip for all sorts of people to take in the investment community
6231411 people who are interested in the future of oil in north america have trekked up to the oilsands to see what they look like
6231412 everybody thought the oil price was coming down and the oil market is relatively tight
6231413 were just having a bounce back because everything was insanely negative two days ago
6231414 well make anyone the mole so you cant rule anyone out next season
6231415 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6231416 quando ele largou com aquela velocidade fiquei de boca aberta foi uma largada muito melhor do que nos 100m

6231421 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
6231422 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice
6231423 summer sizzle heats up the ice as fans await start of 2008 09 nhl season
6231424 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6231425 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6231426 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6231427 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6231428 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6231429 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6231430 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6231431 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6231432 i support constructive continuing cooperation and dialogue among the states and the water users in a manner that is fully consistent with the compact
6231433 a federally driven scheme to reopen the compact would run afoul of my long held respect for the importance of state law and local prerogatives in the allocation of water resources
6231434 any effort to try to amend the compact in the way that was suggested by sen mccain is something that would only happen over my dead body
6231435 it has to demonstrate in my mind a bias for the lower basin states
6231436 the senator is proud and happy to support senator mccain for the presidency but he disagrees with him on this water issue the compact should not be reopened
6231437 represents the definitive and conclusive commitment by senator mccain to protect and preserve the compact
6231438 i was pretty sure there had been some sort of misunderstanding
6231439 it kind of surprised me that a presidential candidate who has already professed that colorado will be a key state to his election effort would make a comment like that
6231440 he was teetering on the edge there i think of getting into real trouble and seems to have pulled back just in time
6231441 we can stop speculating in terms of a review were going to find out
6231442 we need to give them the benefit of the doubt i think theyre going to do the right thing
6231443 within ipg imaging and printing group we are focused on reducing our cost with ongoing initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and lower product costs
6231444 we are investing these savings in targeted growth areas including the enterprise and graphic arts we will continue to be prudent in our pursuit of lower end units and will balance growth and profitability to drive long term results
6231445 you look at a home today instead of having a printer wired through every desktop pc you now see many families integrating into one printer or two printers that are networked around the home we had a 150 percent growth in our wireless printer category this year
6231446 therefore we would be quite aggressive in pursuing that market segment in a way that we think makes sense
6231447 that we would differentiate from a very very low end laser with a very low end connect rate in a single function world that probably wouldnt bring us much long term value
6231448 i think what we want to do is grow in the graphic segment we think it is a very strategic segment but i wouldnt think of it as us stopping doing this to be able to do that
6231449 love is not always like a fairytale there are people who give so much love to those who dont love them back there are some who feel so loved and find out in the end that they were fooled there are some whos into mutual love but cant call their partner as their own because someone already holds the title there are some who gives so much love but the other wont believe because they always consider your past there are some who receive so much love but cant seem to move on from previous relationship or others just want to play the game and choose their playmate
6231450 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 per cent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events
6231451 these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6231452 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well capital positions are well above the minimum levels required by regulation
6231453 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6231454 the marriages between capitalism and education and capitalism and science have created a foundation for science education that emphasizes corporate values at the expense of social justice and human dignity
6231455 science pedagogy framed around social justice concerns can become a medium to transform individuals schools communities the environment and science itself in ways that promote equity and social justice creating a science education that is transformative implies not only how science is a political activity but also the ways in which students might see and use science and science education in ways transformative of the institutional and interpersonal power structures that play a role in their lives
6231456 there neither is nor has ever been an educational practice in zero space time neutral in the sense of being committed only to preponderantly abstract intangible ideas
6231457 does not conceal in fact which proclaims its own political character
6231458 that guy who lives in my neighborhood behind the ayers obama relationship
6231459 this was similar to improvement across the system there were no statistically significant differences in student achievement between annenberg schools and demographically similar non annenberg schools this indicates that there was no annenberg effect on achievement

6231476 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
6231477 people are starting to look at hey is this a takeout candidate
6231478 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
6231479 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
6231480 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
6231481 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
6231482 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
6231483 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
6231484 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
6231485 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
6231486 unless theres some need to im not about debating people
6231487 theyll be very clear that if they read the book that its not about self but about contribution
6231488 core values that you operate from even when no ones looking
6231489 if were enough wed all be skinny rich and happy
6231490 to make change in a human being you have to change the heart and that requires usually some kind of an emotional experience
6231491 sometimes you get your posterior handed to you you have to train yourself
6231492 we are reluctant to raise prices in japan because the market is so sluggish
6231493 some companies may become more protective of their cash amid the current economic slowdown but depressed equity prices will drive a continuation of large buybacks and acquisitions
6231494 i have heard nothing to lead me to conclude that either candidate would abandon the doha round
6231495 there are only a handful of us who are political appointees the folks who have developed these negotiating positions the senior officials who represent the united states year in year out in geneva are for the most part career officials
6231496 if we are going to have chance of reaching a near term conclusion
6231497 there are always going to be elections there are always going to be politics intervening
6231498 if there is a deal out there that meets those criteria i dont care when it shows up
6231499 we have to go for it it cant be dictated by our electoral cycle or anyone elses
6231500 f r att en g ng kunna leva m ste man f rst verleva
6231501 i think we will be able to keep up with the pace i think our capacity is more than enough
6231502 we dont anticipate problems with those people but anytime you plan for an event like this there are also groups out there who may be more violent
6231503 whats important is that the processing is efficient enough that people arent unreasonably delayed in their right to post bond get out of there and answer those questions in court
6231504 its actually being sold to somebody so all this goes away
6231505 the hole increased in size to put two suburbans inside without seeing them
6231506 we control the amount of water going through the pipe thus minimizing damage downstream
6231507 stuff happens so you just deal with it the best you can
6231508 consistent with conditions in the broader economy advertising markets have slowed in the new financial year
6231509 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6231510 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand
6231511 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth
6231512 oz minerals operational performance has been very sound and as reported in our recent quarterly report production volumes at all sites has been strong
6231513 however lme prices for copper and zinc in australian us dollars have been volatile
6231514 in the first half of 2008 copper was 6 2 per cent higher on average than in the previous six months while zinc was 31 7 per cent lower
6231515 this outcome combined with the generally higher operating costs we reported in the quarterly report has been the primary reason that the financial performance we are reporting today is not better
6231516 notwithstanding the negative impact of commodity price movements on our short term performance the long term demand strength that we and many participants in the minerals industry have referred to many times remains intact and oz minerals is exceptionally well positioned to benefit
6231517 we expect the current property market volatility to remain for the foreseeable future with the timing of recovery in property markets in the us and uk dependent on the recovery of liquidity in the financial markets
6231518 the us and uk residential markets continue to suffer from lack of liquidity and inventory overhang
6231519 in comparison the australian market is stronger and while slowing should not see the same level of impact
6231520 our strong positive cashflow combined with capital recycling has provided cash on hand of a 842 8 million allowing us to continue to fund our investment pipeline while exploring growth opportunities
6231521 mr clarke had given the company a commitment of between five to seven years when he was appointed in december 2002

6231523 it is always difficult to predict how long such searches will take however we are pleased with progress to date
6231524 there are a couple of surprises we want to keep under our hat
6231525 were really putting the finishing touches on the convention hall vacuuming carpets and putting the last drops of paint on the state delegation signs
6231526 and ive spent some time inside the pepsi center but i forwent the olympics to help our news team cover the convention
6231527 i think people will be astonished at what weve done to transform this sports arena into a convention hall
6231528 it doesnt look like anything youve seen before at a nuggets game
6231529 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6231530 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6231531 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6231532 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
6231533 whilst it will have no massive effect on interstate or the federal governments decisions it will show that we as an association arent doing what we should be and standing together to work against this drought
6231534 once the lakes are filled with salt water i believe that everyone above lock 1 will say see you didnt need fresh water and i also believe that as a ramsar site we should be doing everything we can in south australia to protect the ramsar wetlands site
6231535 the senate is a very powerful entity the constitution gives it the power to get this information so therell be no harm done here if both the audits end up the same way
6231536 an inquiry doesnt have to take a long time the information is there
6231537 what the inquiry has got to do is get hold of that information its not calling for more studies its calling for information about water volumes water quality availability transferability and the cost of it
6231538 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6231539 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6231540 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6231541 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6231542 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6231543 this is a historic agreement that will help us to recruit and retain experienced rns to our hospitals
6231544 meal and break relief rns will mean our patients will be taken care of safely and within the requirement of existing state law and nurses will finally be able to take needed rest and meal breaks
6231545 this settlement is a demonstration of the unity and commitment of sutter rns throughout northern california to win provisions in our contracts that will enhance our ability to provide safe quality care to our patients and our communities
6231546 rns will also get assistance with patient handling from trained personnel which will help both patients and nurses
6231547 california pacific medical center st lukes hospital appears to be going in the opposite direction with their most recent regressive proposal on healthcare
6231548 the last bargaining session we had with them was on july 31st we were hopeful that given the positive outcome of the blue ribbon panel findings to maintain st lukes as a full service acute care hospital and management stating they looked forward to a new relationship that the bargaining session would be more positive instead they put forward a proposal which does not provide rns healthcare security but rather allows management to make unilateral changes at any time this is on the heels of an arbitration ruling against sutter for raising co payments and drug costs mid contract and requiring that cpmc must repay the rns and cpmc continues to refuse to comply
6231549 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6231550 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6231551 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6231552 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6231553 how can we have an entire industry out there under threat because we cant get people to work here
6231554 i just take it on faith that what the bible says is true
6231555 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6231556 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6231557 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6231558 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6231559 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6231560 this is exceptional circumstances and it really was a decision taken only because there were no other placement options available at the time
6231561 while we think this is very very undesirable and exceptionally rare it was the only option available to our caseworkers at the time
6231562 this is my first deployment and i am ready to go i have one son that is over there now and my youngest son is in germany and he will be coming over in the next year
6231563 the youngest son who is over there right now this is his second tour so we have been talking a lot and he has been giving me some pointers
6231564 we have now completed our training here in the garrison environment and are deploying into iraq
6231565 we will un case the colors when we arrive there signifying we are ready to execute our missions
6231566 part of that strength will increase in the first 30 days because we have soldiers back here that have dwell issues
6231567 i am just ready to go that was the first thing i asked my sergeant major when i got here
6231568 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6231569 we are planning a larger long term study that will be international in the united states and canada and also in europe
6231570 we selected the best ones did chemistry to modify them and came up with ptc124
6231571 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6231572 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6231573 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6231574 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6231575 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6231576 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6231577 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6231578 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6231579 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6231580 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6231581 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6231582 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6231583 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6231584 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6231585 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6231586 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6231587 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6231588 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6231589 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6231590 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6231591 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6231592 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6231593 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6231594 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6231595 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6231596 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6231597 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6231598 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6231599 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6231600 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6231601 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6231602 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6231603 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6231604 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6231605 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6231606 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6231607 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6231608 who are open to doing something on the production side
6231609 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6231610 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6231611 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6231612 we are so happy that we have made the people of georgia proud with this win after all our troubles back home
6231613 wales are not a small footballing nation and to win is the best day of my life
6231614 its a big result for the country and our new manager hector cuper in his first match because he has now seen the players and will be able to put them in their best positions
6231615 we will expect a similar game with ireland as we got from wales they play with a similar style of play and system to the rest of the british isles
6231616 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6231617 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6231618 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6231619 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6231620 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6231621 ive heard from novell sales representatives that microsoft sales executives have started calling the suse linux enterprise server coupons
6231622 a lthough the companies announced the incremental investment on august 20 hauser said the investments will not take effect until nov 1 2008 and between now and then microsoft and novell will solicit customer input on various aspects of the effort
6231623 the boston globe article also quotes microsofts pay to say al gillen
6231624 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6231625 official unofficial syrian intellectuals to come to washington and lobby on behalf of the regime
6231626 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama
6231627 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government ambassador kurtzers trip had no connection with the campaign
6231628 we have a protocol a custom informally around here that we dont criticize the president when hes on foreign soil
6231629 one would think that would apply to the president that he would not criticize americans barack obama when he is on foreign soil
6231630 both barack obama and hillary clinton had sent representatives to the international conference in jerusalem to solicit campaign supporters in israel
6231631 clintons was ex ambassador to israel martin indyk and obamas were dennis ross formerly of the us state department and ex special middle east envoy and dan kurtzer another former ambassador to israel
6231632 whereas indyk kept a low profile ross and kurtzer were in and out of the offices of israeli leaders including prime minister ehud olmert they promised that israel had nothing to fear from barack obama as president or his offer to meet the presidents of iran and syria for face to face discussion on the issues outstanding between them and the united states they insisted that this offer did not apply to palestinian terrorists like hamas
6231633 two representatives of the united states previous administration on tuesday criticized the policies of current u s president george w bush and the conduct of the annapolis middle east peace process
6231634 special middle east coordinator in the clinton administration dennis ross and former u
6231635 kurtzer an adviser on foreign policy and the middle east to democratic presidential hopeful senator barack obama criticized the annapolis process and said the current administration in washington is not seriously advancing the negotiations
6231636 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6231637 i appreciate that the governor now believes that we need more revenues and well keep working with him and the other legislative leaders to craft a balanced budget
6231638 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6231639 assembly republicans continue to oppose tax increases because they will hurt families kill jobs hinder our economic growth and feed the democrats addiction to higher spending
6231640 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6231641 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6231642 yesterdays curriculum will not prepare todays students for tomorrows challenges
6231643 two watchwords provided by the mandates of the north dakota roundtable on higher education governed our decision and those words are accessibility and affordability
6231644 there is a legislative expectation that universities contribute to the economic vitality of the regions they serve
6231645 the strom center will help us greatly to meet that expectation
6231646 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6231647 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6231648 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6231649 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6231650 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6231651 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6231652 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6231653 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6231654 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6231655 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6231656 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain
6231657 as far as were concerned shes still here until further notice and until the lord says its her time to go
6231658 she is a passionate and tireless advocate for the people of cleveland and a devoted public servant for all americans
6231659 we send our heartfelt prayers to stephanie and her family at this very difficult time
6231660 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6231661 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6231662 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6231663 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6231664 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6231665 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6231666 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6231667 luto y solidaridad con todos los afectados por este funesto accidente
6231668 su p same y condolencias a todas las personas cercanas a los fallecidos
6231669 the great thing about this problem is that st anthonys owns the building so if the city could come in they could get another provider to run it and they could continue the services
6231670 if were going to allocate additional resources its going to be focused on permanent supportive housing because we know thats what works
6231671 he has the ability to articulate an economic policy to people
6231672 i think mitt romney can fit that need and balance the ticket
6231673 he forged a public persona thats stronger and deeper that what might emerge out of a traditional campaign
6231674 the american public has seen john mccain warts and all they know who he is
6231675 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6231676 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6231677 he is not going to be constrained by a law he passed intended to demonstrate his moral superiority over previous prime ministers whom he lambasted for doing exactly what he now contemplates bringing down his own government at a time of his choosing
6231678 its completely absurd its character assassination its disgraceful from top to bottom how do you respond to this kind of gutter snipe politics
6231679 seemed to be calibrating policy in a way that happened to benefit ultimately himself and special interests
6231680 i think its fair to assume his views are coloured by his own personal financial stake
6231681 prime minister harpers approach isnt to consider his own financial interests or those of powerful friends commercial interests but rather to advance canadas overall economic and national interests and to articulate our values not just with china but in general
6231682 this is a policy difference between two parties about how to engage china
6231683 most canadians understand we can walk and chew gum at the same time
6231684 we can pursue our commercial interests in a thoughtful and businesslike fashion without selling out on belief in human rights and religious freedom
6231685 to make the suggestion that any prime minister who wants to engage china when the rest of the world is engaging with china is doing it for personal reasons is something that is just the type of attack that one would expect from jason kenney
6231686 is this because david emmerson was in the forest industry
6231687 i dont think so i think its because its the right policy the idea that anybody is doing it for personal gain is absolute nonsense
6231688 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6231689 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6231690 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6231691 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6231692 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6231693 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6231694 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6231695 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6231696 si colmi di fragore nellassaporare tali piaceri si colmi di fantasie e follie dolci talmente intensi di fascino che la mente spegne il corpo rinasce nel risuonare in versi versi di godimento che non placano e sempre accelerano i sensi
6231697 non fermarti che la tua carne fa vibrare il mio peccato tu rosa di fuoco quando ti tocco lasci limpronta del tuo corpo che segna ogni tuo movimento di donna mentre sento i tuoi respiri gemiti che la gola fanno seccare io trovo pazzia la tua pelle come seta carezzante parti di me che fai ululare irrigidire divampare con labbra che sai gestire non oso osservare la movenza esaltante lenta e pungente destasi
6231698 quando la notte cala torno alla nostra dimora nel buio di queste stanze vedo te in piedi nelle vesti di una dea spettinata ma aggraziata nei gesti ti allunghi in quei passi silenziosi di giovinezza ed i tuoi cosi profondi occhi la tua voce un sibilo di dolcezza il tuo corpo un dipindo di passione di un colore che nellombra stessa irradia lo sguardo di chi losserva
6231699 ti ho vista danzare sembravi farfalla bianca come neve trasparente come acqua ti ho vista danzare ti ho voluta sviorare splendida luce di vita sono solo un uomo ma dinanzi a te sono larcobaleno dei tuoi viaggi di fata

6231703 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
6231704 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6231705 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6231706 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6231707 ive heard from novell sales representatives that microsoft sales executives have started calling the suse linux enterprise server coupons
6231708 a lthough the companies announced the incremental investment on august 20 hauser said the investments will not take effect until nov 1 2008 and between now and then microsoft and novell will solicit customer input on various aspects of the effort
6231709 the boston globe article also quotes microsofts pay to say al gillen
6231710 hay una crisis contra los periodistas violencia asesinatos desapariciones amenazas de parte del narcotr fico y tambi n de gobiernos locales aunados a la impunidad al miedo y a la autocensura
6231711 m xico ha entrado en una crisis de periodistas el pa s ha estado en una confrontaci n con el crimen organizado y el narcotr fico y adem s la situaci n se ha agravado porque el presidente calder n decidi que el ej rcito participara en tareas de seguridad lo que ha provocado muchas violaciones a derechos humanos
6231712 el gobierno tiene que sancionar a los responsables de los asesinatos tiene que investigar y hacer justicia es un llamado de la comunidad internacional porque hemos visto una omisi n completa del gobierno federal en la crisis que se vive en el pa s
6231713 buscamos que haya mejor coordinaci n entre los gobiernos para que se investigue
6231714 hay 24 asesinatos en brasil los periodistas nos reunimos para crear unidad en el medio para pelear por la seguridad
6231715 si un periodista es asesinado en guerrero tiene que importarle a todos los medios tiene que haber unidad y el gobierno tiene que estar haciendo su trabajo
6231716 in january the then culture secretary categorically promised the commons there would be no more lottery raids to pay for their olympics budget miscalculations
6231717 six months later that promise has been torn up every time the lottery is raided less money goes into grassroots sport yet this is the only way we will secure a legacy for everyone from the 2012 olympics
6231718 funding for our athletes in athens was primarily lottery money in beijing both lottery and exchequer
6231719 for london the package will be lottery exchequer and business
6231720 following our successes in beijing we have great ambitions for our athletes in 2012 and are determined to make sure that investment is in place
6231721 can gordon brown not see there is something fundamentally short sighted in funding the british team by raiding the money going to local and community sports clubs
6231722 if the government had started raising this money earlier our athletes could have had the funding certainty they need without raiding grassroots sports
6231723 what do you want to be when you grow up
6231724 while the run production generated by these two veterans griffey and dunn will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6231725 those were our two best players and the guys who actually got what few fans we have left to come to the ballpark so yeah were in trouble but we have hope for next year i am a broken record
6231726 since taking ownership of this franchise we have aggressively tried to improve our major league roster for the purpose of restoring championship baseball to cincinnati we have sought and signed proven players we have extended the contracts of select current players we added dusty baker a proven winning manager and we have capitalized on our burgeoning younger players like joey votto jay bruce and johnny cueto
6231727 well were trying what the hell else do you want results we got dusty oh wait we got dusty fuck those burgeoning younger players are screwed
6231728 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top we appreciate your support and look forward to seeing you at the ballpark
6231729 basically weve mailed it in were running out whoever wants to play wherever maybe theyll get a hit or something oh yeah please come out and spend 100 a night to watch these sacks of garbage
6231730 he has filed as an independent and the rules are very clear one thousand dollars
6231731 the problem is the campaign finance law in vermont seems to be a little fuzzy there are some people that say were reverting to the 1996 law others say were staying with the 1997 law theres a lot of different opinions as to what the law actually is
6231732 there is a campaign finance law on the books in vermont and that is the law that applies if he has an argument that it should not apply he should do something about it
6231733 it was a good idea until the zebra mussels came along in lake champlain they attached to the tires creating a lot of weight the people with marinas had more and more trouble maintaining their floating tire breakwater
6231734 the tires were allowed to deteriorate break loose the tires were just inflated with air and when the tire sidewall went out the flotation fails the tires sink to the bottom
6231735 there is a program in the state of new york called the waste tire management program whose main criteria is how close are the tires to a body of water i dont know is in the water close enough
6231736 the ones we have are in about 14 to 17 feet of water way below the navigation level and not causing a problem however we think we should get them out
6231737 were looking forward to doing batman this year because the movie was such a success
6231738 the weather has been beautiful the last couple of days so setup has gone well and the long range forecast is excellent so were encouraged
6231739 what they have right now is a 200 000 gallon a day lagoon facility which is basically just big lagoons to treat the waste water and what we need for capacity and the stream quality is an upgraded plant
6231740 you know every so often you have to argue in the congress that rural america is a very very important part of america i think its the soul of america
6231741 without the treatment facility expansion jay peak could not grow at all and we would never be able to evolve into a year round facility which is critical to our community and our staff
6231742 with the release of the new platform the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position
6231743 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nationwide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6231744 strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6231745 the forward order book it gives allows us to take a long term strategic view
6231746 we will work with the mod to ensure the uk has the necessary skills and resources not only to support existing usage patterns but also to be able to increase output and design new types of ammunition when required
6231747 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunition to our armed forces
6231748 difficult times call for extreme measures and its clear that some people wont be splashing out on luxuries in the near future people still want quality but its all about value for money
6231749 locking both low income pupils and vocational education into second class status
6231750 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6231751 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses
6231752 there are many paths to success including vocational as well as academic options indeed 85 per cent of employers would encourage young people to take vocational qualifications

6231762 fixed an issue that could allow cross site scripting as reported by chris weber of casaba security details will be disclosed at a later date
6231763 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
6231764 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
6231765 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage
6231766 but theyve brought a little bit of a headache too
6231767 i dont appreciate these meetings and im in the dark
6231768 they have to show results im satisfied with the results so far but im always guarded for the future
6231769 i think it still lacks i dont know what it is
6231770 something needs to be done to solidify or pull it all together its too generic its too vanilla
6231771 it became obvious to us that its now time to make sure we align our vision with that of the city as a whole
6231772 we all want to leave this place better than how we found it
6231773 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6231778 iraq is fast becoming one of the united states top customers for military sales
6231779 since january 2007 iraq has spent 3 1 billion on u s weapons that number looks likely to grow exponentially as iraq uses its vast unspent reserves of petrodollars to develop its army into a force capable of defending its borders against hostile neighbors
6231780 in the past two months alone the pentagon has alerted congress of a possible 8 7 billion worth of additional military sales to iraq for everything from lightweight attack helicopters to armored ambulances to binoculars
6231781 is considering buying 140 of the united states most advanced tanks at approximately 4 million to 5 million per tank plus hundreds of millions of dollars worth of support equipment to go along with the tanks

6231785 texas really needs a large scale production facility and i mean large to be competitive
6231786 i would say that its going to be a mixture of what do you think do you go downtown if you do why what would bring you downtown were just trying to get a sense of how do we enhance it
6231787 its the downtown its part of the city and its their opportunity to give their own input and its anonymous it is completely anonymous i have no idea who theyre going to be asking
6231788 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6231789 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
6231790 he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
6231791 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
6231792 according to recent allegations in your capacity as the former cia deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the near east division you were tasked by former cia director george tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the white house stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written
6231793 given your reported direct knowledge of these events i am requesting that you contact judiciary committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter

6231803 the possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery there is always more mystery
6231804 f k s magazine i come from denmark making me danish i feature the work of many interesting photographers and lots and lots of naked watsons dictionary of weasel words contemporary cliches cant amp management jargon in a world where people rarely say what they mean or mean what they say its vital that we have a document such as don watsons weasel words according to ernie dingo and the northern territory tourism board youll never never know if you never never go
6231805 security forces fired at militant positions and we have received reports that 10 militants have been killed
6231806 this was portrayed as though there was some big bomb there and there wasnt
6231807 these chemicals had been there for some time and nothing dangerous happened the record in this case speaks for itself
6231808 we had no evidence so there was no way we could have prevailed at that point
6231809 he got an incredible start i just went wow it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100m and his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6231810 he has incredible speed and an incredibly long stride that affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can
6231811 my house has been taken over by more than 100 people from inside and outside the community
6231812 they are waving flags beating drums and just making a lot of noise but this is a special moment and to know that a jamaican has done this and i am the father of that jamaican makes me feel special i never expected him to break the world record but i am proud of my son
6231813 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
6231814 over the last 11 years since this generation of students started at school there has been a transformation in the funding and support for schools and in the attainment that flows from that
6231815 we still have what i term the stubborn 20 who arent reaching the standards we expect in literacy and numeracy by the age of 11
6231816 that figure was nearly twice as large 10 years ago so we have narrowed that proportion significantly but to my mind our biggest challenge over the next few years is to see that all primary school children as early as possible within their primary school years get up to standard in the basics of literacy and numeracy
6231817 there is room for debate on the precise form the tests take but i believe it would be a seriously retrograde step to abandon national tests
6231818 i think also i would herald as a key objective the elimination of underperforming secondary schools
6231819 the key objective of improvement must be to get primary school children up to competence in the basics but it is not acceptable that parents should be faced without a choice of a good quality secondary school in their locality
6231820 essentially they are filler courses before pupils can go on to genuine vocational education
6231821 too many people are being cheated in this government stunt pupils employers the public and all to make the government look like its doing better than it is
6231822 we had a lot of supply teachers coming in so i didnt think the lessons were very good really
6231823 we had all the technology whiteboards projectors and stuff like that but they dont actually help you with maths we had literacy and numeracy hour at primary school so we did basic comprehension maths algebra they separated the groups according to ability i know of the gifted and talented scheme there were special maths lessons in the holidays and visits to oxford and cambridge universities i have an older brother whos now 20 and we both agreed our experience of primary school was better than secondary he also went to st columbus and he had better teachers ones i call old school because they knew how to control the class it all comes down to the teachers
6231824 thats a stupid comment to make i already know that
6231825 be careful there people out there who claim to bring my message but they are really here to destory you
6231826 you will know the real from the fake by the type of life that they live and the outcome of their actions
6231827 we welcome the overall rise in people entering higher education however the incremental increase in the number of poorer students accepting university places is not good enough
6231828 institutions must not be complacent when it comes to widening participation among those groups who have not traditionally attended university
6231829 they must also be careful to give a fair chance to those who have gained qualifications other than a levels but who may nonetheless benefit from higher education
6231830 i am particularly encouraged by the increase in acceptances from lower socioeconomic groups as we continue to work to widen participation in higher education through for example greater links between universities and schools and the aimhigher programme
6231831 we will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions chairman mao made and unswervingly follow whatever instructions chairman mao gave
6231832 just a transition not an epoch his policies were a continuation of the late mao and there was nothing original about him
6231833 we must not squander away the indisputable benefits of the free flow of capital
6231834 two million german jobs depend on foreign investors we want more not less investment
6231835 one way of boosting recycling might be to offer top recyclers smaller bins to demonstrate they have reduced their waste it gives people an aspiration to throw less away
6231836 it can make people slightly obsessive about turning things off
6231837 this a flotation might have been a good way to realise funds but for various practical reasons an ipo was not deemed appropriate
6231838 in the aftermath of that becoming public we did receive several approaches thats because the norwegian business is highly attractive
6231839 but our board has said on two separate occasions its strong preference is ownership of the norwegian business
6231840 this damaging confusion in the midst of an international crisis with one minister saying one thing and another saying the opposite must be immediately cleared up
6231841 what i disagree with is the dangerous behaviour of david cameron in tbilisi when he said georgia should immediately join nato to punish the russians
6231842 the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away

6231853 you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6231854 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6231855 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is no difficulty with that at all

6231862 it should be on record that i said nothing at that meeting absolutely nothing
6231863 all tory mps have been instructed to have no further dealings with the organisation accordingly
6231864 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming why not cycling
6231865 how many of us as parents would let our kids ride on the public roads in britain children need safety and skills and if cycling was on the curriculum as a key life skill so that every kid in britain rides a bike that would be a massive boost to the sport of cycling
6231866 that moment when a parent first pushes their kid off on their bike without stabilisers is a memorable one and weve all done it ride a bike to burn more calories and eat a bit less and youll solve child obesity issues but you have to find the right facility and make it fun for kids
6231867 you do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90 of the work done in parliament on political issues

6231877 the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project
6231878 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones were no more than a show
6231879 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6231880 the idea of demonstration is that you are hoping to resolve issues not to demonstrate for the sake of demonstrating we are pleased that issues have been resolved through dialogue and communication this is how we do it in chinese culture
6231881 we want everyone to express their opinion everyone has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6231882 the olympics are about sport we are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the olympics is a catalyst for development here that catalytic effect is happening but the olympics are not a panacea for all ills
6231883 but though i regard it as established that we cannot prove there is any thought in animals i do not think it is thereby proved that there is not since the human mind does not reach into their hearts
6231884 in my life id had just one puff of a cigarette when i was 10 and spent all of the following day throwing up

6231888 we have a facebook account and we get all kinds of story ideas that come through that

6231892 we saw all these people walking down barton springs road and wondered what all the commotion was about
6231893 i dont get nervous playing in front of big audiences

6231898 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6231899 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6231900 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6231901 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6231902 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6231903 obama has apparently lost some support but we are still in a lock
6231904 weve essentially been in a holding pattern since the nominations were wrapped up

6231909 the rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the heart of jesus our redeemer who so loves his mother
6231910 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and

6231912 we believe we are talking about dozens rather than thousands
6231913 the rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the heart of jesus our redeemer who so loves his mother
6231914 he was just right out of the box mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6231915 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward john mccain

6231925 a lot of times theyll come to this and they might be used to crossing it a certain way this time it might be a confusion to them of what to do
6231926 all you have to do is push the button and go
6231927 if they can find another safer route that would be my suggestion
6231928 if you walk straight across here in the turning lane most of them dont pay attention cause theyre paying attention over here to traffic theyre more worried about turning than anything else

6231940 look at it this way your face will be so fresh you could go horseback riding
6231941 when youre travelling you already do your shopping before you come here there are too many shops
6231942 that the government is interfering with baa seems ridiculous when they were the ones who offered it the licence to operate gatwick and other uk airports in the first place
6231943 could only be a good thing they baa have embraced some of the worst things about pseudo state ownership
6231944 to doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions both dispense with the necessity of reflection
6231945 he was just a funny fun loving guy a great outgoing personality
6231946 theres always been people trying to beef with other people
6231947 the whole macho thing has always been around but apparently its getting worse
6231948 i think that everyone in russia and in the world is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6231949 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6231950 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
6231951 its been easily one of the worst seasons of my life and one of the best at the same time
6231952 i had to clash on numerous occasions i was trying to break away from the brazilians they were quite aggressive sometimes bordering on unsportsmanlike this is swimming after all not boxing
6231953 im third generation british i came to america because ive always wanted to come here and now theyve got me so scared that all i want to do is go home were paying for your stupid war anyway
6231954 it does reduce the number of potential licensees and may put further pressure on arms licensing revenue
6231955 we are open to evaluating the deal but we will wait to see if the terms are attractive
6231956 on the one hand there are plenty of funds out there with money to invest in airports however on the other hand airport valuations have fallen reflecting tighter credit conditions and a more uncertain aviation environment and its never good to be a forced seller we would also expect the uncertainty of changes toughening to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value
6231957 meaningful valuations will be tricky to achieve in the current market though the infrastructure sector has been holding good value
6231958 unravelling the airports from baa so that they are in a position to be sold will also be a mammoth task requiring careful handling
6231959 there will be enormous structural difficulties involving technology property data people contractors service providers pensions etc in separation managing these whilst continuing to operate the airports will not be straightforward
6231960 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6231961 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life
6231962 manufacturers are becoming more downbeat about forthcoming levels of activity but are still having to raise their prices due to the severity of recent cost increases domestic conditions remain sluggish and the recent slowdown in the eurozone economies is starting to make conditions tougher for uk manufacturing exporters although the weaker pound will offer some relief
6231963 would be that an unexpected rate rise might adversely affect business and consumer confidence adding to the near term downside pressures on activity and causing a material undershoot of the inflation target in the medium term although rates could be cut later in that event the downturn would be unnecessarily deep adding to the volatility in the economy
6231964 the main risk associated with an immediate cut was that it could cause wage and price setters to conclude that the committee was more concerned about sustaining output growth than about returning inflation to its target
6231965 given the current stance of monetary policy and the prospective weakness in the economy the resulting increase in spare capacity should bear down on inflation that would help to counter the risk of high inflation in the near term becoming embedded in inflation expectations and to bring inflation back to the target there would however still be significant risks to the inflation outlook
6231966 we will see more and more covered solar cell parking
6231967 youre talking hundreds of feet and not miles for your interconnection
6231968 if your roof is covered with solar cells what are you going to do when it comes time to change your roof
6231969 if you owe taxes for the federal and state its a no brainer
6231970 you basically rinse down the panels and make sure theres not dust on them

6231977 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark
6231978 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43bn
6231979 easily reach 50bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the treasury
6231980 these dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control one test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
6231981 gordon brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence
6231982 all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm

6231988 given its superior exploration and appraisal opportunity set we believe tullow should outperform should the oil price rebound and the markets appetite for exploration exposure return also further exploration success could make tullow a merger and acquisition target next year such is the size and quality of the ghanaian discoveries with potential for additional upside from uganda
6231989 uk gas prices have posted significant gains on news that a pipeline from the kvitebj rn gas field in norway which we estimate comprises 5 of 2008 forecast norwegian gas output was shut down after a leak was discovered this is bullish for dana petroleum tullow and venture production and highlights the jittery nature of the markets to any sign of indigenous supply disruptions

6231998 ngayon kitang kita na natin ang mga paghihirap at pang aapi ng pamahalaan na nakita natin noong rehimen ng martial law laging itinatago ang ginagawa ng pamahalaan sa taumbayan mababa ang tiwala ng taumbayan sa gobyerno magulo na naman sa mindanao at walang respeto sa batas at sa mga karapatan ng bawat tao
6231999 marami sanang leksyon sa kasaysayan ng ating bansa at ng liberal party na natutunan ang ating mga lider at ang taumbayan isa na dito ang katotohanan na kaya nating iangat ang ating bansa mula sa pagkakalugmok sa kahirapan at kawalan ng katahimikan ang kailangan ay isagawa na natin ang mga leksyon ng nakaraan
6232000 we remember the times in our country during and preceding martial law they were dark times for my family and the country plaza miranda was just the beginning of a long 15 year struggle for our freedom it is now 37 years since and our future is once more under a cloud of uncertainty but one thing is for sure we will defend our constitution and the welfare of our people no matter what

6232002 there must be a full accounting by the energy regulatory commission erc whether the total meter deposits of meralco customers including interests earned through the year would amount only to a total of p2 8 billion
6232003 since bill deposits are being collected by power distributors i wonder why meralco is quick in disconnecting consumers who had been delayed in paying a months bill
6232004 the deposit is supposed to be collected to cover such contingencies
6232005 ninoy said he wanted to take the extra mile for peace in the land and convince president ferdinand marcos that it was time to end martial law and restore the country to its democratic moorings
6232006 if it is my fate to die by an assassins bullet so be it
6232007 these are matters of fact that in my mind make ninoy truly a hero a instrument of god of the fates if you like whose death purchased for the nation the rights and liberties that we now enjoy in the country
6232008 he talked fast worked fast and lived fast and the heavens apparent complicity to his agenda of speed in everything that he did opened the gates of opportunity for him
6232009 that observation it must be said was not true at all there were people who fought the martial law regime in various ways some peaceful others violent but it was only the assassination of ninoy that gave a nationally recognizable face to the heroic dimension of our society
6232010 charter change per se is not bad but because of the seeming underhanded intention of the government people are left wondering why charter change is being pushed
6232011 now that the moa is scheduled for a thorough review there is no apparent necessity to revive the call for charter change at this time
6232012 as lawmakers oppose charter change they will unreasonably tie that opposition to cha cha to the collapse of the peace talks

6232033 if all oil company profits were taken away from them it would only lower the price of gasoline by about 20 cents gallon the main driver 70 of gasoline prices is the price of crude oil hopefully we will use high prices to change our dependence on oil instead of just complaining about it

6232035 they however that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord maintain that he preached for one year only and then suffered in the twelfth month in speaking thus they are forgetful of their own disadvantage destroying his whole work and robbing him of that age which is both more necessary and more honorable than any other that more advanced age i mean during which also as a teacher he excelled all others for how could he have had his disciples if he did not teach and how could he have taught unless he had reached the age of a master for when he came to be baptized he had not yet completed his thirtieth year but was beginning to be about thirty years of age and he preached only one year reckoning from his baptism on completing his thirtieth year he suffered being in fact still a young man and who had by no means attained to advanced age now that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years and that this extends onward to the fortieth year every one will admit but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age which our lord possessed while he still fulfilled the office of a teacher even as the gospel and all the elders testify those who were conversant in asia with john the disciple of the lord that john conveyed to them that information and he remained among them up to the time of trajan some of them moreover saw not only john but the other apostles also and heard the very same account from them and bear testimony as to the statement whom then should we rather believe whether such men as these or ptolem us who never saw the apostles and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle
6232036 cannot be touched on every principle of sound criticism and of the doctrine of probabilities it is unimpeachable
6232037 and when we say also that the word who is the first birth of god was produced without sexual union and that he jesus christ our teacher was crucified and died and rose again and ascended into heaven we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of jupiter and if we assert that the word of god was born of god in a peculiar manner different from ordinary generation let this as said above be no extraordinary thing to you who say that mercury is the angelic word of god but if any one objects that he was crucified in this also he is on a par with those reputed sons of jupiter of yours who suffered as we have now enumerated
6232038 but jehovah prospered the seed of the essenians in holiness and love for many generations then came the chief of the angels according to the commandment of god to raise up an heir to the voice of jehovah and in four generations more an heir was born and named joshua and he was the child of joseph and mara devout worshippers of jehovah who stood aloof from all other people save the essenians and this joshua in nazareth reestablished jehovah and restored many of the lost rites and ceremonies in the thirty sixth year of his age he was stoned to death in jerusalem

6232090 no he is a lord the son of someone or other its funny the other chap he works with is called mr soho and he always defers to henry calling him your lordship its caught on now im calling him that too
6232091 but the very reason i wanted to make my new film was that ive lived in london for almost 40 years now and in that period of time its been impossible not to have observed the entire spectrum of the social ladder lord henry and the soho barman i like that i like that about england because its complex within its social fabric i hope the film shows that
6232092 this will be much more popular than revolver its simpler and its fun after revolver im not sure that everything needs to be an analysis of the deeper motivation as to why we get up in the morning
6232093 the majority of times i go to the cinema i want a bit of everything i want to be challenged intellectually and then again i dont want to be too challenged intellectually
6232094 i believe my wife to be very creative so of course im interested in how she thinks

6232098 its fun to look at young people who are playing their hearts out
6232099 the national youth orchestra has a very important role the potential for a kinetic explosive type of energy is endless people want that i was very surprised to hear that the government doesnt support this orchestra at all they get good conductors to work with them to achieve something with programmes that even a lot of symphony orchestras dont get to play this is a unique opportunity for musical growth and human growth
6232100 the sim n bol var orchestra is the most extraordinary musical education project ive seen these kids are in their twenties now and the kids 10 years younger are going to be even better i conducted the planets with an orchestra ranging from seven to 14 in the summer a few years ago it did seem that some notice of the need for music education was taken in britain and it seems to be better now than it was it can save peoples lives in so many different ways
6232101 part of the enjoyment that the audience can have watching a youth orchestra is because its fun to look at young people who are playing their hearts out its like going to the zoo and watching young lions and polar bears however the story that is behind youth orchestras is just as important nowadays in the music business as the quality of the orchestra you are thrilled by the skill of the sim n bol var orchestra and the east western divan but i hope any such institution which is riding upon a wave of attention and hype is sustainable enough that it will remain once the hype is over
6232102 among the young orchestras the verbier festival orchestra is the closest to a high professional level
6232103 the quality of the young orchestras is much higher now probably because the competition to get a job in the music world requires a very high standard i told them after three days of rehearsal in verbier dont lose the light and fire in your eyes
6232104 youth orchestras generally astound audiences with their technical virtuosity and they bring to it all the primal freshness of discovering great music
6232105 this is what i dont understand people are telling us that classical music is old hat and the world has moved on and yet the youth orchestras are all there theyve never had such a high level of attainment as they have in the last few years and yet theyre told its all over which leads one to ask is that really true i dont think so at all the passion for music is inextinguishable
6232106 the urge to make recorded music is a redundant and creative dead end
6232107 may well cast the biggest shadow over my career it never crossed our minds that it would be bigger than the records we made
6232108 came as a bit of a shock our accountant couldnt write it off as an artistic statement we had to pay 330 000 extra which was unexpected even though money was still rolling in from our royalties from around the world

6232114 one character is going to take her own life one is going to kill someone and one is to be killed
6232115 is that television because it goes into peoples drawing rooms should be raising important subjects and i think the bbc are probably a bit scared of this and they shouldnt be because we should be doing this in the old days when tv first started everybody was talking about the issues it raised
6232116 television programmes were a way of bringing other peoples lives into our notice and if this film makes people talk or makes people angry or anguished i think thats good i really do

6232123 i am certain there will be an awful lot of girls going to mt isa
6232124 its because we own up to everything we do were very honest about how we market ourselves were probably the only band at the moment that is totally unashamed of being screamed at
6232125 i wasnt expecting the blanket ban i think its unfair because its the first ban of its kind in a long time and i think that if i were not george michael then i would have no problem being played on those stations and its incredibly irritating having a record out for a couple of weeks and knowing that people havent heard it
6232126 there is no such thing as a reluctant star stars are almost always people that want to make up for their own weaknesses by being loved by the public and im no exception to that
6232127 i feel a very great need to be away from george michael for most of the time
6232128 i will never say if im gay i have never thought about my sexuality being right or wrong to me it has always been a case of finding the right person
6232129 i may be screwed up but im not a flasher i responded to a good looking american cop i fell for the trick when he started playing this game i think its called ill show you mine you show me yours and then when you show me yours im gonna nick you
6232130 i have no problem with people knowing i am in a relationship with a man right now i have not been in a relationship with a woman for almost 10 years i want people to know that i have not been exposed as a gay man in any way that i feel any shame for i feel stupid and reckless and weak for having allowed my sexuality to be exposed this way but i dont feel any shame whatsoever and neither do i think i should
6232131 i have put myself in an extremely stupid position i can only apologise i can try to fathom out why i did it but ultimately part of me has to believe that some of the kick was the fact i might get found
6232132 i dont consider americans bullies but i do consider the american government bullying our government needs to reassure our islamic population that we are not going into the middle east with a gung ho attitude blindly following america
6232133 i really dont need the publics money id like to have something on the internet with charitable donation optional where anyone can download my music for free
6232134 this stuff keeps me sane and happy id say its a great drug but obviously its not very healthy you cant afford to smoke it if youve got anything else to do it can be a terrible terrible drug youve got to be in the right position to take it youve got to have achieved most of your ambitions because it chills you out to such a degree that you could lose your ambitions but in terms of relaxation and coming up with a good idea or two a spliff helps
6232135 i was one of those people who dealt very badly with fame the first time it was offered to me which i suppose was 88 the faith tour so my memories of touring are distorted by that i think i also didnt handle bereavement very well in the nineties my partner died and then my mother died and i wasnt very good at recovering when theres no one to kick you up the arse and tell you to get back to work it the recovery process can go on for too long so i gradually started thinking that i should tour
6232136 its quite easy to fall asleep at hyde park lights
6232137 ive been sentenced on the basis of unfit driving through tiredness and prescription medications which i fully accept responsibility for im glad to put this behind me and now im off to do the biggest show of my life
6232138 i truly believed that tonight would never happen that i would never sing these songs to you again but then im a fool which youve probably worked out by now
6232139 i was supposed to be a real thatcherite just by dint of being a first generation immigrant and having not had money and then suddenly having it and getting on planes and going to ibiza and sitting around in thongs but actually nothing i was writing or doing was even vaguely thatcherite
6232140 because of my brushes with the press and the law and also some of the bereavements ive gone through that were made public i have been forced into revealing a lot more of myself than i ever had before therefore when i step out on stage people are seeing a much more rounded individual theyre seeing someone with strengths and weaknesses and its made a huge difference in terms of the warmth in the shows its absolutely incredible
6232141 being able to hit rocks and them falling open and there being a beautiful ammonite i cant believe anybodys not going to get excited about that
6232142 i really love ducks theyve always got a smile on their face
6232143 give a cow a cuddle its the new cure for stress
6232144 a mans left testicle always hangs lower than his right
6232145 she saw his name on a list of people to be hanged under a clock in the next few days cripes
6232146 we were led to believe that granny butter had some immensely distinguished alsatian antecedents

6232157 at the rate im going with minimum payments i will be in debt for the next 12 years
6232158 my no 1 advice to families is to fill out the fafsa
6232159 many students and parents dont realize that federal loans are available regardless of income and they are a good deal especially in this volatile environment
6232160 different states have different aid programs that serve people in different ways
6232161 also most financial aid offices have the capacity to adjust if theres been a significant change in circumstance
6232162 it was basically a free ride to a school that probably i wouldnt have been able to afford if there were no scholarship
6232163 three years ago people thought of google as just a search engine
6232164 but that image has broadened to include e mail news maps and images
6232165 people are using social networks blogs and discussion forums to interact
6232166 businesses are getting to know their customers better by monitoring industry forums and blogs opening better avenues for complaints and feedback and even making facebook and myspace pages to push information about their business out on the web
6232167 a really big five no even bigger then that right there in the corner and make it purple
6232168 naked in the boardroom a ceo bares her secrets so you can transform your career
6232169 what pleased me the most was seeing the talent of ray brown jr hold up so well with all these brilliant and different sounding artists as a result of his versatility and the unique arrangements of the songs we were able to capture a wide variety of flavors which i think offers something for everyone on this album
6232170 is vocally ready to take her place beside other international r amp b songbirds
6232171 jamtse love and compassion an offering to the tibet fund
6232172 is yoga really all that effective in helping one to lose weight
6232173 we are talking about people who were offered a mortgage a few months ago when the lenders were offering 95 per cent mortages but are unable to do so now that deposits of 15 per cent are required
6232174 in 1980 600 000 mortgages with homeowners were held by local authorities
6232175 since then the banking industry has almost universally taken on this role
6232176 the government should recognise that local authorities are well placed to judiciously take a share of mortgage business
6232177 it would be good news for customers if it got off the ground but it would not be done in a couple of months
6232178 weve done it through good old fashioned class room teaching and discipline school uniform has to be perfect students and staff have to respect each other and there is no shouting
6232179 it isnt a magic trick we work at it and if a product isnt good enough we cancel it
6232180 theyre essentially design geniuses making games easy enough for casual players and deep enough to attract and hook hard core players
6232181 simple to learn difficult to master is the holy grail of game design
6232182 this is going to be a rain event and its moving very slowly
6232183 what we really need to be worried about is flooding
6232184 any water that breaches the banks is going to be important
6232185 people who live along these banks are the ones that know that best
6232186 its one of those classic things where a person whos unfamiliar with taking care of a child becomes frustrated when a child wont stop crying and through his frustration he did anything he could to get the child to stop
6232187 in this case was possibly dropping the child to the floor and twisting the childs legs

6232189 one way of boosting recycling might be to offer top recyclers smaller bins to demonstrate they have reduced their waste it gives people an aspiration to throw less away
6232190 it can make people slightly obsessive about turning things off
6232191 all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
6232192 precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
6232193 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark
6232194 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43bn
6232195 easily reach 50bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the treasury
6232196 these dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control one test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
6232197 gordon brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence
6232198 you do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90 of the work done in parliament on political issues

6232200 claiming they are open 24 hours when they are not
6232201 jezza is legend and deserves a chance to run the country
6232202 while the british public is having to tighten its belts the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project
6232203 we cannot make assumptions about involvement in terrorism based on the colour of someones skin their ethnic heritage or their nationality
6232204 you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6232205 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6232206 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is no difficulty with that at all
6232207 we are trying to give whatever help we can including talks on reconstruction
6232208 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights
6232209 arsenal have won precisely nothing since then not even a carling bloody cup
6232210 it should be on record that i said nothing at that meeting absolutely nothing
6232211 all tory mps have been instructed to have no further dealings with the organisation accordingly
6232212 this damaging confusion in the midst of an international crisis with one minister saying one thing and another saying the opposite must be immediately cleared up
6232213 what i disagree with is the dangerous behaviour of david cameron in tbilisi when he said georgia should immediately join nato to punish the russians
6232214 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming why not cycling
6232215 how many of us as parents would let our kids ride on the public roads in britain children need safety and skills and if cycling was on the curriculum as a key life skill so that every kid in britain rides a bike that would be a massive boost to the sport of cycling
6232216 that moment when a parent first pushes their kid off on their bike without stabilisers is a memorable one and weve all done it ride a bike to burn more calories and eat a bit less and youll solve child obesity issues but you have to find the right facility and make it fun for kids
6232217 over the last 11 years since this generation of students started at school there has been a transformation in the funding and support for schools and in the attainment that flows from that
6232218 we still have what i term the stubborn 20 who arent reaching the standards we expect in literacy and numeracy by the age of 11
6232219 that figure was nearly twice as large 10 years ago so we have narrowed that proportion significantly but to my mind our biggest challenge over the next few years is to see that all primary school children as early as possible within their primary school years get up to standard in the basics of literacy and numeracy
6232220 there is room for debate on the precise form the tests take but i believe it would be a seriously retrograde step to abandon national tests
6232221 i think also i would herald as a key objective the elimination of underperforming secondary schools
6232222 the key objective of improvement must be to get primary school children up to competence in the basics but it is not acceptable that parents should be faced without a choice of a good quality secondary school in their locality
6232223 essentially they are filler courses before pupils can go on to genuine vocational education
6232224 too many people are being cheated in this government stunt pupils employers the public and all to make the government look like its doing better than it is
6232225 we had a lot of supply teachers coming in so i didnt think the lessons were very good really
6232226 we had all the technology whiteboards projectors and stuff like that but they dont actually help you with maths we had literacy and numeracy hour at primary school so we did basic comprehension maths algebra they separated the groups according to ability i know of the gifted and talented scheme there were special maths lessons in the holidays and visits to oxford and cambridge universities i have an older brother whos now 20 and we both agreed our experience of primary school was better than secondary he also went to st columbus and he had better teachers ones i call old school because they knew how to control the class it all comes down to the teachers
6232227 o bien la m xima ignorancia de los mecanismos m s elementales del estado de derecho que no es presumible en quienes sostienen a un gobierno democr tico o bien la confusi n absoluta entre los partidos y los rganos de gobiernos por ellos gestionados
6232228 constantes referencias a la jurisprudencia europea y constitucional a una eventual ley singular y a la eventual afectaci n de minor as
6232229 puede ser encarnado por los partidos pol ticos en atenci n a las cualidades de las que se encuentran investidos
6232230 un instrumento capital del pluralismo no son rganos del estado
6232231 no genera situaci n alguna de indefensi n en la defensa de los intereses de los ciudadanos que afirman representar
6232232 los partidos pol ticos no son representantes pol ticos de los ciudadanos
6232233 la representaci n pol tica recae sobre las concretas personas incluidas en las candidaturas que tras las correspondientes operaciones electorales resultan elegidas

6232242 what i disagree with is the dangerous behaviour of david cameron in tbilisi when he said georgia should immediately join nato to punish the russians
6232243 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6232244 some of the history of plympton has gone up in flames
6232245 fire and police are working together to find the cause of the fire
6232246 she was the head of a wonderful and interesting family who taught the middle classes to reassess their lives and how they viewed the so called working class she was brilliant
6232247 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6232248 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6232249 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6232250 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6232251 can only be positive for map but it doesnt wipe out the questions from before or the concerns of some allies none of that has gone away
6232252 this position will have gone down very well in tbilisi but do we really mean to commit ourselves to all out war against the russian federation if something like this happens again
6232253 if western hawks really are advocating nato membership for every small country that borders the russian federation even a government more charitably disposed towards nato than the present russian one is going to see the move as a direct challenge
6232254 they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make decisions on the basis of their own popular will
6232255 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming why not cycling

6232258 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6232259 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life

6232264 gordon brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence
6232265 with this adaptation we wanted to stay faithful to the spirit and period of the book but asked the writer lizzie mickery to feel free to reimagine it for a modern audience more familiar with james bond and jason bourne
6232266 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now

6232271 it is striking how unqualified obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6232272 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and
6232273 limbaugh obama won primaries because no one had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6232274 striking how unqualified mccain is and how this whole thing came about within the republicanic party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a former pow who has spent the last eight years kissing the a of george bush whose very own campaign in 2000 engaged its smear machine on mccain
6232275 folks im desperate ill sell you a hummer for 19 95

6232277 we cannot make assumptions about involvement in terrorism based on the colour of someones skin their ethnic heritage or their nationality
6232278 i often thought that if i could have given up and done something else i would have done
6232279 retrospectively i can see that i was learning all the time but it was often difficult i was employed sometimes and i had things in development but there were a lot of disappointments it was not so much stubbornness or even belief i just carried on writing to deal with disappointment i had to write for the sake of writing not some imaginary reward
6232280 the richard amp judy booker venn diagram crossover no i dont think theyve ever done that
6232281 he raised his hand again quickly and she flinched and hated herself for flinching but he didnt hit her he smiled at her and they both knew this was the beginning
6232282 its about our fear of young men our fear of outsiders
6232283 were doing it at the moment with young men too anybody standing at a corner wearing the wrong sort of hood is a devil as if the rest of society isnt imploding around us anyway
6232284 it was always a compulsion to write to tell stories but it just never occurred to me that i might be a novelist that seemed a much scarier thing to do
6232285 my sister said to me youd be so good at writing something really funny about women and i thought oh god thats the sort of book i wouldnt want to read and who wants to write that
6232286 all the life of it was still there so i just felt as if it hadnt been told it wasnt done all of lewiss early life was unfolding i didnt know where to put it all it wasnt another film and really to keep myself sane i thought ill put it down as a book but i still wasnt thinking i was going to write a novel just thinking ive just got to tell this
6232287 its such an emotional story love and grief and all these giant feelings i was always trying to find that balance where it wouldnt tip over into overstating a thing but where it wouldnt be so cool as not to tell it
6232288 in my mad head it was sort of a novelisation film scripts are like the tops of little mountain peaks or the tips of icebergs then having the rest of the iceberg there and being liberated to write that iceberg it was like being let off the lead it was wonderful
6232289 wont that be fun ill be thinking do we need to have this and that bits rubbish were not going for that i think i have to liberate myself from whats there itll be hard to do
6232290 it will do my head in its too precarious im not happy with it i might never show it im in one of those states
6232291 yeah lets save the world who cares if my child falls off ill be a hero to the world
6232292 palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6232293 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent and much appreciated care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6232294 provide further momentum in our efforts to deliver improvements in palliative and end of life care services

6232299 obesity is a manifestation of a cultural depravation in its most vulgar and displeasing to look at form and its suicide as a lifestyle
6232300 it all comes back to the horror the soullessness of a trend in america that is the abandonment of parenting somebodys got to go you cant eat that youre way too fat
6232301 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6232302 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment
6232303 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6232304 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher
6232305 this is especially true of cancers involving the but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6232306 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6232307 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6232308 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6232309 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6232310 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6232311 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients

6232324 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6232325 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6232326 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6232327 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia

6232331 i dont think running for office is anything im prepared for or could even prepare myself for
6232332 there is nothing i can even compare it to in my own life i work really long hours and work a lot and have done press tours and junkets but there is nothing like a presidential campaign that i have experienced before i think at one point we visited three different cities in one state in 12 hours its exhausting
6232333 most of the college students showed up to get a picture and an autograph
6232334 but if in the process they did hear my argument or did hear something that resonated with them i dont think its because i am on
6232335 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
6232336 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and alright were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest
6232337 but obviously we all had a deep yearning inside to get back to do this or it wouldnt have happened i just hope we dont split up again now cause it becomes a bit silly doesnt it
6232338 its gonna be towards the end of this year or the beginning of the new one
6232339 we did six dates earlier this year and it wasnt enough i want to visit all those places weve been where we know weve got fans and breathe life into these new songs from forth thats definitely on our list of things to do
6232340 it puts television not on an even footing with the internet but it could leapfrog it
6232341 the idea of writing an application once and having it play on all environments is incredible
6232342 i watched both and still had no fricking clue what was going on i know its an important film but at least try to explain some things
6232343 they are one of the heaviest bands to date and their lyrics are amazing
6232344 the coach called me and the captain aaron mokoena into a meeting in london where he outlined his vision to the 2010 world cup he stated very clearly that because of our football profiles and experience he expects us to lead the campaign forward
6232345 it was a positive meeting and frank coach santana asked whether i can commit to availability throughout the 2010 african cup of nations qualifiers and to all games that i am called up to honour
6232346 i told the coach that i will be available because i love my country and i always show that in every game i play just like last night
6232347 we have a bright future and the way we played against a good team like australia showed that we have talent and direction
6232348 what we need now is the enthusiasm of the people of south africa the remaining qualifiers are important and are going to be tough and we therefore need the support of all south africans
6232349 i met the two players and had a man to men talk with them about my expectations of them and the leadership expected from players of their football status
6232350 im therefore happy with the commitment they have made to the countrys vision of a world class team for 2010 and to their responsibilities to south africa
6232351 in the same way that george w bush went to war in iraq without thinking through the consequences now john mccain wants a new war with no end
6232352 john mccains handlers are using the same strategy they used for their old boss george w bush
6232353 john mccain adopts the bush policy of drilling and doing the oil industrys bidding
6232354 john mccain wants to out george bush george bush and give away the federal treasury to the super rich
6232355 like george bush john mccain doesnt think that there is any problem and is happy to go back to his lavish estate
6232356 john mccain wants to appoint judges just like george w bush did who trample on the rights of workers the environment etc etc
6232357 si era arrivati i viaggiatori alzarono gli occhi e davanti a loro cerano le alte vette larco aper le porte alla citt del tibet un urlo era schizzato dal cuore non si era arrivati solo alla meta desiderata e sudata si incontrato laltro nella presenza in unintimit fatta d sogni paure quotidianit di speranze e ricerca ed anche questo ci che stavamo cercando forse gli altri siamo noi e le differenze di colore di esperienze di zaino sono solo la buccia che ricopre la mela il suo succo i pensieri pi profondi li si conosce solo vivendo e ascoltando ascoltando suoni parole silenzi e musica dellanima semplici come i bambini con le ali e il cuore aperto possiamo e dobbiamo vivere il nostro volo nella libert baster ascoltare il vento e muovere le ali
6232358 they had already warmed up to keira knightley and joe wright with pride and prejudice
6232359 have you seen a film directed by so and so
6232360 everyone loves a free ticket and in return we ask people to fill in an online feedback form
6232361 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
6232362 for the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name
6232363 to him that overcomes will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
6232364 so etwas habe ich in meinem leben noch nie gesehen
6232365 if its the usual masturbation with a living partner i try not to have it at all
6232366 maybe we are all just masturbating with a living partner
6232367 actually theyre shit at this age babies come back to me in about four months when it can do something other than crap itself
6232368 now that ive got used to the baltimore accents im loving it
6232369 i put a lot of thought into this because youre my esteemed friends
6232370 its not about being taught fixed positions postures in which to hold the body and it isnt manipulation like say physiotherapy or massage
6232371 the goal of at is to set up the right circumstances under which the body can function as it was meant to
6232372 youre learning the tools you need to use your body more effectively and efficiently and getting to know your patterns and habits so you can let go of the bad ones the hands on element is important because it helps you feel how a movement can be different thats difficult to do from a book
6232373 definitely by the time people walk through the door they are usually willing to change something
6232374 theyve been through the my backs not working can you fix it mindset and tried a lot of other things so by the time they come to me they are more open to change
6232375 with physiotherapy you can receive some treatment and be shown all the exercises you need to do in say six sessions
6232376 we dont diagnose and we dont treat our role comes after treatment and any good teacher will ideally work one to one in conjunction with the clients medical practitioner
6232377 pilates is brilliant for backs because it works the spine through all its planes of movement
6232378 extension flexion rotation and side flexion as well as teaching good body awareness and use improving breathing and posture
6232379 chiropractic is wrongly pereceived to be simply a manipulative technique thats just like saying dentists only do fillings
6232380 its actually a complete package of care which could involve everything from hands on treatment to postural assessment and stretching
6232381 symptoms are the last thing to come and the first thing to go so we tend to blame the problem on the last action we did rather than looking at the bigger picture
6232382 when a patient walks in yes i want to alleviate their pain but i also want to look at its cause and the aggravating factors because without addressing these the problem will return
6232383 the role of the osteopath is to help the individual manage themselves in ways that will optimise their recovery
6232384 treatment will likely involve a combination of hands on treatment movement re education and exercises to practise at home as well as the development of coping strategies
6232385 frozen food displays appallingly because the freezer section is usually at the back of a store and because you just dont look at boxes covered in frost and go yum yum
6232386 all of those factors are involved but the leading factor is price
6232387 if you think about iceland in particular it has a very strong discount image a lot of their stores were located near to kwiksave shops and when that chain closed last year iceland picked up a lot of business the new perceptions are that frozen food is great value and theres no waste
6232388 the average waitrose shopper wouldnt be seen dead in iceland
6232389 when you go to the marks amp spencer simply food at the station on your way home from work youre likely to buy a chilled ready meal
6232390 jean christophe has spent many days and nights in newcastle at the findus factory
6232391 ensuring every single product meets his high expectations at every stage of the recipe development each dish is freshly prepared on site then fast frozen in a process that takes just 2 hours by comparison domestic freezers can take as long as 12 hours to complete the process and produce much larger ice crystals that affect the quality of the food when thawed and reheated
6232392 hand moulded and carefully placed in the tray the fish is then positioned on top to protect the spinach this is then covered with a sauce that uses fresh double cream and sprinkled with emmental and cheddar cheese fresh of course
6232393 this isnt just frozen spinach this is hand moulded frozen spinach
6232394 firms such as birds eye have done a great deal to remove the view that frozen food is filled with preservatives and to argue for the view that its better to have frozen than nominally fresh food that has taken a long while to get to you
6232395 frozen veg is so handy and healthy too because freezing locks in all the goodness with this youre never stuck for a bit on the side
6232396 weve added about 700 000 extra households into the brand
6232397 people who were buying infrequently are consuming it more and buying on a regular basis people who were potentially rejecting it are now reappraising and trialling
6232398 but i suspect that the issue of the strength of the trend depends on how long we continue with the credit crunch at this stage no one really knows how long that will be
6232399 were endlessly familiar with the problem she is confronting being looked at as black women through a different lens from our white counterparts who are portrayed as kinder gentler souls who somehow deserve to be loved and valued more than we do
6232400 we need an advocate in the white house now more than ever before
6232401 theres as much likelihood of that happening as there being commercial space flights
6232402 he is going to leicester for a week to check things out its not yet finalised when he will be leaving but it could be by saturday
6232403 whenever he trains there is still swelling so i am worried about that
6232404 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed
6232405 why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
6232406 seventy four applications have been withdrawn so far because the problems those applicants contended for were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6232407 two other applications have been suspended because their procedures were incomplete in one of such cases for example the applicant applied to take children to the demonstration which is against chinas law and the one remaining application has been vetoed by the public security authority as it is in violation of chinas law on demonstrations and protests
6232408 his past is his past you know he was a better competitor on the blocks
6232409 theres no bitterness at all it is the way it is and thats life
6232410 the reason i felt he might not get it here was that he wouldnt have been working on speed endurance the ability to hold that speed for the entire race
6232411 but he showed that he had been working on that and was able to bring home 19 30
6232412 i looked at colin jackson and i said wow it was much more of an amazing start than he got in the 100m and his turn was just absolutely fabulous he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in here focused on it knowing most likely hed win the gold
6232413 were aware that there is a bit of history but hes asked for an opportunity and the fact that its a one year deal is important here
6232414 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind i cant explain how i feel i just proved to the world that i am a true champion and that with hard work anything is possible
6232415 i aint no superman 2 i am the lightning bolt
6232416 people were shocked when michael johnson did what he did in atlanta people will be more shocked by what usain bolt has done in these championships he is a good guy and it can only help the sport
6232417 i know he is clean we know where he lives his coach is always there we know what he does we know what he eats
6232418 when i was in athens four years ago i always thought i would be at the next olympics
6232419 i want to be there in 2012 and if im there i want to be there with my sister when you go to an olympics you catch the bug
6232420 one of my brothers was crying which was really weird hes 25
6232421 hopefully i will be able to view it as the olympics and not some random meet literally i wont have to go anywhere
6232422 realistically its something i have to put up with whether i like it or not
6232423 its not something i let get to me too much because my job as an athlete is to keep on performing and thats what i am going to do
6232424 i am not expecting people to forget but its important that i keep doing what i like doing working honestly thats what i believe in it doesnt bother me too much any more
6232425 she was very calm in the warm up area everyone was playing with their hands and tapping their feet standing up and sitting down i said good luck to one of the jamaicans but that was it she sanya was very calm for me it was bordering on extreme confidence and thats a worry when the rest of us were wetting ourselves
6232426 the funny thing is i dont know what was going through my head but i wasnt panicking
6232427 i like to pride myself on the fact that i like working under pressure thats what i get kicks out of i like being told you cant do something and then going out and doing it i never felt at any point in the race that i was quite a way down which is quite worrying actually because i was i didnt see that i would have panicked sanya panicked and thats why she tensed up the worst thing you can do in any race is tense up
6232428 tuvimos un desempleo en el segundo trimestre medio punto menor que el del segundo trimestre del a o pasado baj del 8 5 al ocho por ciento
6232429 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6232430 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6232431 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6232432 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs
6232433 we are very excited to have aaron taking over as president of this company

6232437 a once weekly drug that lowers glucose substantially induces weight loss isnt associated with hypoglycemia and lacks a cardiovascular safety signal has multibillion dollar potential
6232438 setiap pagi dan sore saya mendengar ada teriakan simpati emtri eksel cepe teriakan ini bukan hanya satu kali tetapi beberapa kali dan dilakukan beberapa orang rupanya mereka ini penjaja pulsa yang berkeliling menelusuri lorong lorong lp di blok hunian seperti halnya pedagang sate keliling menawarkan satenya di sekitar kawasan hunian
6232439 dia bilang kamu mau kemana ke tempat siapa saya bilang ke jakarta dan tujuan saya kuliah tapi enggak tahu mau ke mana
6232440 ya usaha saya juga enggak akan berhasil tanpa bantuan dari orang lain termasuk kakak kakak dari fe itu
6232441 sebelum kenaikan bbm omzet sehari bisa mencapai rp 3 500 000 rp 4 000 000 saat ini omzet anjlok hingga rp 3 000 000 per hari
6232442 jika harga terlalu mahal justru membuat dagangan tidak laku karena mayoritas pembeli di sini adalah pedagang eceran
6232443 sebelum bbm naik saya masih bisa mengikuti arisan saat ini yang penting ada modal uang yang datang dari hasil penjualan kue cuma lewat begitu saja tidak ada yang nyangkut enggak ada yang bisa disimpan
6232444 jangan berharap dapat untung dapat rp 1 000 000 saja sudah senang
6232445 perlu perlindungan masa depan usaha mereka ini kalau ganti gubernur ganti kebijakan pedagang kue subuh ini terancam keberadaannya saat ini mereka dilindungi tetapi bagaimana ke depannya bisa bisa pedagang ini tergusur dari tempat berjualan yang ada saat ini
6232446 track record saya secara kualitas maupun kapabilitas jauh lebih bagus daripada adjie massaid saya memang bukan selebritis seperti dia tapi semua orang juga bisa mencatat bagaimana kemampuan saya sebagai akademisi politisi pengalaman sebagai menteri dan lain lain
6232447 saya ini orang dari tuban jadi saya kira rakyat di tuban dan bojonegoro lebih ngerti urusan saya secara substantif ketimbang para selebrtisi mungkin selebritis tiap hari dilihat sebagai selebritis tetapi sebagai wakil rakyat pasti rakyat tuban dan bojonegoro lebih tahu yang terbaik karena yang saya adu bukan soal kekayaan atau selebritinya tetapi track record saya semua orang sudah tahu
6232448 karena pimpinan partai yang menentukan yah saya sebagai anggota partai oke oke saja dulu di pkb saya ditempatkan di jabar yah nggak masalah
6232449 saya tertarik dengan hanura karena meski partai baru tapi mempunyai prospek yang mungkin lebih bagus dari partai yang lain
6232450 sudah biasa saya pakai sepeda motor ke mana mana saya harus sering pergi untuk sekadar belanja pewarna atau memenuhi jadwal belajar teknik membatik untuk itu saya bisa ke solo yogyakarta atau semarang kadang kecapekan tetapi setelah melihat hasil batik yang saya buat semua rasa lelah hilang
6232451 data yang didapat dari berbagai cerita menunjukkan motif kapal kandas diilhami dari kandasnya kapal china di kawasan ini mungkin lebih dari 200 tahun lalu kapal bangsa china tersebut kandas dan penumpangnya yang selamat kemudian bermukim di lembah gunung muria atau kudus batik kudus sama seperti batik di daerah pesisir lainnya amat dipengaruhi budaya china
6232452 belakangan ini batik sedang tren sehingga langkah untuk memperkenalkan batik kudus terasa lebih mudah namun suatu saat tren fashion pasti akan berubah supaya tidak kandas lagi saya harus memperkuat batik kudus dengan penggalian sejarah dan pengayaan motif motifnya ini yang selalu menjadi pekerjaan rumah saya
6232453 they allow the debits to go through instead of rejecting them
6232454 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6232455 i am not getting back on the plane with all the press there
6232456 and im not going to london you cant make me i have done my time i am a free man
6232457 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6232458 you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6232459 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6232460 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is no difficulty with that at all
6232461 we are trying to give whatever help we can including talks on reconstruction
6232462 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights
6232463 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6232464 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6232465 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6232466 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6232467 can only be positive for map but it doesnt wipe out the questions from before or the concerns of some allies none of that has gone away
6232468 this position will have gone down very well in tbilisi but do we really mean to commit ourselves to all out war against the russian federation if something like this happens again
6232469 if western hawks really are advocating nato membership for every small country that borders the russian federation even a government more charitably disposed towards nato than the present russian one is going to see the move as a direct challenge
6232470 they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make decisions on the basis of their own popular will
6232471 all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew the governments policy was actually causing harm
6232472 precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
6232473 he got an incredible start i just went wow it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100m and his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6232474 he has incredible speed and an incredibly long stride that affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can
6232475 my house has been taken over by more than 100 people from inside and outside the community
6232476 they are waving flags beating drums and just making a lot of noise but this is a special moment and to know that a jamaican has done this and i am the father of that jamaican makes me feel special i never expected him to break the world record but i am proud of my son
6232477 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
6232478 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6232479 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life
6232480 over the last 11 years since this generation of students started at school there has been a transformation in the funding and support for schools and in the attainment that flows from that
6232481 we still have what i term the stubborn 20 who arent reaching the standards we expect in literacy and numeracy by the age of 11
6232482 that figure was nearly twice as large 10 years ago so we have narrowed that proportion significantly but to my mind our biggest challenge over the next few years is to see that all primary school children as early as possible within their primary school years get up to standard in the basics of literacy and numeracy
6232483 there is room for debate on the precise form the tests take but i believe it would be a seriously retrograde step to abandon national tests
6232484 i think also i would herald as a key objective the elimination of underperforming secondary schools
6232485 the key objective of improvement must be to get primary school children up to competence in the basics but it is not acceptable that parents should be faced without a choice of a good quality secondary school in their locality
6232486 essentially they are filler courses before pupils can go on to genuine vocational education
6232487 too many people are being cheated in this government stunt pupils employers the public and all to make the government look like its doing better than it is
6232488 we had a lot of supply teachers coming in so i didnt think the lessons were very good really
6232489 we had all the technology whiteboards projectors and stuff like that but they dont actually help you with maths we had literacy and numeracy hour at primary school so we did basic comprehension maths algebra they separated the groups according to ability i know of the gifted and talented scheme there were special maths lessons in the holidays and visits to oxford and cambridge universities i have an older brother whos now 20 and we both agreed our experience of primary school was better than secondary he also went to st columbus and he had better teachers ones i call old school because they knew how to control the class it all comes down to the teachers
6232490 obama has apparently lost some support but we are still in a lock
6232491 weve essentially been in a holding pattern since the nominations were wrapped up
6232492 the ministry is ensuring the safety of muslims by hiring more staff for night shifts imams and workers will be present every day
6232493 young people are sympathising as they see themselves and todays situation in the novel
6232494 the taliban caught us by surprise in an ambush that was extremely well prepared our men were not in a position to respond and fell in the first minutes
6232495 because it was here that the fight for terrorism is being fought
6232496 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
6232497 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6232498 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
6232499 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
6232500 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
6232501 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do
6232502 if the spirit is at peace though the body contend there is no violence but if the spirit is not at peace though the body be at rest there is always violence
6232503 i am a republican a black dyed in the wool republican and i never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress
6232504 it isnt that liberals are ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so
6232505 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
6232506 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
6232507 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
6232508 the only truly consistent man is he who will for the sake of being right today contradict what he said wrong yesterday
6232509 im having a lot of anxiety and that worries me
6232510 man is not disappointed by that which happens rather he is disappointed by his perception of that which happens
6232511 if no one is mad at you you probably havent said anything of importance
6232512 sooner or later we all have to choose between what is right and what is easy
6232513 it is not a mistake to have strong views the mistake is to have nothing else
6232514 when people agree with me i always feel that i must be wrong
6232515 share the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
6232516 the early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese
6232517 while we are free to do whatever we wish we are not free to have the consequences be whatever we want them to be
6232518 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
6232519 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
6232520 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
6232521 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
6232522 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously
6232523 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
6232524 fanatacism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim
6232525 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6232526 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life
6232527 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6232528 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6232529 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6232530 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6232531 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6232532 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6232533 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6232534 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6232535 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6232536 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6232537 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6232538 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6232539 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6232540 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6232541 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

6232567 in australian politics you have to appear competent but not over confident
6232568 one of john howards strategies was always to suggest that the election was going to be close
6232569 one of the phenomena of australian politics is that if you have an opportunity to claim underdog status you claim it even if the basis is a little bit flimsy

6232571 it was great really great to come back although it was less great when we were 2 0 down

6232575 we have to find a way to manage what he does out there thursday night
6232576 the biggest thing is hit him is to hit ricky ray

6232581 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two pre season games
6232582 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6232583 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6232584 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6232585 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6232586 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon

6232588 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces

6232742 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
6232743 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6232744 we do know of several bugs that were working on for release in a month or two i would imagine these will fix your issues dont worry this will get resolved soon
6232745 imagine being buried deep in sand and wanting to move but cannot
6232746 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6232747 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6232748 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go back to zero
6232749 i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6232750 all the americans are doing is paying them just to be quiet
6232751 justify paying monthly salaries to people on the grounds that they are ex insurgents
6232752 if they only take a portion of them its possible they will return to their insurgent ways
6232753 you cant get rid of a program by shoveling it on the iraqi government shoulders
6232754 the last time we humiliated thousands of these guys is back in 2003 and we got the insurgency
6232755 we wish we were part of the army with deep remorse the government is sectarian
6232756 the sons of iraq achieved security dont they deserve to enter the army
6232757 showered his mistress with large sums of money and expensive gifts

6232763 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming why not cycling
6232764 how many of us as parents would let our kids ride on the public roads in britain children need safety and skills and if cycling was on the curriculum as a key life skill so that every kid in britain rides a bike that would be a massive boost to the sport of cycling
6232765 that moment when a parent first pushes their kid off on their bike without stabilisers is a memorable one and weve all done it ride a bike to burn more calories and eat a bit less and youll solve child obesity issues but you have to find the right facility and make it fun for kids
6232766 we welcome the overall rise in people entering higher education however the incremental increase in the number of poorer students accepting university places is not good enough
6232767 institutions must not be complacent when it comes to widening participation among those groups who have not traditionally attended university
6232768 they must also be careful to give a fair chance to those who have gained qualifications other than a levels but who may nonetheless benefit from higher education
6232769 i am particularly encouraged by the increase in acceptances from lower socioeconomic groups as we continue to work to widen participation in higher education through for example greater links between universities and schools and the aimhigher programme
6232770 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming on the core school curriculum why not cycling
6232771 how many of us as parents would let our kids ride on the public roads in britain children need safety and skills and if cycling was on the curriculum as a key life skill so that every kid in britain rides a bike that would be a massive boost to the sport of cycling
6232772 that moment when a parent first pushes their kid off on their bike without stabilisers is a memorable one and weve all done it its an accessible sport and weve all done it you can do it with the family it doesnt cost that much to do its straightforward ride a bike to burn more calories and eat a little bit less and youll solve child obesity issues but you have to find the right facility and make it fun for kids
6232773 facilities are something that at an elite level we dont have a problem with theyre not a limiting factor but they are needed for family cycling kids going out with their parents closed road circuits for grass roots racing
6232774 i have only one request in terms of a legacy from all this that they keep that bmx track i only got planning until august 29 and im supposed to knock it down and pay for the dirt to be carried away i cant do that so sir howard bernstein the chief exec of manchester needs to keep it for us thats shanazes track all the local kids can put down their knives and guns in that corner of manchester and come and ride their bikes maybe if we did a bit more of that they wouldnt go back to their guns and knives
6232775 they had already warmed up to keira knightley and joe wright with pride and prejudice
6232776 have you seen a film directed by so and so
6232777 everyone loves a free ticket and in return we ask people to fill in an online feedback form
6232778 over the last 11 years since this generation of students started at school there has been a transformation in the funding and support for schools and in the attainment that flows from that
6232779 we still have what i term the stubborn 20 who arent reaching the standards we expect in literacy and numeracy by the age of 11
6232780 that figure was nearly twice as large 10 years ago so we have narrowed that proportion significantly but to my mind our biggest challenge over the next few years is to see that all primary school children as early as possible within their primary school years get up to standard in the basics of literacy and numeracy
6232781 there is room for debate on the precise form the tests take but i believe it would be a seriously retrograde step to abandon national tests
6232782 i think also i would herald as a key objective the elimination of underperforming secondary schools
6232783 the key objective of improvement must be to get primary school children up to competence in the basics but it is not acceptable that parents should be faced without a choice of a good quality secondary school in their locality
6232784 essentially they are filler courses before pupils can go on to genuine vocational education
6232785 too many people are being cheated in this government stunt pupils employers the public and all to make the government look like its doing better than it is
6232786 we had a lot of supply teachers coming in so i didnt think the lessons were very good really
6232787 we had all the technology whiteboards projectors and stuff like that but they dont actually help you with maths we had literacy and numeracy hour at primary school so we did basic comprehension maths algebra they separated the groups according to ability i know of the gifted and talented scheme there were special maths lessons in the holidays and visits to oxford and cambridge universities i have an older brother whos now 20 and we both agreed our experience of primary school was better than secondary he also went to st columbus and he had better teachers ones i call old school because they knew how to control the class it all comes down to the teachers
6232788 in my life id had just one puff of a cigarette when i was 10 and spent all of the following day throwing up
6232789 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6232790 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life
6232791 with this adaptation we wanted to stay faithful to the spirit and period of the book but asked the writer lizzie mickery to feel free to reimagine it for a modern audience more familiar with james bond and jason bourne
6232792 speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
6232793 stephen gately of boyzone used to cover up the fact that he missed high notes by grabbing his trousers at the right moment which sent the crowd into a screaming frenzy
6232794 a band like coldplay have perfected the technique of writing songs that say something without actually saying anything
6232795 that way every member of the crowd thinks the songs are about them
6232796 doubling the rhythm of the hi hat kick and snare drums has the effect of sending your heart rate soaring
6232797 your bodys rhythm is almost physically connected to the tempo of the drums
6232798 adopting a defensive position and trying to withstand as much pain as they physically can
6232799 you park up your car for four days arent at home to use any of your electrical equipment are living in a tent and using communal facilities
6232800 its harder to collect sort and recycle rubbish in the wet things get dirty its more difficult and some people just cant be bothered
6232801 ive never seen a cleaner festival than latitude but it already has that thoughtful air to it at reading and leeds the audience profile is younger its is not that they dont care but if doing something good means walking to the recycling point and missing the best band of the night they wont do it
6232802 we make sure all our cups at reading and leeds are paper and theres a 10p deposit on them to encourage people to return them
6232803 we have three or four different types of bin and well station a green messenger at every rubbish point literally directing peoples hands to the right bin otherwise it just becomes a pile of rubbish
6232804 there isnt a huge amount of consumer pressure for them either it is mainly driven by ourselves but the plus factor is that other festivals are following the lead
6232805 as much as three quarters of an events carbon footprint is created by people travelling to the festival
6232806 most organisers are doing as much as they can but its the audience who are going to make the difference
6232807 you might recall that hed sic raised the issue of free data
6232808 is a big supporter of os so i dont think this a parliamentary question is anything to worry about
6232809 learning mandarin is even harder than winning eight gold medals
6232810 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6232811 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month
6232812 the movie is set for release next year and its going to be a huge movie lionsgate recently announced that theyre putting a hundred million dollars into it
6232813 we have a very close relationship with the guys making the movie
6232814 i had lunch with the producer just the other day were talking to them all the time
6232815 arsenal have won precisely nothing since then not even a carling bloody cup
6232816 it should be on record that i said nothing at that meeting absolutely nothing
6232817 all tory mps have been instructed to have no further dealings with the organisation accordingly
6232818 we run the risk that our military presence will gradually turn the afghan population entirely against us
6232819 most operas are dirtier than amy winehouses beehive riper than a full on effing rant by gordon ramsay and more violent than a tarantino bloodfest
6232820 art cant change your life it is not a diet programme or the latest guru it offers no quick fixes what art can do is prompt in us authentic desire it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 hour emergency zone called real life
6232821 here are the alpha males shoulders bowed from the weight of eternity
6232822 the struggle itself is enough to fill a mans heart one must imagine sisyphus happy
6232823 hello andrea how has it been in ireland so far
6232824 we have always known that this part of the world is very rich in prehistoric remains
6232825 but the sheer number of new finds exposed by the fire is the most exciting development in archaeology in my experience
6232826 one of the very rare features exposed by the removal of the entire plant and soil covering is a set of defined borders to the areas cultivated in the bronze age
6232827 but it gave us access to a landscape which we could never have reached otherwise on such a scale no archaeologist has the means to dig out an area like this what we have found as a result has altered perceptions of the period it also raises questions about the scale of what else lies hidden over the rest of the north york moors
6232828 weve brought things almost up to date by making detailed surveys of slit trenches and foxholes used for training on fylingdales in the second world war and since forgotten
6232829 and the most recent finds are shell craters left over from artillery practice which carried on into the 1950s
6232830 everyone had to work very rapidly because the protective cover had vanished
6232831 opened up a whole new chapter in our understanding of the moor
6232832 were endlessly familiar with the problem she is confronting being looked at as black women through a different lens from our white counterparts who are portrayed as kinder gentler souls who somehow deserve to be loved and valued more than we do
6232833 we need an advocate in the white house now more than ever before
6232834 people dont realize when were not working together we hang out together we go on vacations together
6232835 i just moved just got an apartment in beverly hills im so excited
6232836 were growing up and we all have such huge dreams we want to fulfill but i would be on board to do a fourth movie definitely
6232837 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
6232838 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying
6232839 you make a movie with some people you become friends over the process of making this movie and then you go your own way
6232840 even by disney channel standards this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun
6232841 i do think there is some relief that comes with the filing of the report it allows us to bring closure to what is a sad and embarassing situation for the university
6232842 when theyre out on the road themselves and doing this sort of thing theyre trying to recruit the best they can sometimes you lose sight of whats important i think theyre two great guys who made some serious mistakes
6232843 all institutions are cautioned that due diligence must be exercised prior to accepting courses from fresno pacific for academic credit and athletic eligibility purposes
6232844 we are extremely disappointed and frustrated that the committee on infractions refused to look at all the evidence in a fair and equitable way
6232845 what they do is take your statement by ambush the enforcement staff shows up on your door will not give you the opportunity to look at any documents look at any phone records they try to almost force you into a lie and then they can come back and charge you with unethical conduct after they put you in that position
6232846 it does reduce the number of potential licensees and may put further pressure on arms licensing revenue
6232847 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark
6232848 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43bn
6232849 easily reach 50bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the treasury
6232850 these dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control one test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
6232851 gordon brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence
6232852 manufacturers are becoming more downbeat about forthcoming levels of activity but are still having to raise their prices due to the severity of recent cost increases domestic conditions remain sluggish and the recent slowdown in the eurozone economies is starting to make conditions tougher for uk manufacturing exporters although the weaker pound will offer some relief
6232853 would be that an unexpected rate rise might adversely affect business and consumer confidence adding to the near term downside pressures on activity and causing a material undershoot of the inflation target in the medium term although rates could be cut later in that event the downturn would be unnecessarily deep adding to the volatility in the economy
6232854 the main risk associated with an immediate cut was that it could cause wage and price setters to conclude that the committee was more concerned about sustaining output growth than about returning inflation to its target
6232855 given the current stance of monetary policy and the prospective weakness in the economy the resulting increase in spare capacity should bear down on inflation that would help to counter the risk of high inflation in the near term becoming embedded in inflation expectations and to bring inflation back to the target there would however still be significant risks to the inflation outlook
6232856 when youre travelling you already do your shopping before you come here there are too many shops
6232857 that the government is interfering with baa seems ridiculous when they were the ones who offered it the licence to operate gatwick and other uk airports in the first place
6232858 could only be a good thing they baa have embraced some of the worst things about pseudo state ownership
6232859 given its superior exploration and appraisal opportunity set we believe tullow should outperform should the oil price rebound and the markets appetite for exploration exposure return also further exploration success could make tullow a merger and acquisition target next year such is the size and quality of the ghanaian discoveries with potential for additional upside from uganda
6232860 uk gas prices have posted significant gains on news that a pipeline from the kvitebj rn gas field in norway which we estimate comprises 5 of 2008 forecast norwegian gas output was shut down after a leak was discovered this is bullish for dana petroleum tullow and venture production and highlights the jittery nature of the markets to any sign of indigenous supply disruptions
6232861 this years dividend looks secure but what about next bts cash flows continue to come under pressure from lower margins and higher capital expenditure
6232862 sainsburys food trading is the weakest of the big four and we can foresee this worsening as the downtrading theme continues and the fillip from marks amp spencers poor performance dissipates
6232863 the multiple would imply a fair value of 960p for dignity
6232864 that said we think it unlikely that dignity would be a bid target currently having come out of private equity ownership in 2004 and with already high levels of financial leverage
6232865 the underwriters have until august 22 to place the balance of the shares while the overhang presents a near term investment risk b amp b now emerges as a well capitalised bank
6232866 frozen food displays appallingly because the freezer section is usually at the back of a store and because you just dont look at boxes covered in frost and go yum yum
6232867 all of those factors are involved but the leading factor is price
6232868 if you think about iceland in particular it has a very strong discount image a lot of their stores were located near to kwiksave shops and when that chain closed last year iceland picked up a lot of business the new perceptions are that frozen food is great value and theres no waste
6232869 the average waitrose shopper wouldnt be seen dead in iceland
6232870 when you go to the marks amp spencer simply food at the station on your way home from work youre likely to buy a chilled ready meal
6232871 jean christophe has spent many days and nights in newcastle at the findus factory
6232872 ensuring every single product meets his high expectations at every stage of the recipe development each dish is freshly prepared on site then fast frozen in a process that takes just 2 hours by comparison domestic freezers can take as long as 12 hours to complete the process and produce much larger ice crystals that affect the quality of the food when thawed and reheated
6232873 hand moulded and carefully placed in the tray the fish is then positioned on top to protect the spinach this is then covered with a sauce that uses fresh double cream and sprinkled with emmental and cheddar cheese fresh of course
6232874 this isnt just frozen spinach this is hand moulded frozen spinach
6232875 firms such as birds eye have done a great deal to remove the view that frozen food is filled with preservatives and to argue for the view that its better to have frozen than nominally fresh food that has taken a long while to get to you
6232876 frozen veg is so handy and healthy too because freezing locks in all the goodness with this youre never stuck for a bit on the side
6232877 weve added about 700 000 extra households into the brand
6232878 people who were buying infrequently are consuming it more and buying on a regular basis people who were potentially rejecting it are now reappraising and trialling
6232879 but i suspect that the issue of the strength of the trend depends on how long we continue with the credit crunch at this stage no one really knows how long that will be
6232880 we are open to evaluating the deal but we will wait to see if the terms are attractive
6232881 on the one hand there are plenty of funds out there with money to invest in airports however on the other hand airport valuations have fallen reflecting tighter credit conditions and a more uncertain aviation environment and its never good to be a forced seller we would also expect the uncertainty of changes toughening to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value
6232882 meaningful valuations will be tricky to achieve in the current market though the infrastructure sector has been holding good value
6232883 unravelling the airports from baa so that they are in a position to be sold will also be a mammoth task requiring careful handling
6232884 there will be enormous structural difficulties involving technology property data people contractors service providers pensions etc in separation managing these whilst continuing to operate the airports will not be straightforward
6232885 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6232886 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6232887 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6232888 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6232889 neither fat nor flesh nec pinguitudo nec caro but something in between
6232890 somebody with an interest in snails went along to a lecture and described them to mollusc expert janet ridout sharpe who quickly identified them as
6232891 we believe it is the first time the snail has been found in the uk and that they arrived attached to the marble all those years ago
6232892 it is astonishing and almost embarrassing that they have remained undiscovered until now our excuse is that we didnt take the property over until 1942 and so from our point of view we failed to spot them for only 56 years
6232893 we are always stumbling across new species on our sites and though technically an invasive species the snail is not brutish in any way and is welcome to stay
6232894 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and integrity
6232895 i prefer not to call it a sense of fairness but others might
6232896 mccains comments were not only political poison in colorado they displayed a disturbing ignorance of the realities of the wests scarce water resources to say westerners are disappointed in mccain would be an understatement
6232897 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6232898 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6232899 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6232900 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs

6232902 these breakaway republics remaining georgias parts is out of the question
6232903 if the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia want it and if duma will take the corresponding decision
6232904 these breakaway republics remaining georgias parts is out of the question
6232905 all in all the status of the breakaway republics will be changed soon
6232906 russias recognition of the breakaway republics will provide for establishing bilateral relations with abkhazia and south ossetia concluding treaties on military cooperation without taking account of third party countries and develop economic contacts basing on the legitimate law
6232907 the company reported record revenues and made significant progress with its proprietary technology development during the quarter
6232908 zaio was pleased to announce the successful implementation of this technology in july as initial zones were brought to
6232909 readers are cautioned that the total remaining costs to bring a substantial number of the sold zones to live status over the next 12 months
6232910 accordingly there is uncertainty regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern

6232938 the uses for ribbon are endless and with 29 available colors and unlimited patterns from cream city ribbon its easy to be both style savvy and eco conscious
6232939 of course any award or ranking like our inclusion in the inc 5000 is a tremendous accomplishment for actronix
6232940 however making the inc 5000 marks a particularly momentous occasion as five short years ago actronix was cash poor and faced with potential failure the fact that weve been able to rejuvenate this once struggling company to be included in the inc magazines list of the 5000 fastest growing privately held companies is a source of extreme pride for all 300 members of the actronix team
6232941 we are extremely pleased to have placed so high on the list

6232970 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6232971 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6232972 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on

6232983 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6232984 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6232985 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law

6232989 im trying to compete and get better every day competition pushes us all and you cant look too far ahead if you do you might not be here
6232990 we think its a matter of time before it gets there
6232991 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6232992 we believe that tevas expertise and knowledge in successfully conducting large pivotal clinical trials and in developing markets for large unmet medical needs will prove invaluable in maximizing multikines potential
6232993 this agreement is consistent with our strategy to share the clinical and regulatory expenses associated with the development of multikine while retaining rights to market multikine in north america and europe
6232994 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6232995 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
6232996 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
6232997 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
6232998 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the amount spent on research and development
6232999 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine
6233000 it costs on average 550m and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
6233001 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price
6233002 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6233003 its ridiculous to think that a physician is going to be influenced by a cheap pen and a coffee mug
6233004 but there was a perception that somehow these interactions were influencing prescribing decisions in the final analysis the perception became the reality and we just decided it wasnt worth the fight any longer
6233005 for some staff it may mean altering their lunchtime routine on some days so im sure they will miss it
6233006 but will that impact patient care i dont think so because our physicians prescribe based on what they believe will be of the greatest benefit to patients not on who provides the best goodies to their staff
6233007 this kind of advertising is crucial to sales a doctor is not going to prescribe something he or she has never heard of and its the drug representatives job to get the products names in front of the physicians
6233008 when i was a new physician 25 years ago i remember some of the doctors talking about getting new tvs all kinds of stuff
6233009 when i became a doctor i went on a couple of trips scottsdale stuff like that i dont think those had any lasting influence but i quit going out to dinner with those guys a long time ago i just didnt want to be encumbered
6233010 as an industry we do some things to cause people to scratch their heads
6233011 but by and large this is an industry that dedicates itself to inventing new medicines that allow people to live longer healthier more productive lives thats how we want people to see us
6233012 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6233013 what this forecast points to is a significant weakening of business and consumer confidence granted the risk of a true recession may be something of a self fulfilling prophecy but spiraling costs and cashflow issues are of very real concern to businesses in wales
6233014 from conversations with members of ngb2b it is apparent that money is tight and cost control is an issue and these difficulties are compounded by debtors that are failing to settle invoices on time
6233015 although domestic trade seems to be taking a significant hit there has been a noteworthy increase in the export activity of local businesses particularly to china and india
6233016 certain industries will undoubtedly feel the ill effects of the current economic climate more than others but if we as a country continue to invest in entrepreneurship and strengthen synergies between the academic and business worlds i am confident that wales can counteract a downturn

6233021 arsenal is known for playing technical and skillful football and has a young but experienced squad
6233022 im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6233023 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and caliber will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honors this season
6233024 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6233025 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
6233026 not leaving until we call this congress back into session and vote for energy independence
6233027 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
6233028 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
6233029 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
6233030 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
6233031 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor

6233044 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6233045 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6233046 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6233047 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6233048 i just wanted to say thank you for serving our country
6233049 i know you share with me a deep love for america and an awesome pride in those who defend her when i meet with our troops they always inspire me with their sense of duty and honor they are americas finest citizens

6233055 das ist alibi du hast null chance so an den ball zu kommen
6233056 du stehst da drau en willst du da erdbeeren pfl cken
6233057 es ist kein beinbruch ein spiel zu verlieren rgerlich halt dass es das erste der saison war ich hoffe dass die spieler damit kritisch umgehen
6233058 ich bin hier um titel zu holen wir haben die qualit t f r mehrere titel
6233059 ja wir haben dort was gutzumachen es wird garantiert sehr schwer f r claudio pizarro
6233060 die ganze truppe steht total kompakt kevin kuranyi ist schon unser erster verteidiger wenn wir auch samstag so gegen den ball arbeiten steht die null weiter
6233061 wir wollen drei punkte und uns selbstbewusstsein f r das r ckspiel in madrid holen
6233062 das war der kr nende abschluss unserer seuche nach einem sieg bei werder wirds ihm gleich wieder besser gehen
6233063 mein zuhause das braucht auch mal ein paar sch nheitskorrekturen
6233064 es ist gelb es ist h sslich es passt zu nichts aber es kann leben retten
6233065 es stimmt aber ich m chte noch nicht viel sagen es ist noch alles sehr frisch
6233066 das hat f r das marketing gro e auswirkungen denn adidas verkauft acht von zehn trikots mit namen und r ckennummer
6233067 als partner der fifa nehmen wir die neuregelung zur kenntnis und werden im gemeinsamen dialog mit unseren nationalmannschaften den sachverhalt diskutieren

6233070 wir arbeiten super gerne zusammen aber leider klappt das so selten
6233071 normalerweise bekomme ich um diese jahreszeit sommersprossen aber heuer fehlanzeige weil ich nur noch am schreibtisch sitze
6233072 bei der em hatte ich fast nur offensive leute dabei das hei t aber nicht dass die jungs nicht verteidigen konnten auch ein kevin keegan oder kalle rummenigge mussten nach hinten ackern beim hsv werden auch alle defensiv arbeit leisten m ssen so ist der fu ball nun mal
6233073 ein spieler weniger mehr nicht nat rlich war van der vaart ein richtig guter aber piotr trochowski hat die gleichen qualit ten er braucht vertrauen muss auch mal schlechter spielen d rfen van der vaart war auch nicht jede partie berragend
6233074 aber genau das ist seine position ich hatte ihn als dfb trainer gemeinsam mit bastian schweinsteiger drei jahre lang unter meinen fittichen ich sage dass er das kann
6233075 der kann einiges seine standard situationen sind brandgef hrlich er hat einen echten tor riecher doch er muss auch bereit sein noch dazu zu lernen
6233076 ich glaube der tausch zwischen petric und zidan war das beste was der hsv machen konnte auch wenn der klub noch draufzahlen musste mohamed zidan passte eben nicht nach hamburg
6233077 wenn die mannschaft das niveau vom 2 2 bei bayern m nchen h lt und dann noch cleverer spielt kann es diese saison bis in die champions league gehen aber der uefa cup sollte am ende immer drin sein
6233078 da haben wir ein sehr engagiertes gutes heimspiel abgeliefert wenn uns das am freitag wieder gelingt w re ich sehr zufrieden
6233079 von der disziplin und vom kopf her wird da eine ganz andere elf auf dem platz stehen

6233095 ich w re gl cklich f r celtic zu spielen ein klub mit viel tradition und gutem ruf in europa
6233096 mir f llt der vorzeitige r ckzug nicht leicht denn die aufgabe hat mir sehr viel freude gemacht ich kann mir vorstellen dass in meinen r ckzug viel hineininterpretiert wird aber ich sage ganz klar es ist vor allem eine pers nliche entscheidung und ich bin berzeugt dass dieser schritt das beste f r den konzern und auch f r mich ist
6233097 wir haben sehr viel geschafft bei evonik der konzern steht heute exzellent da und ist fit f r die zukunft
6233098 ich geh re nicht zu den menschen die sich f r unverzichtbar halten lassen sie es mich so ausdr cken ich klebe nicht an meinem stuhl habe kein pattex am hintern

6233121 theyre about love and letting go of things and trying to overcome your own weird craziness and pain dealing with feeling guilty and how guilt twists up all intense and strange in you like weird earthy roots in the ground and its about forgiveness in yourself and others too and its also about trips weve taken and good and bad places weve been and some songs are a little bit about boxing and a little bit about the devil knocking on your window outside he looks a lot scarier than he is good hangs

6233132 she stated that she really misspoke and stated that what she wanted to say was that she wanted them to be children who like to play with legos and who like to play in the dirt
6233133 she stated that she did not ask the childrens race and she stated that it had been a really stressful day and she misspoke she stated that she regrets saying what she said and that she never meant it to be taken that way because her own grandson is hispanic
6233134 the principal acknowledges that her actions were wrong and highly inappropriate she regrets her actions and is very remorseful

6233148 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6233149 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6233150 hes been coming to edinburgh for four years and this year its perfectly structured and very tightly written
6233151 you dont get a lot of male female double acts and they really do know how to play off each other
6233152 there is a new generation of young women comics really stepping forward
6233153 weve written off the americans they couldnt hold a candle to the welshman
6233154 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6233155 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6233156 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6233157 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6233158 he came here camouflaged as the guy from slipknot we know the wrong kind of music and drugs have bad effects young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music
6233159 whenever there is a murder people jump to conclusions and always god or satan told the killers to do it these notions shouldnt be taken seriously because it is straightforward someone of their own free will can kill another person
6233160 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive
6233161 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
6233162 subject matter and themes rarely touched upon in videogames making it a genuinely mature game for a new world of adult gamers
6233163 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6233164 fire dancing circuses and 3 000 person light saber war
6233165 for the first time ever we will genuinely see these celebrities eat sleep and shower in the most disgusting prisons in the world
6233166 it was just ego to say youve never been on the dl
6233167 that would have been nice but this is something we need to take care of
6233168 this will allow me to step back and get a better idea of why my pitches were lukewarm and belt high which get hit 10 ouf of 10 times at this level
6233169 settle has everything i admire in a great band poetry tunefulness originality and vision all pursued recklessly as if the whole thing might fall apart at any second and you can dance to it
6233170 colt probably runs 4 5 hes so much faster than perceived and one of the problems is he followed vince young who was faster than anybody chasing him its just one of those deals we never knew how fast vince was but nobody caught him he was fast in uniform and colts the same way
6233171 in the end its a situation that there isnt any one answer to you can look at all the factors
6233172 i think overall weve been in six big 12 championships and won five of them we are doing something right we know how to win those games and well manage these others the best we can and i think as much as anything its the players staying invested and us as coaches as well doing the job we need to do to be at our best in those situations
6233173 i think the biggest issue is your speed on the field on defense and athleticism guys that can play in space tackle in space cover pressure do those kinds of things
6233174 hes been coming to edinburgh for four years and this year its perfectly structured and very tightly written
6233175 you dont get a lot of male female double acts and they really do know how to play off each other
6233176 there is a new generation of young women comics really stepping forward
6233177 weve written off the americans they couldnt hold a candle to the welshman
6233178 its not about being taught fixed positions postures in which to hold the body and it isnt manipulation like say physiotherapy or massage
6233179 the goal of at is to set up the right circumstances under which the body can function as it was meant to
6233180 youre learning the tools you need to use your body more effectively and efficiently and getting to know your patterns and habits so you can let go of the bad ones the hands on element is important because it helps you feel how a movement can be different thats difficult to do from a book
6233181 definitely by the time people walk through the door they are usually willing to change something
6233182 theyve been through the my backs not working can you fix it mindset and tried a lot of other things so by the time they come to me they are more open to change
6233183 with physiotherapy you can receive some treatment and be shown all the exercises you need to do in say six sessions
6233184 we dont diagnose and we dont treat our role comes after treatment and any good teacher will ideally work one to one in conjunction with the clients medical practitioner
6233185 pilates is brilliant for backs because it works the spine through all its planes of movement
6233186 extension flexion rotation and side flexion as well as teaching good body awareness and use improving breathing and posture
6233187 chiropractic is wrongly pereceived to be simply a manipulative technique thats just like saying dentists only do fillings
6233188 its actually a complete package of care which could involve everything from hands on treatment to postural assessment and stretching
6233189 symptoms are the last thing to come and the first thing to go so we tend to blame the problem on the last action we did rather than looking at the bigger picture
6233190 when a patient walks in yes i want to alleviate their pain but i also want to look at its cause and the aggravating factors because without addressing these the problem will return
6233191 the role of the osteopath is to help the individual manage themselves in ways that will optimise their recovery
6233192 treatment will likely involve a combination of hands on treatment movement re education and exercises to practise at home as well as the development of coping strategies
6233193 its a lucky thing for local broadcasters that the olympics are only 16 days
6233194 outside we stink we couldnt beat anybody outside right now
6233195 we get bodies out there who can play but its an open tryout
6233196 anybody who wants to get outside and make big plays in our offense which isnt very difficult theyll be our guy
6233197 this is the first time weve got juniors who are the go to guys at camp things have gone all right they havent gone as well as wed like
6233198 learning the offense in a short period of time is almost impossible were trying to get better every day
6233199 what we are going to do is have tom get his knee cleaned up a little bit more preventative than anything else
6233200 it hasnt healed the way we would have liked hopefully its nothing serious and can alleviate some of the swelling and the pain and hopefully he is ready to go by the first game

6233204 pimstein was able to convince a couple people there to use their computers to control the bank accounts that he laundered the money through
6233205 it was about making money and then it turned into pimstein being the center of attention
6233206 him being important to these people that were friends he played baseball with them he knows their kids in some cases
6233207 i cant believe somebody would go to so much trouble to try to take advantage of you
6233208 one time we met just me pimstein and weber at the university of miami conference room
6233209 it was specifics about what the interest rate was going to be they wanted me to be on the board of directors of this company
6233210 some dipped into their 401 k for the quick turn around
6233211 he or she got points got a percentage off the top of all their investors so they would solicit more investors
6233212 a classic ponzi scheme a fraudulent investment operation that involves paying earlier investors from the principal of later investors rather than from profits generated from real business
6233213 i dont believe you needed the money to do this so why why did you do this
6233214 in reality pimstein and the bottom line had no business relationship with ripley
6233215 he does not seek a public airing of his loss but does not want his business or reputation damaged by association

6233217 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6233218 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
6233219 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done
6233220 its obviously senseless but the fact of the matter is that virtually all these cases are senseless
6233221 it used to be youd arrive at a crime scene and youd find five or six shell casings
6233222 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6233223 for the first time latinos and immigrants in general can have a bigger role in selecting the next president of the united states

6233228 me sent muy bien pero platicando con luis fosatti kinesi logo dijo que hay que ir poco a poco sin apresurarnos es normal que haya sentido desconfianza pero l me comenta que vamos a llevarlo tranquilo y esperemos estar contra santos
6233229 desde la semana anterior ya quer a estar con el equipo s existe esa ansia ser a muy apresurado decir si voy a estar al cien por ciento el s bado pero estamos trabajando para eso y si no viene la sudamericana y espero jugar en los dos
6233230 el precio internacional de los energ ticos est n bajando y el de la gasolina en m xico aumenta entonces los dos precios se van a encontrar m s r pidamente de lo previsto hace unas semanas
6233231 estamos hablando ya de tasas de inflaci n pr cticamente de 5 5 por ciento o m s en la canasta b sica en otros productos los incrementos de precios han sido mucho mayores y est n repercutiendo tambi n sobre los m rgenes de utilidad de las empresas

6233233 m s que absorber los incrementos del diesel son costos que nos est n llegando directo a las empresas es el mismo caso del gas aunque afortunadamente el mercado ya se vio un poco m s equilibrado

6233247 kami harap polisi melakukan penyidikan ulang kasus pembunuhan asrori dengan adanya pengakuan ryan bahkan perlu juga uji dna terhadap keluarga korban dan mr x yang ditemukan di belakang rumah ryan
6233248 dia itu kan punya sifat kewanitaan jadi kena benturan fisik sedikit saja sudah tidak tahan dan merasa kesakitan
6233249 sejak adik saya masuk penjara ibu sakit sakitan dan puncaknya jumat lalu beliau terkena stroke
6233250 sedangkan mukanya tidak dapat dikenali karena sudah rusak posisi mayat saat ditemukan memang tertelungkup sehingga kemungkinan bagian muka sudah dimakan belatung lebih dulu
6233251 tapi ini hanya pendapat pribadi saja untuk tindak lanjut kasus ini saya menyerahkan sepenuhnya kepada proses hukum
6233252 ryan mengaku membunuh aldo sehabis lebaran ryan bilang aldo kan sudah dikabarkan mati jadi saya bunuh saja dia sekalian
6233253 itu dilakukan mereka demi ryan mereka khawatir kalau identitas mr x diungkap keamanan ryan terancam karena akan membongkar salah tangkap pada kasus asrori yang itu jelas menampar penegak hukum
6233254 sepeda motor itu adalah milik ryan ini diketahui dari penelusuran stnk dan bpkb yang ada di samsat
6233255 dia ryan diperiksa karena namanya tercantum sebagai pemilik sepeda motor itu
6233256 kepada siapa dia ryan mengaku seperti itu sampai saat ini dia tidak bilang seperti itu kepada penyidik
6233257 saya tidak boleh bicara kapan matinya dibunuh menggunakan apa atau bagaimana cara kematian korban
6233258 i gained nothing at all from supreme enlightenment and for that very reason it is called supreme enlightenment
6233259 oh wait where did i put that stupid key fob thingy no not this one this is for my bank i need the one for the online auction its blue i know it
6233260 we need help in the bullpen and thats what hell be
6233261 im not at liberty to tell you if itll be in the fifth inning sixth inning seventh inning setup guy closer short guy this and that hes a bullpen guy so well leave it at that
6233262 im still trying to figure out how to control my emotions right now just got done with my first pitchers fielding practice session so it feels like i got a little bit of the nerves out of the way but ive still got them
6233263 we kind of thought hed be here by september if he progressed accordingly
6233264 i think both of our pitching coaches at double a and triple a did a real nice job with him and hes a guy that were glad to have im going to use him
6233265 he was very good against right handed hitters hes got movement arm angle is a little different obviously his size i think factors into it he has late life on his pitches obviously hes very excited not too many guys from montana get to come to the big leagues and hes here for the first time and were glad to have him
6233266 the first six years have been a good base for my career being able to learn about myself and pitchers
6233267 as long as youre physically healthy and strong hitters get better with age no doubt
6233268 i learned so much from chipper jones in the year i was with him us both being switch hitters and very selective hitters
6233269 our lockers were next to each other and we talked every day
6233270 he had the most unbelievable three months ive ever seen
6233271 hes one of the most focused players on the field ive ever seen i was very lucky to play with him for a year
6233272 ive gotten better every year early in my career i was more of a free swinger and my walks to strikeouts were a bit of a concern
6233273 after the 2005 season my third season with the rangers teams started getting more careful with the way they pitched me i started taking more pitches and walking more
6233274 some pitchers are going to come after you and if youre too selective you can find yourself in bad counts after you face a guy three or four times you get a feel for his approach
6233275 moving back and forth between leagues my book on pitchers has gotten a lot bigger
6233276 obama has made afghanistan a centerpiece of his proposed strategy for dealing with terrorism threats the illinois senator has said the war in afghanistan where taliban and al qaida linked militants are resurgent deserves more troops and more attention as opposed to the conflict in iraq
6233277 the bush administration which during the last fortnight has begun to shift towards obamas positions on iran and iraq announced that it was willing to negotiate with iraq a timetable for withdrawal though without mentioning any dates speaking instead about a vague general time horizon
6233278 i can give it to kids they can do wigs for them they can be happy
6233279 whenever she goes to town shes telling everybody about it
6233280 we played well at times we just couldnt get the ball in the back of the net
6233281 we played a lot better than them and thats why theyre maybe happy with a draw
6233282 we set our stall out with the shape to try to get something from the game to look forward to the world cup campaign
6233283 the performance and results for northern ireland for many years away from home havent been particularly good
6233284 this decision follows several weeks of discussions with fa chairman lord triesman on the role of the chief executive within the new fa structure
6233285 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future
6233286 we have achieved a lot over the past three and a half years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6233287 this season will see a number of initiatives introduced in the professional and grass roots game
6233288 its a long term plan and we are working with all members of the football family

6233292 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command and conquer
6233293 the calibre of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6233294 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cgi or animation techniques
6233295 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6233296 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6233297 what i realised is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool

6233305 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me
6233306 im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond
6233307 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie

6233312 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
6233313 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6233314 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6233315 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6233316 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6233317 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6233318 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6233319 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6233320 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie
6233321 now comes bo impersonating a warrior but the fact is that this incident is characteristic of bos mo usmc since when even though this isnt illegal or against military regs who in the world does this salty language description think he is you didnt earn it you dont wear it i dont care if already thinks hes the commander in chief this angers me sure ill let my wife wear mine but she has to sacrifice just as much as i do for my country
6233322 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6233323 you wake up and have some inflammation thats basically what it is
6233324 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6233325 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6233326 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6233327 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6233328 but the one thing we dont want to do is rush him back
6233329 positioned at the low end of the market dish networks business has deteriorated sharply
6233330 churn has spiked higher share of gross additions has fallen customer satisfaction scores have declined subscriber growth fell by 90 percent in the first quarter and then got worse going negative in the second quarter and satellite sector headwinds are mounting with the telcos increasingly positioned as competitors rather than distributors
6233331 if you start with the basic premise that every american family is going to have broadband like water and electricity and cable is increasingly the default broadband provider then the satellite operators face the stiff challenge of coexisting in cable households
6233332 i cant do it i have to support internet explorer
6233333 marketers will be able to pay to accelerate usage they find valuable to dial up and down actions that people take on applications as part of the social ads program for instance news feed uses an algorithm to communicate a users actions to the friends who would find it most interesting marketers will be able to pay for increased or enhanced distribution above and beyond what news feed already provides
6233334 but it doesnt look like that to your friends because they care about you
6233335 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6233336 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6233337 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6233338 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6233339 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6233340 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6233341 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6233342 fantasy is really where the strongest interest is and where the money is in sports online
6233343 when we say open we are looking to create open apis which will allow you to create your own fantasy products and games and youll be able to pull your own scoreboards over to myspace or facebook
6233344 do you look at what yahoo has been able to do and say its just not worth taking a chance
6233345 what differentiates us from other web 2 0 companies is that they are too niche oriented and are not going after the bulk of the marketplace
6233346 in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
6233347 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
6233348 that is all i have to report guys i have not another single thing i can tell you
6233349 i think its probably down between evan bayh and senator biden
6233350 and i know john mccain his seriousness his love of country hell select the person who is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6233351 if john mccain goes with his gut and picks joe lieberman itll be a gamechanger and in a positive way
6233352 itll send a message that he is the real centrist in this race
6233353 and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
6233354 nearly three in 10 voters 29 pointed to mccain as the candidate running a negative campaign compared to just 5 who said obama is running a negative campaign mccains 29 rating is the highest of any one candidate in the previous two presidential elections
6233355 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6233356 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6233357 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6233358 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6233359 this town has changed a lot and newspapers arent as popular as they were
6233360 and i hope that i can work with the city and make it better than ever
6233361 he gave up his ghost today and we will miss him forever were gonna raise our spirits up a little bit

6233365 we have one of the finest midfielders in the world in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and is like roy of the rovers a colossus but hes not a left midfielder he has to be in the centre we are killing gerrard
6233366 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6233367 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6233368 it has been a problem for the past four or five years and its something we need to address as quickly as possible
6233369 i dont know what it is and as a group we are trying to put our fingers on it
6233370 if we were experimenting a bit it would worry me less but that seems to be his team
6233371 i only thought set pieces would win us the game
6233372 that was one of the worst performances i have seen from an england team
6233373 the second half was diabolical some of the players are unrecognisable from those who play in the premier league i was full of optimism before the game but then i saw the teamsheet
6233374 we keep chopping and changing the manager but the performances dont change and we dont improve we change the manager but pick the same players we keep picking them and they are the best players but they come here and play for england and dont perform
6233375 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mika ls versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mika l has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6233376 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career
6233377 if youre 31 and fancy a bit of champions league its difficult for us to compete with that
6233378 mika l was a great servant and a wonderful professional we wish him all the best at his new club and thank him for his service
6233379 how good of a quarterback is he well how good is the guy making the players around him better i think graham is really good at that i think one of his strengths is that he really doesnt have any weaknesses
6233380 i think our defensive line got better and better as the year went on i think we steadily improved we got a little older and more experienced and improved
6233381 there is a reason the windshield is 10 times larger than the rearview mirror
6233382 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6233383 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6233384 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6233385 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6233386 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6233387 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6233388 the afghan people have long doubted such claims of foreigners especially of britain and america and their trust about crushing al qaeda and
6233389 the people have the right to think that there is something in the wind
6233390 no one believes stability and peace will be restored to afghanistan until the training and equipping sites of the taliban are closed
6233391 ive had it with these motherf cking snakes on this motherf king plane
6233392 this situation compels the dprk north korea to heighten vigilance against such unjust demands as the verification in line with the international standard recently claimed by the u s as regards the nuclear issue
6233393 the dprk will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it

6233397 i would be very much interested in looking to see if the city of chattanooga and perhaps the hamilton county government might as relates to this utility do the same thing weve done with the electric power board that is that we would look into whether it is feasible and justifiable for us to take ownership of the tennessee american water company
6233398 i actually got a call yesterday about this very issue and said is there anything you can do to help you know were gonna obviously run into this time after time after time unless we assert ownership of this

6233402 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6233403 adamantly agrees with the governors position that now is not the time to borrow additional monies in order to balance the state budget
6233404 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients

6233419 once we get the building buttoned up and sealed in the interior folks can come in
6233420 thats millwork people thats painters thats electricians thats all those things so all those other trades come into play
6233421 you get a roof on it you can put plasterers in there and dry wall finishers and electricians and hvac guys and people that do the finishes the carpet guys and all that
6233422 we hope that winter doesnt come too early because if it comes before we get sealed up it may slow things down which will cause double shift work and other things to catch up activity for later on
6233423 theyre talking two turns theyre talking potentially anywhere between 1 200 and 1 400 people at one time on site
6233424 thats huge for us very seldom do you ever see a job like that

6233437 took it that they re entered the room i told them they had to write up a report
6233438 why didnt you ask mr naylon how they got the 6 000
6233439 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6233440 the public finance figures do nothing to alter the broad concern that the government on a medium term view is suffering considerable fiscal slippage
6233441 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43 billion pounds possibly 50 or 60 billion even
6233442 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark set against the treasurys forecasts for growth next year of over 2 percent the numbers will bring a whole load of problems come the pre budget report in november and force them to revise up their borrowing further
6233443 public finances are in a very difficult situation and it looks like the government will not meet its target in 2008 it puts increasing pressure on the government and will make it harder for them to help the
6233444 the public finance figures are broadly in line with expectations but do nothing to alter the broad concern that the government on a medium term view is suffering considerable fiscal slippage economy the governments forecasts look increasingly optimistic
6233445 this is going from bad to worse essentially there is a slight surplus as there always is in july but the public sector net borrowing is already 19 1 billion pounds nearly double last year
6233446 so the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43 billion pounds possibly 50 or 60 billion even
6233447 and that is without the full effects of the economic slowdown which wont be coming through yet in these figures because of the normal lag
6233448 so you might expect next year to be even worse i think they have got a real problem
6233449 the public finances were better than expected but still worse than in the same month last year i e smaller surpluses as a result the cumulative 4 month psnb is more than 10 billion pounds up on last year which points to a significant overshoot of the budget forecast
6233450 i try to always stress the fact that im not trying to be the next miss elizabeth because there will never be another miss elizabeth and thats the way it should be but i do love the fact that were trying to honor her in that way and i hope that people understand theres no way any of us could take her place still i do want to honor her legacy and show there can be that kind of classy emotional sweet character in wrestling im really honored to be in that spot
6233451 about two months ago on naveens invitation i met him in a hotel where arun was also present they offered me contract money for killing davinder they wanted his entire family killed the lure of money was enough to make me party to the crime
6233452 on sunday i called up davinder and fixed a meeting with him when i went to meet him later in the day i saw his only son and was reminded of my father and elder brother who are now dead i remembered all that i had gone through after their demise i felt a tug in my heart and told davinder everything
6233453 im surprised that they kin have been nursing such ill will against me for all these 25 years obviously they must have been extremely unhappy with the compromise i worked out between my brother and his business partner who is related to arun kumar i was reminded of the incident on sunday while talking to rasheed
6233454 i have two daughters and a son my husband is my very life had anything happened to him the entire family would have been ruined i can only think of rasheed as a messenger of god our saviour
6233455 im happy that officer naveen pal singh acted swiftly and arrested the accused and also that davinders life was spared
6233456 natasha admired the womans self possession it was an excellent impersonation of aristocracy putting the revolting masses back in their place natasha who had done her own research found the act nearly pitch perfect for an act it was she was certain she wouldnt have put it past lillian to have arrived at breakfast dressed in jodhpurs cracking a whip against her highly polished boots despite the absence of a stables for forty miles or more instead lillian had opted for the simple wool sheath bedecked with a kings ransom in pearls at neck and wrist the uniform of the bored society matron but not natasha recognized quite the done thing for breakfast in a country manor house

6233461 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6233462 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6233463 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6233464 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6233465 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6233466 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it
6233467 he practiced tuesday and just felt like he couldnt get up and go full speed
6233468 other guys will have to step up for the time that hes out
6233469 when i did it i knew i did something but i thought i might just have jammed another finger
6233470 i ended up going through practice i didnt think it was this serious
6233471 i got pushed in the back and hit the quarterbacks back of his foot and my fingers kind of slid between them
6233472 i didnt think it was as bad as they said it was

6233484 in many countries there is governmental concern over self sustainability of liquid fuels as a result there is increasing worldwide interest in technology that will produce fuels that are more environmentally friendly and reduces the dependence on oil above all and most immediately we face the end of the cheap fossil fuel era and the memorandum of understanding with wits presents g4g with a unique opportunity to produce ultra clean liquid transportation fuel like diesel jet fuel and gasoline
6233485 we also welcome the opportunity to work with a team of scientists who are among the most accomplished in the world in this field this joint venture with wits is a strategic relationship for g4g and adds a great deal of value to shareholders

6233508 in 2007 israeli experts trained georgian commandos in georgia and there were plans to supply heavy weaponry electronic weapons tanks and other arms at a later date but the deal didnt work out
6233509 twenty soldiers in georgian uniform were detained near poti three of them were arabs
6233510 despite the fact that mr mikheil saakashvili has signed the six point plan and agreed to withdraw georgian forces to their permanent bases this condition has not been fulfilled
6233511 such actions seriously complicate the general situation and impede the withdrawal process
6233512 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
6233513 we waited for georgias agreement to carry out the swap for 24 hours and we received it not long ago
6233514 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances

6233519 this is the best pizza in sf it is a thick sourdough crust with lots of sauce and fresh toppings it is about 18 for a 2 topping large so it is pretty reasonable and it will fill you up you could eat there but it really is more of a delivery or to go place
6233520 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centred on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
6233521 in some cases we just arent able to reprocess everything we collect or there isnt enough of it to do so

6233530 consumers from thane navi mumbai and pune circles had already decided to pay additional cost for uninterrupted supply also the trading company was prepared to trade for the required power depending on daily requirement
6233531 msedcl has violated the merc order which after a public hearing had asked it to impose zero load shedding in these areas if the utility feels the tatas are not able to procure the requisite power they must make other arrangements instead of imposing power cuts on consumers
6233532 the daily requirement for pune is 200mw thane is 99mw and navi mumbai is 107mw whereas the power procured on wednesday was only 100mw in such a situation it is difficult to schedule our power availability
6233533 i prayed after the first loss and i was tired after three bouts but then i knew my opponent was equally tired
6233534 i had to protect on the right and then try to score from the same flank

6233539 this is certainly one of the most promising and revolutionary leads in the fight against climate change and the quest to satisfy energy needs
6233540 whether you are watching tv vacuuming the house or driving your electric car to visit friends and family you would be removing co2 from the atmosphere
6233541 you kill three birds with one stone the algae serves at once to filter out co2 at industrial sites to produce energy and for agriculture
6233542 to cover us fuel needs with biodiesel extracted from the most efficient terrestrial plant palm oil it would be necessary to use 48 percent of the countrys farmland
6233543 the united states could potentially replace all of its petrol based automobile fuel by farming microalgae on a surface corresponding to five percent of the countrys farmland
6233544 significant hurdles must be overcome before algae based biofuel can be produced cost effectively
6233545 under this pledge requirement recipients of u s funds are forced to censor even their privately funded speech regarding the most effective ways to engage high risk groups in hiv prevention in may 2006 judge victor marrero of the u s district court for the southern district of new york ruled that the requirement violates the first amendment rights of two plaintiff organizations alliance for open society international and pathfinder international by restricting their privately funded speech and forcing them to adopt the governments viewpoint todays ruling extends that injunction to the members of interaction the largest alliance of u s based humanitarian organizations and to the u s based members of global health council a preeminent public health membership group
6233546 a combination of qgc and sunshine will drive further upside from sunshines extensive and promising coal seam gas acreage which has certified 2p proved and probable reserves already totalling 469 pj
6233547 these additional reserves can add powerful momentum to qgcs strategy to develop own and operate state of the art cleaner gas fired power stations in australia
6233548 vigorous competition in the domestic market is vitally important to qgc and our strategy will ensure a reliable electricity supply while also being of significant benefit to the environment in a carbon constrained economy
6233549 furthermore wholly owned 2p reserves of the combined group totalling 2 401 pj on top of a dedicated drilling program to prove up additional reserves would also give an exciting boost to qgcs queensland curtis lng project with bg group
6233550 qgc can increase its financial returns by supplying additional csg to the gladstone based plant which will have potential capacity of three liquefied natural gas lng production trains totalling up to 12 million tonnes a year of lng
6233551 the combination brings together two like minded queensland companies with common goals and cultures
6233552 sunshine has established independently certified gas reserves at its 100 per cent owned lacerta csg project near roma and has extensive acreage with considerable exploration potential
6233553 sunshines shareholders will also have the ability to share in any upside in improved csg pricing and a multi train lng development through qgc equity qgc is a significantly larger company with greater market liquidity and prospects for growing shareholder value
6233554 when the government takes digitisation of television to over 55 cities in the next 12 15 months conditional access system will come into play customers will have to switch to digital television from our experience we can say that people will prefer dth over digital cable the idea therefore is to grab as many customers as soon
6233555 they are not co operating with the eow regarding investigation carried out by them in respect of 48 vehicles imported on tr
6233556 we do not find that police in other states do not cooperate with the maharashtra police we are surprised that there is no arrangement within the country for the cooperation of police between various states
6233557 the eow should continue with the investigations and should not shirk from responsibilities by getting the court to issue notice to the dri we expect better performance from the mumbai police
6233558 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored

6233563 very few businesses are getting to grips with this issue but there is a really strong argument for working out what your water footprint is what type of water you are using and where you are operating in regions under water stress
6233564 if firms are operating in areas where they are contributing to falling water shortages they are opening themselves up to reputational litigation and operational issues in that water shortages could result in them no longer being able to operate
6233565 were working with some companies such as m amp s and coca cola on addressing water issues but to a large extent businesses are asleep to the upcoming water issues
6233566 the government has been engaging constructively at eu level for more widespread application of reduced vat rates to energy saving and energy efficient products
6233567 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long lifecycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6233568 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
6233569 currently a lot of people cannot justify spending a huge amount on a product just because it lasts longer

6233600 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6233601 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we have
6233602 a lot of people cannot justify spending a huge amount on a product just because it lasts longer but if this recommendation is followed through it should encourage modern electronics manufacturers to produce more sturdy products as standard
6233603 miroslav djukics contract has been terminated as of today and we have appointed radomir antic as the national team coach for a two year period
6233604 antics contract will be renewed automatically if we qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa and we are very optimistic about our chances results are the only barometer and we were not happy with djukics results
6233605 we are completely convinced we will get our moneys worth with antic and are equally sure he will be able to bring the best out of the players

6233630 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6233631 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6233632 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6233633 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6233634 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point

6233640 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6233641 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way

6233680 in the third quarter we said in the first 3 or 4 minutes we had to pick it up defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6233681 anytime any one of us whoever gets it going were going to find him but a guy like that who can just score at will one of the best scorers in the world if he gets it going keep going to him
6233682 in the early second quarter we were going one on five
6233683 we wanted to play a team game where everyone was touching the ball you saw that in the second half
6233684 we all want the ball but we all have to believe were going to touch it to be able to pick up our teammates and thats what kobe and lebron have done

6233720 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
6233721 as a european nation georgians have continued to resist in peaceful ways and this peaceful resistance will continue and intensify
6233722 the only thing i can promise the russians is that we will not fall georgia will not fall and that civilian peaceful resistance will expand and we will eventually create conditions where they have no other options but to leave
6233723 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it

6233735 what the bill does is requires that if theyre going to have a pharmacy just to make sure the patients safety is protected
6233736 it requires that the prescriptions be checked by a pharmacist or a doctor before they are dispensed the patients will still be able to receive their free samples will still be able to receive prescriptions from a free clinic pharmacy and other such things they could allow doctors to dispense or try to get volunteer pharmacists if they are unable to afford to pay a pharmacist
6233737 senate bill 722 passed in march by the legislature required the board of pharmacy to set up rules for the free clinics

6233753 we may think we live in a hectic world but statistically our environment moves slowly apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world when an object moves quickly be it a football or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong

6233792 i was familiar with the medium and realised that very few law firms were running blogs so suggested to kevin calder the firms it partner that we create one fortunately kevin agreed
6233793 weve had a huge amount of pr since starting the blog both from online and traditional print media
6233794 the blog is also a great way of engaging with the public of generating discussion about interesting legal developments
6233795 weve got some work through the blog but its a slow burn process
6233796 i cant tell you of any new cases weve brought in directly as a result of the blog
6233797 but there have been intangible benefits were providing a service for our clients doing summaries of recent class action decisions and arbitrations they dont have to pay for it and they love that it enhances our reputation as a go to firm for class actions
6233798 blogging has massive potential for businesses in general in the uk including law firms the publicity we have had since we started impact nearly two years ago has been massive we have been on the radio been invited to speak at conferences given quotes to national newspapers and have submitted papers technology only moves forward not backwards and the challenge now is to harness the blogosphere for law firms benefit
6233799 the us has a more discussive culture than we do people like to debate things here were more conservative generally and this is especially true among law firms i suspect that cultural barriers will inhibit firms from having blogs for a few years but i hope that well see them taking the requisite leap of faith soon
6233800 blogs help to build a firms constituency they are a marketing tool and much better than the traditional client newsletter theyre a great way of exchanging information and ideas with clients
6233801 in a large corporate firm the compliance culture will lead to problems with signing off posts which in turn has a bearing on the development of the bloggers voice this isnt likely to be such an issue in smaller practices
6233802 as a device within a law firm a blog is a potentially excellent means by which to develop expertise and confidence in new trainees and junior staff as well as a broader network with senior staff as a public information service to existing and potential clients as well as competitors a blog is primarily of value as a branding device however a firm blog can also signal currency both in terms of the content and the means or indeed in matching the activities of competitors and the subsequent expectations of clients

6233807 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6233808 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6233809 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6233810 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all

6233819 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6233820 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6233821 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5
6233822 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6233823 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6233824 while before it was unclear whether poland would go for it or not the czech opposition could object to the concept as a whole

6233827 we have indicated we are not proposing to do something that is compulsory
6233828 but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made
6233829 our policy is clear cut and stated before the election
6233830 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6233831 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6233832 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6233833 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6233834 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6233835 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6233836 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6233837 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6233838 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6233839 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6233840 everyone i have spoken to in town thinks its screamingly funny exactly the same as i did

6233842 we have a terrible imbalance between male population and female population we have always had that problem and he has brought national attention to bear upon it
6233843 i am certain there will be an awful lot of girls going to mt isa

6233864 gracias a vuestras leyes democr ticas os invadiremos gracias a nuestras leyes religiosas os dominaremos los petrod lares que entran en las cajas de arabia saudita y de otros gobiernos isl micos son usados para construir mezquitas y centros culturales en pa ses cristianos con inmigraci n isl mica incluida roma
6233865 el principal argumento era que hubo una total falta de consulta con los padres las escuelas no quisieron hablar con los padres y fueron totalmente autoritarios
6233866 el objetivo era reducir el acoso por homosexualidad pero todo lo que los padres han se alado es que no estaban en contra de esto sino que nos dec an mi hijo viene a casa y habla de relaciones entre un mismo sexo cuando nosotros todav a no hemos hablado de las relaciones heterosexuales con l
6233867 el islam no acepta las relaciones homosexuales como tampoco el cristianismo y otras religiones

6233872 shoeless joe jackson banned from baseball for his alleged role in fixing the 1919 world series returns to baseball in 2008 donruss threads which will include game used bat cards of the legendary black sox figure
6233873 true game used joe jackson items almost never surface on the secondary market theyre kept in private collections or on display in museums
6233874 but sometimes great pieces do find their way into auction passed down from generation to generation as this bat was
6233875 we also expect to sanction our first oil project in vietnam by the end of the year
6233876 looking forward our focus is on delivering the base business and executing our lng and asian growth strategies
6233877 the off market buy back will allow santos to immediately distribute to shareholders some of the proceeds resulting from the joint venture with petronas and will reduce the number of shares on issue
6233878 the final size of the buy back will depend upon shareholder demand and market conditions
6233879 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories

6233883 we have indicated we are not proposing to do something that is compulsory
6233884 but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made
6233885 our policy is clear cut and stated before the election
6233886 this decision follows several weeks of discussions with fa chairman lord triesman on the role of the chief executive within the new fa structure
6233887 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6233888 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future
6233889 we have achieved a lot over the past three years opening the new wembley implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6233890 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success
6233891 on behalf of everyone at the fa i would like to express my sincere thanks to brian for the stability and growth he has brought to the organisation
6233892 everyone i have spoken to in town thinks its screamingly funny exactly the same as i did
6233893 the comment says if you dont happen to look like nicole kidman come to the isa you can have a lot of fun and that says a lot of nice things about the isa and our outback towns
6233894 we have a terrible imbalance between male population and female population we have always had that problem and he has brought national attention to bear upon it
6233895 i am certain there will be an awful lot of girls going to mt isa
6233896 when we country people assert who we are and what we are then you find some way of twisting that around and out a malevolent interpretation upon it
6233897 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6233898 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6233899 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6233900 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6233901 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6233902 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6233903 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6233904 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6233905 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6233906 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6233907 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6233908 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6233909 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6233910 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6233911 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive
6233912 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6233913 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6233914 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6233915 o k so you are turn it on for me then please
6233916 ah yes such an english name isnt it its im isnt he
6233917 er i dont think so i doubt if theyd be motivated to draw anything so conformist
6233918 really dear are you quite sure how did you know that
6233919 coz it looks like him kinda and its got his name on the back
6233920 poland did very well to come back and played very well defensively bt we did well not to lose concentration
6233921 its brazil or china next on paper it would be better to have china but thats unlikely it will probably be brazil
6233922 i cant say that we managed to fully cope with the bulgarians especially kaziyski
6233923 in the first set we were just waking up but after that we managed to play collectively
6233924 as for bulgaria they can play one very good game in any tournament and i was praying before the game that it wouldnt be against us
6233925 it doesnt matter who we play against in semi final
6233926 pretty much everyone knows that growing up in a household where the dad is a professional baseball player the last thing you talk about is baseball
6233927 so you understand history but you dont dwell on it because the father and son relationship is more important than the numbers
6233928 i dont really worry about that everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen but it is good to get the first one at home
6233929 you saw me take off into the tunnel they werent expecting that veteran move
6233930 it was great it was nice to see him have a great day it was awesome
6233931 hes been hitting the ball hard but hitting them on a line we dont need to worry about him hes hit enough of them to prove he can do it but hes been driving in runs even if he doesnt hit homers so hes been getting the job done
6233932 it really feels like a dream right now that i dont want to wake up from to be on the same lineup as a ken griffey jr and jim thome
6233933 in certain lineups hes been hitting behind me and its an absolute honor to be in the same lineup with those guys
6233934 im sure it felt good for him even with as many as hes hit
6233935 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6233936 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6233937 companies that sell these notebooks can get more money for them just as intel can get more money for the chips that fuel them higher margins mean more and better business
6233938 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6233939 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6233940 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6233941 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6233942 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6233943 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6233944 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is whats happening to their mortgages whats happening to their gas and electricity bills whats happening to the oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps
6233945 these are the issues they want us to address and look at thats what we have got to deal with and you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6233946 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written
6233947 these are debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in theres no difficulty with the article
6233948 no one ever makes advance announcements about things like that we are concentrating on the economic issues we are happy with the team
6233949 i thought i was in the lead and only when we got to the stadium i saw her and was a bit surprised but it was too late to do anything if id seen her earlier definitely i would have pushed
6233950 it doesnt really matter if america got the most gold of the olympic games because china will get it back later when we buy their goods which are flooding our markets
6233951 but in general hes right most writers in other media write to create
6233952 fame and glory of it than because they have something new or interesting or even important to say
6233953 and it could be something as petty as the editor you work with leaving and the new one wanting to make his own mark by bringing in all his own people something in times past new editors were
6233954 then if youre working exclusively for one company unless your books
6233955 usually a sizable part of it is working on projects you dont have any inherent interest in
6233956 its been proven that when you do creator owned work your life in the industry is a little longer
6233957 that marvel and dc are producing books solely for an audience crawling toward the grave and insufficient new readers are coming in
6233958 well im not sure open a dialogue about what we work in the
6233959 then rewrite it so that it says what you just said in that language
6233960 as a means of promoting tag body spray hence tag records red bull may be starting
6233961 it could be a word a design element an artist anything really binds them together and can promote the website of their choice subject to my approval
6233962 i may not like them but certainly ill mention them
6233963 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6233964 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6233965 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6233966 i maybe sweated a little bit but not really at all
6233967 we ended up going to the casino and she said shes picking up her bank card
6233968 i could have left the car if i wanted to
6233969 i just wanted to stay in the car and wait for her

6233972 estoy en la mejor disposici n de verla y espero que ella tambi n aunque no hici ramos el amor no importa lo bonito ser a tener una relaci n bonita

6233983 bottom line we were productive and had a very good year but at the end of the day all of the name partners wanted to step back and do their thing
6233984 weve been discussing these issues for some period of time we think both offices will be stronger separate
6233985 we are just looking forward to continuing the practice of law
6233986 kane russell is very attractive to us because they have a full service law firm
6233987 when you have an opportunity to hire someone of chris pappas reputation we were at least willing to look at that hard and obviously after looking at it it made sense because hes a unique individual
6233988 we achieved an awful lot we also were able to take the firm and mold it in a direction that i thought made good business sense you never like to see a divorce as a general proposition but i think its going to be positive for both offices
6233989 the type of practice that the dallas office or the traditional godwin firm has was much more commercial litigation and big dollar bet the company type cases and the belief that that would segue with the houston group just didnt bear out
6233990 chris pappas and his group are terrific people great lawyers and they will do very very well with the kane russell firm
6233991 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6233992 i think we should admire the resolve of the president of france to continue with their troop deployment despite these casualties
6233993 i think we know that we have got to be prepared at a time when we are fighting a very difficult campaign for anything that may happen
6233994 we are also doing everything in our power to protect and ensure the safety of our own forces
6233995 in a bizarre footnote to the scorching race both of the apparent minor medalists churandy martina and wallace spearmon were eventually disqualified for lane violations

6233998 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain
6233999 as far as were concerned shes still here until further notice and until the lord says its her time to go
6234000 she is a passionate and tireless advocate for the people of cleveland and a devoted public servant for all americans
6234001 we send our heartfelt prayers to stephanie and her family at this very difficult time
6234002 the procedure is not one that would be recommended for everybody
6234003 there are definitely groups of patients where this can be done with the same results and fewer complications
6234004 oh that place is just near its only a 10 minute drive
6234005 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in the air crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6234006 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6234007 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6234008 as early as possible as soon as you see there is a potential problem with payments try to get some assistance
6234009 as the coach for the boston breakers of the womens united soccer association in 2003 we talked about changing the point of attack and changing speed and she was average
6234010 i saw her for the first time in december with the u s team and something happened as she decided to get fit and change speed she has been one of the most important players in this team
6234011 its been a few years since ive played forward and i havent been in this position where ive been able to shoot this much and have these kind of scoring opportunities
6234012 being part of the olympics is a huge thing much less being able to play in an olympic final match i love being able to score goals if thats whats asked of me and any way i can contribute im happy to do that

6234017 seria o suficiente existir um registo das queixas na pol cia e se determinada pessoa j tivesse uma queixa por desacatos em estabelecimentos nocturnos ficaria impedido de entrar
6234018 se na inglaterra h pessoas proibidas de entrar nos est dios porque n o fazer isto aqui
6234019 eu acho que teriam de ser referenciados com fotografias ou com alguma identifica o porque podem provocar desacatos noutros estabelecimentos e n s n o sabermos
6234020 s vezes chamamos as autoridades para resolver os problemas e h desacatos entre eles e a pr pria pol cia e n o chegam a ser detidos

6234026 ill bet you i can beat you back to the nbc camera
6234027 are you serious theres no pressure this is what i do
6234028 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox
6234029 what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6234030 debtx is expecting strong interest from local investors because of the manageable size and geographic concentration of the portfolio

6234032 a recent new york times cbs news poll of convention delegates found that 28 percent preferred mrs clinton for vice president by far the largest bloc supporting a candidate
6234033 we also expect to sanction our first oil project in vietnam by the end of the year
6234034 looking forward our focus is on delivering the base business and executing our lng and asian growth strategies
6234035 the off market buy back will allow santos to immediately distribute to shareholders some of the proceeds resulting from the joint venture with petronas and will reduce the number of shares on issue
6234036 the final size of the buy back will depend upon shareholder demand and market conditions
6234037 what next lord are you going to cause one of our cars to explode
6234038 despite the success of our partnership we understand that priorities change and wish chevron the best in implementing its new marketing initiatives
6234039 it has served our texaco and havoline brands well we value the partnership and professionalism of our nascar teams and the support that our loyal nascar fans have provided over the years
6234040 dr ben cunneen hes been a very valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6234041 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6234042 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6234043 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6234044 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6234045 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6234046 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6234047 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories mr moir said behind the zimmerman tag
6234048 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6234049 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6234050 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6234051 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive
6234052 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories
6234053 we will however continue to invest in new stores and the expansion of our existing stores with a view to delivering further growth in returns to our shareholders
6234054 we are not seeing any trend towards driving down pricing
6234055 of course we need to accelerate growth with new clients

6234057 we plan to invest rs 800 crore in fy 09 we will invest rs 600 crore rs 6 billion for the roll out of our mumbai operations while rs 200 crore rs 2 billion will be spent on new licenses
6234058 we dont pass on the entire burden onto the consumers every time the atf prices go up so it is highly unlikely that we will reduce the airfares this month but it also depends on the quantum of atf price reduction
6234059 even if atf prices are reduced we will hold on to the current fares for a month
6234060 we would fix the passenger fares in a day or two after the atf price revision
6234061 just last week we introduced lower advance purchase fares and various special offers for example on the delhi mumbai sector if as expected the atf price is revised downward in the coming months then we would expect to see some additional fare reductions
6234062 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6234063 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
6234064 i dont go to peoples houses and check up on them
6234065 we wanted to draw attention not to a prevalent threat but to a possible future one
6234066 youre asking hundreds of thousands or millions of people to wear something every day for a theoretical risk
6234067 we are so happy that we have made the people of georgia proud with this win after all our troubles back home
6234068 wales are not a small footballing nation and to win is the best day of my life
6234069 its a big result for the country and our new manager hector cuper in his first match because he has now seen the players and will be able to put them in their best positions
6234070 remember my aadvantage number on this computer for my next visit
6234071 they gathered regularly every week on thursdays and sundays a different foreigner used to accompany haywoodsaab to the prayer sessions every week
6234072 we shut the church voluntarily a couple of days after the bomb blasts since ken was stuck in the middle of all this and could not attend to the needs of the church
6234073 even though the rate for shoe shining was only rs 5 he used to pay at least rs 10 and every time he knew a bit of hindi and used to greet me saying kaise ho he also knew a little of marathi
6234074 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6234075 that has enabled scientists to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with a number of obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6234076 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6234077 the real future solution will involve a therapy that specifically addresses each of these
6234078 at this point youd see about 20 different rafts floating down the river the water would be two feet higher
6234079 theres been times that i have talked to someone in knoxville or saw on the news that it rained two inches in knoxville and it didnt do anything here
6234080 obviously knoxville is getting more rain than western north carolina where we need the water to provide for this river
6234081 airme is a free easy to use downloaded application that allows iphone users to take photos and have them instantly tagged and sent to the users flickr or facebook accounts
6234082 we can find no evidence theres been fraud in this case maybe things were improperly done particularly by the county employee who is now deceased
6234083 knox county has looked the other way and this was the only thing i could do as a citizen to have this contractor pay us our money
6234084 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6234085 we want to be on location there are many questions
6234086 certainly this is the kind of political approach we favour
6234087 every country places on the record its views but no one blocks the decision and at the end the germans as chair declare the text adopted
6234088 we will make our presentation explaining our policy restating our bottom line and answering any questions
6234089 the muttahida qaumi movement mqm will endorse and second the ppp cecs recommendation to nominate asif zardari as a presidential candidate
6234090 in case the pml n does not support asif zardaris candidature the ppp will have the support of the mqm anp jui f pml q forward bloc and some smaller parties in the centre and the provinces besides the fata and independent members
6234091 the strike was spontaneous with eight crore people participating in it it is an expression of deep indignation of the masses against the pernicious economic and labour policies of the united progressive alliance government
6234092 this should be a warning bell for the government because if it does not respond we will prolong this agitation the sponsoring committee of trade unions will meet again in september first week to chalk out further course of action
6234093 the government should realise that all the friends of american president george bush are gone and it should be ready to face the same fate if it tries to suppress the masses
6234094 and were here today for the mens 100 meter hewlett packard replacing the toner relay the u s is not favored in this event since nobody we know has ever taken the initiative when it comes to toner

6234096 showered his mistress with large sums of money and expensive gifts
6234097 im glad we have the civil judgment but well probably never see any of that money
6234098 i just hope theyre put in prison so they cant spend it either
6234099 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6234100 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest

6234103 im just so happy the jury did the right thing now ill be able to sleep at night and not worry
6234104 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6234105 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
6234106 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home
6234107 ten a un pariente en el vuelo c mo puedo entrar

6234113 wat we nu zien is een duidelijke hergroepering en ook opnieuw een soort misleidingscampagne
6234114 i didnt mean to do this a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live i apologize for everything please pray for me please
6234115 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6234116 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6234117 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6234118 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6234119 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6234120 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6234121 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6234122 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6234123 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6234124 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6234125 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6234126 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6234127 these incidents have been painful for the victims and their families for priests not involved in these incidents who have served faithfully and for the whole church
6234128 based on advice from legal counsel and on prayerful reflection over this most difficult matter i believe that this settlement while costly is a responsible resolution for these individuals and their families and in the best interest of the diocese
6234129 our clients are trying very hard to right the unrightable wrong
6234130 the civil process is not something that is amenable to righting this kind of wrong but theyre working very hard to try to come to a process where children in the future are protected
6234131 im glad to see this is settled but i feel sad though
6234132 there were so many people involved families good priests good people in the church who have been hurt by this
6234133 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6234134 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6234135 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6234136 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6234137 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6234138 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers

6234142 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6234143 his condition has already deteriorated significantly in the past year
6234144 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6234145 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6234146 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6234147 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6234148 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6234149 its clear that hes getting weaker as it goes on
6234150 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6234151 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6234152 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6234153 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6234154 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point
6234155 why target san diego state im sure this stuff happens in the ivy league too
6234156 theyre trying to say we wasted our time doing this did we no
6234157 it really was only a small number of kids involved but regardless drugs are a scourge in the community
6234158 in the process of weeding it out it got a lot of attention and people may have come to the wrong conclusion that its rampant here
6234159 we have decided to cancel two of our frequencies on the mumbai shanghai san francisco route as we found that mid days are less booked but this decision is temporary and only till november we will review the situation after that but the route has developed well for us with at least 70 per cent load factors
6234160 business travel between the and this load factor is not a year round feeder

6234174 local services including schools bin collections and ferry crossings have been disrupted as thousands of council workers staged a 24 walk out over pay up to 150 000 members of the gmb unite and unison unions joined the dispute across the country after rejecting a 2 5 pay deal over three years the local government umbrella group cosla said it was willing to meet with unions to discuss the dispute
6234175 after you have that first double double from in n out and watch the sunrise in malibu and then get grossed out by a tranny on santa monica blvd youll never want to go back there
6234176 there was kind of a lot of factors that came together
6234177 i dont think there was one thing in particular the timing just wasnt right now to keep pursuing this
6234178 im pleased were taking a second look at this program ive always supported the concept but felt it was hijacked by developers
6234179 i hope we can remove all trace of the rural land stewardship program here i think its one of the biggest growth management mistakes weve made either scrap it completely or significantly alter it i absolutely do not support it in its current form
6234180 well just have to wait and see how it goes
6234181 i was supportive thought it was a great concept but once again the devils in the details
6234182 the way this plan was finally constructed for this specific application theres no benefit to the county theres no benefit to taxpayers
6234183 there are lots of other alternatives in the long run that will preserve the ranch as it is and keep the family on the ranch and keep it viable they dont need a rescue program
6234184 also the review did not thoroughly evaluate the issue of urban sprawl including whether there was a demonstrated need for additional urban uses in st lucie county
6234185 we feel this is a wonderful concept we are disappointed that its not moving forward
6234186 they were going to dump all the traffic from cloud grove into our county
6234187 and they were going to build all those homes before there was any commercial to serve them
6234188 i think well find a way to work through this i think its a great program to protect resources like the adams ranch and be able to sustain mixed use development
6234189 we are seeing homeowners coming in and looking for exotic materials such as onyx to differentiate their homes
6234190 were working very vigorously with the owners of the property to create a deal that makes sense to both of us mitigating our risks and theirs
6234191 we thought we presented a phenomenal project to the county that would benefit the community
6234192 it is under contract with suncor but we dont have any involvement with the development process
6234193 we couldnt get the information we needed from them to do our due diligence
6234194 we made the decision not to go forward with the deal at that point we dropped it and it seemed like they had these other people waiting in the wings
6234195 i have no idea if i did maybe i would have won this tournament a time or two
6234196 he had a backwards hat on and well i dont know he just seemed like a guy who wouldnt be able pull off an elaborate con involving the vatican which is exactly the kind of guy im looking to rebound with and he was wearing a backwards hat

6234198 the wedding was everything we hoped it would be i wish i couldve invited all of you
6234199 but though i regard it as established that we cannot prove there is any thought in animals i do not think it is thereby proved that there is not since the human mind does not reach into their hearts

6234240 when a girl marries she exchanges the attentions of many men for the inattention of one
6234241 what you find is yes there is quite a difference among them
6234242 because the physical response of the headphone and the physics of how they function is not the same
6234243 im not saying they have the same fidelity but you can get rid of the defaults in terms of spacial sound
6234244 theres going to be a limit to what physically that little speaker can do
6234245 in a room the human brain is designed to separate voices you never have problems figuring out who is talking when youre sitting at the same table
6234246 on a phone all voices sound like they are coming from the same place
6234247 since the sounds arrive directly into our auditory canals we lose our natural listening habits
6234248 its as if we were listening with someone elses ears
6234249 everyone can identify the origin of a sound situate objects in space and guess their distance
6234250 it is our brain which interprets the sound information and recreates the spatial sensation
6234251 the small time delay between when a sound arrives in each ear enables the brain to deduce the spot where the sound comes from the difference in levels between the sounds perceived by one ear and the other provides other spatial information
6234252 all these parameters change the colour elevation and tone of sounds
6234253 and they correspond to only one individual because each person has a different morphology
6234254 we can simulate several ear shapes to know which frequencies to filter in order to reconstitute with earphones the same auditory environment that you perceive naturally for example in a concert hall
6234255 with your cellular phone all you will need to do is take a photo of your face and send it to your server we will calculate the audio correction coefficient best suited to your morphology then we will send it to you in the form of a parameters file when you start up your audio player you will only need to select this file in the options menu to have your personalised profile

6234275 these actions based in deception and lies will never lead us to peace we are calling on all of the armed groups to build peace through nonviolence and truth
6234276 this government is dedicated to war and is overriding democratic process by eliminating spaces for dialogue and discussion this will only create more fractions within the armed groups causing more violence and terror there may be more security on the highways but it has been at the cost of greater insecurity on the streets in the cities on the coast the massacres assassinations poverty and hunger persist

6234335 the great thing about bingo halls which have come from cinemas is they tend to retain many of the original features
6234336 the montrose gala bingo hall is no exception at the top of the first floor theres a balcony with tiered seating in it and lovely old cinema seats

6234363 but there needs to be money available to be sure the bridges are in safe condition
6234364 its never popular to vote on a toll increase but it is my conclusion that it is the appropriate thing to do
6234365 it is our responsibility to make sure these bridges are operational and safe the public can be assured that 100 percent of the money will go into these structures
6234366 the drpa is a public authority run on public money and should give credence to public input

6234424 elegy is such a serious oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging and desperate flesh that its a miracle the two central characters a literary star named david kepesh and his much younger lover consuela have as much sex as they do
6234425 the dying animal a brutal short novel by philip roth that oozes like a wound
6234426 human stain to the screen kepesh is cool and watchful and kingsley plays him without a trace of plausible weakness
6234427 elegy has the veneer of fealty it shares some of the books dialogue most of its plot points and characters a bold patricia clarkson plays kepeshs other lover peter sarsgaard his unhappy son and dennis hopper his only friend
6234428 elegy has nothing to do with faithfulness and everything to do with interpretation
6234429 the dying animal with its unloving encounters maddening woman troubles and occasional gynecological descriptions really cries out for a reckless voluptuary like catherine breillat who wouldnt go all soft

6234449 while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6234450 the political process has suffered major delays and is far from where it should be
6234451 i dont see that 2050 goal as very helpful since its so far away
6234452 a 2050 signal is okay but doesnt give us a real basis for agreeing
6234453 great land grab threat at u n climate talks in ghana
6234454 i think this gives small renewable energy projects a lot of credibility

6234472 spoke to a lawyer last night and they said that if you made that statement under deress sic that they can not hold you to that and thats all you have to do is call the prosecutor and tell him the statement was made under deress sic and that it is not true and that is what you will say if they make you testife sic in front of a grand jury
6234473 calling eoannou as a defense witness would have put eoannou and lana between the proverbial rock and a hard place
6234474 however by not calling eoannou to the witness stand lana gave up potentially beneficial testimony for his client lana in short may have been conflicted
6234475 the district court should then consider whether any aspect of that professional relationship including the possible desire to avoid scrutiny of it may have influenced lanas decision to not call eoannou as a witness at ventrys trial
6234476 are you saying he is refusing to be seen by a doctor

6234483 you knew you couldnt save the house but anybody in there that was out first main concern
6234484 there was a lot of smoke coming out of it
6234485 when i opened that door i really had full intentions of going in there but im thanking god she was right there
6234486 both of us had to pull her out on the grass there
6234487 pulling her out of a very intense fire situation the outcome could have been much different had that not have happened
6234488 no im not a hero just in the right place at the right time to help somebody out
6234489 this can be a beginning of the war if not properly handled but it can also as i have said there is still a chance in going back to peace as long as both parties for us and for the side of the government will implement utmost restraint in order to hold back the situation
6234490 sometimes theres truth in old cliches there can be no real peace without justice and without resistance there will be no justice

6234499 they are looking to law firms that have the experience and the depth with a presence in china to help advise them on these complex or sophisticated legal issues
6234500 its tough for these companies to be represented by the smaller firms that dont have mandarin speaking u s trained securities lawyers who are both bilingual and bicultural
6234501 once they get through the listing process its really the beginning
6234502 we want to represent them forever in ensuring adequate and full disclosure
6234503 it takes a special kind of skill set and resource capacity to represent public companies
6234504 some of it is on the ground and some is not its really a question of skill sets
6234505 most sophisticated law firms wouldnt take on those transactions because of concerns about the companies raising ongoing capital

6234519 the suspect has confessed to writing the harassing letters he was exposed through the professional responsible and creative work of the police and the detectives that uncovered his identity are worthy of commendation thus i hope this affair has been terminated

6234529 over the last decade many of our referral sources have become our competitors
6234530 take the work to the general practice firms they are familiar with
6234531 intellectual property has become just another area of federal practice
6234532 there are plenty of smaller companies that want to use smaller law firms for patent litigation
6234533 it really comes down to what kind of attention you want your law firm to give you and since were not a microsoft attention is critical
6234534 but cost is also a major factor behind choosing a boutique
6234535 general practice firms overstaff cases something boutiques just dont do
6234536 but i find there is more flexibility on staffing and pricing arrangements at boutiques
6234537 its great when youre as knowledgeable about the science and technology behind a patent as the other sides expert witnesses
6234538 when lawyers understand the technology its more efficient less time needed from our engineers and lower fees for us
6234539 its hard for a general practice firm to make patent prosecution profitable
6234540 a patent prosecution practice requires a whole different docketing system and financial management system and large firms often have a hard time implementing the systems needed
6234541 it is the poorly prosecuted patents that have problems and end up in litigation
6234542 has allowed us to differentiate ourselves from general practice firms
6234543 a boutique that handles a clients patent prosecution becomes steeped in knowledge of the clients products its competitors and its future
6234544 you just cant fake the technology know how needed for these tasks
6234545 sophisticated clients see through this and direct the work to attorneys who they know are tops in their respective fields which in many cases are attorneys at boutiques
6234546 no matter what the outcome the general counsel can tell the ceo who in turn can tell the shareholders they hired the biggest name available

6234554 we have to restructure our finances so we have a better platform for the future
6234555 the company has not got a proper financing from the very beginning
6234556 if we are not able to it will definitely lead to a situation like that in the long term into the future but not today
6234557 it is a tremendous loss for the whole industry if this yard is not able to recover from this situation that we are into now i cannot see that that can happen
6234558 dont ask what the world needs ask what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
6234559 i was standing outside for my few minutes outside at my cell a vietnamese guard came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his sandal on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together ill never forget that moment
6234560 as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible
6234561 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6234562 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards
6234563 most people dont understand the specific details of how or why these things happen so they simply get a general impression that there was a problem with the product and it makes them very wary of that companys product
6234564 it usually means the company has to spend a lot of money on promotion and advertising that will re establish their credibility one element of that is how they handle the recall
6234565 we fully expected the first half of 2008 to be very difficult for maple leaf due to the extreme inflation and volatility in commodity markets
6234566 we are focused on persevering through these unprecedented market conditions maintaining our focus on executing the structural changes we have committed to and passing on price increases to offset the effects of commodity inflation while the first half has been pressured we believe the second half of 2008 will show a substantial recovery as markets stabilize and the early benefits of restructuring are realized

6234570 tellers at any bank displaying the mastercard logo thats roughly 3 000 banks in missouri will provide cash from the card without a fee and the card can be used at any merchant that takes mastercard and the user can even get cash back
6234571 we seem to have a system that invites abusive and excessive fees
6234572 at the same time were having these mass layoffs that have highlighted the problems the workers here have a union with the ability to deal with the problem but a lot of people out there are running into these kinds of problems but dont even know who to call
6234573 its not unreasonable for the bank to get a fee for providing a service to the state
6234574 but that fee should come from the government contract not from the pockets of unemployment recipients
6234575 we saw that she had the charisma and the body

6234577 the emotion excoriating child rape and abuse is laudable the use of it as an excuse for injustice is not
6234578 for instance no one seems to care about entrapment if a child predator is entrapped to the contrary it is applauded indeed the very word predator connotes a lawless animalistic world ruled by violence where the law is ineffective or beside the point
6234579 reflected societys increasingly aggressive views regarding the sexual abuse of children
6234580 that death penalty advocates thought that the strong emotions that child rape arouses in all of us including the justices would serve as the best wedge to use to expand the application of the death penalty
6234581 perhaps sensing the turning tide in this area and its dangers
6234582 justice david souter joined by justice ruth bader ginsburg dissented
6234583 judge conti told fletcher if anyone would have read the story and acted upon it a little child could have suffered devastation that you would have had to live with for the rest of your life
6234584 the judges remark clashes directly with the supreme courts first amendment jurisprudence which requires a very demanding showing if speech is to be censored on the ground that it advocates unlawful conduct
6234585 fletcher claimed that her intent was not to advocate child abuse but to provide comfort for herself and others who had suffered it

6234600 we want to be somewhere people will see us come up to our friendly crew and shake hands
6234601 this traditionally has been the best show for us businesswise it may have something to do with being able to visit our offices or actually meet us in flesh instead of paying for something thats intangible over the web i just know were returning the favor to michel plante qwebec organizer and founder because he deserves it

6234603 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of
6234604 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6234605 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6234606 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6234607 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6234608 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6234609 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6234610 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6234611 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6234612 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities
6234613 everyone said we could not pull the producers together or get the community involved
6234614 yet we were able to accomplish just that and the changes in the des moines food scene have continued to evolve to this very day
6234615 with a term limited legislature experience becomes even more crucial there isnt much time for on the job training i have the knowledge and experience to hit the ground running

6234619 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6234620 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6234621 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6234622 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6234623 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6234624 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6234625 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6234626 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6234627 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6234628 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6234629 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6234630 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6234631 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6234632 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6234633 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6234634 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6234635 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6234636 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6234637 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6234638 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6234639 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6234640 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6234641 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6234642 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6234643 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6234644 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6234645 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6234646 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6234647 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6234648 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6234649 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6234650 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6234651 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6234652 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6234653 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6234654 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6234655 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6234656 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6234657 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6234658 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
6234659 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
6234660 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction
6234661 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table
6234662 sen barack obama msnbc democrat presidential candidate debate hanover nh 9 26 07
6234663 sen barack obama remarks at town hall event newton ia 12 30 07
6234664 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
6234665 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
6234666 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
6234667 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
6234668 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and
6234669 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
6234670 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
6234671 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
6234672 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6234673 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
6234674 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
6234675 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
6234676 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
6234677 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
6234678 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now

6234754 what would you like to come out of the box if you had your wishes
6234755 by how much by when and how will you measure it
6234756 by 25 by the end of next year and wed measure it by looking at the increase in sales volume per quarter per salesperson
6234757 ok fred now let me explain the black box is not really a black box its a system with people processes policies information and so on what will the black box system need to do to increase sales productivity by 25
6234758 it will need to save the sales people time increase their efficiency so more of their time is spent on selling rather than looking for information and other activities that get in the way and it will need to improve their close ratio make them more effective at selling
6234759 ok fred lets talk about exactly how the black box might achieve those goals lets drill down on how it might improve the sales close ratio to better understand the best possible ways we might be able to do this and how we will measure and track the ability for the system to improve the close ratio

6234773 bones have come to england to film the premiere episode of the fox fourth season and theyve brought all their characters emotional baggage with them
6234774 she says im not an adaptable character says boreanaz explaining that one of the themes running through the double episode is booth
6234775 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
6234776 didnt sleep with ian wexler andrew buchan a british forensic anthropologist clearly upset booth tells brennan shes special then crashes the car while trying to avoid a double decker bus
6234777 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental says deschanel as she waits on the pavement for the scene to continue filming
6234778 bones is often considered a procedural crime drama boreanaz stresses the attraction for him has always been the
6234779 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship he says
6234780 good weather not being something cast and crew had expected greenwich is providing several excellent backdrops including the painted hall of the greenwich royal naval college which is standing in for the interior of the oxford college hall where brennan lectures
6234781 i think one of the best parts has been working with the actors here the talent pool is gigantic says boreanaz
6234782 und dann wird das zeichen des sohnes des menschen am himmel erscheinen
6234783 und sie werden auf mich blicken den sie durchbohrt haben und werden ber ihn wehklagen wie man ber den einzigen sohn wehklagt und werden bitter ber ihn weinen wie man bitter ber den erstgeborenen weint
6234784 den sohn des menschen kommen sehen auf den wolken des himmels mit grosser macht und herrlichkeit
6234785 its a beautiful system thats built to make sure you eat
6234786 we did not want to go public with this because its the sort of thing that frightens people
6234787 ok since youre crying i cant understand what youre saying
6234788 you need to take a deep breath and try to tell me where to send the ambulance so i can send help
6234789 i was all business and i was kind of worried
6234790 when she was having a seizure i checked her pulse
6234791 plus i had to be right by her side in case something happened
6234792 he never did get upset have that freak response or anything
6234793 it means a lot that hes looking after me making sure im okay
6234794 he didnt panic and freak out and sit here and just cry
6234795 in january the then culture secretary categorically promised the commons there would be no more lottery raids to pay for their olympics budget miscalculations
6234796 six months later that promise has been torn up every time the lottery is raided less money goes into grassroots sport yet this is the only way we will secure a legacy for everyone from the 2012 olympics
6234797 funding for our athletes in athens was primarily lottery money in beijing both lottery and exchequer
6234798 for london the package will be lottery exchequer and business
6234799 following our successes in beijing we have great ambitions for our athletes in 2012 and are determined to make sure that investment is in place
6234800 can gordon brown not see there is something fundamentally short sighted in funding the british team by raiding the money going to local and community sports clubs
6234801 if the government had started raising this money earlier our athletes could have had the funding certainty they need without raiding grassroots sports
6234802 this athlete has tested positive her b sample will be opened later today and there will be a hearing tomorrow
6234803 we live in a society where people cheat doping is never in the past we cant lower our guard

6234817 the accusation unfairly and without basis sullies the sterling reputation of mr altman
6234818 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms

6234820 scots irish you know there are a whole bunch of those folks here in virginia alright so yall didnt know but we may be cousins
6234821 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6234822 even today with victory in sight over and over hes advocated withdrawal
6234823 hes made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6234824 will be one of those states where we say wow were still up late waiting for new mexico to come in

6234826 the en posted on thursday 21 august 2008 by don
6234827 the decision to move harry potter and the half blood prince was not taken lightly and was never intended to upset our harry potter fans
6234828 we know you have built this series into what it is and we thank you for your ongoing enthusiasm and support
6234829 if i may offer a silver lining there would have been a two year gap between half blood prince and the much anticipated first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows which opens in november 2010
6234830 so although we have to wait a little longer for half blood prince the wait from that film until deathly hallows will be less than 18 months i am sorry to have disappointed you now but if you hold on a little longer i believe it will be worth the wait

6234836 we treat customers the way we expect to be treated its that simple word of mouth and having a good internet presence takes car
6234837 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6234838 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6234839 while some state appraisal boards do a good job of enforcement for whatever reason whether it be lack of funding or lack of mandatory licensing requirements more than a few do a poor job
6234840 we could not get through the initial 45 minutes and lost four early wickets for 11 runs that changed the whole situation the batsmen will have to take the responsibility
6234841 when we went in to bat we always thought 175 would have been a great score on this wicket and that was our target we knew that we had to make sure that we dont lose too many wickets upfront keep the wickets in hand and drag the game as much as possible but we fail to execute our plans
6234842 we know badri is a talented batsman and a very busy player he batted well for a debutant we knew his abilities during the ipl he handled the situation very well he had dhoni on the other end and they rotated the strike
6234843 im sitting here and im drinking from a carton of milk right now
6234844 and the elitexc lightweight champion kj noons face is on the back of this milk carton because hes missing in action i cant seem to find him
6234845 when noons camp wants to track us down and tell us how nick diaz isnt the right fight for them or they want more money or they want this out of their contract or this and that theyre easy to get a hold of
6234846 we like to think that kj noons is a true champion a true mixed martial artist he realizes the opportunity that hes been given that other mma fighters havent been given the opportunity to be showcased on national television the opportunities for championships the money hes already making we expect him to honor the contract he signed and to fight nick diaz the no 1 contender the only contender right now the leading contender for kj noons
6234847 since day one noons manager mark dion has been insinuating that elitexc has been out to get kj noons
6234848 i just cant figure that out when a guy appears on the very first card and the very first fight gets knocked out in the very first round off the very first punch and were there to hold his hand and pick him back up and put him right back on television in a main event on shoxc
6234849 and then when hes 1 1 get him right back into a main event situation for the world championship against nick diaz the legend who beat gomi how are you going to say that were not trying to help your kid what more opportunity could we give the kid
6234850 maybe the problem with his camp is its called city boxing they think that they can manage a career like a boxer
6234851 i come from the boxing world and these are two totally different careers these contracts are totally different fighters in boxing fight on a per fight basis noons already has a deal that states what hes going to make and when you sign that you already know what youre going to make in your fourth fight so we expect you to honor that
6234852 noons is earning in his next fight about 23 000 to show
6234853 that to me is already more than any fighter who has under 10 fights is making hes highly paid
6234854 theres a spot for kj noons to face nick diaz on the oct 4 card
6234855 if this fight doesnt go off then this a textbook case in business law of harbor it would be called the kj noons case it will be the biggest mismanagement of an athletes career you will ever see this is a chance to maximize his exposure right now
6234856 theres been discussion between the ufc the rose garden and myself we are looking at a november date i believe i should know very soon whether theyve finalized that deal or not
6234857 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6234858 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6234859 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6234860 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6234861 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6234862 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6234863 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6234864 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6234865 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6234866 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends

6234893 separation of church and state was meant to protect the church not the other way around
6234894 the state is not the kingdom of god and the church shouldnt be governed by a popular vote
6234895 history has shown that tyranny occurs when a church and state are combined there is just too much power to handle
6234896 the church belongs to god and the state belongs to man
6234897 did everyone forget that the reason our country was founded was to allow christians to practice their religion
6234898 in the bible when the people wanted a government and a leader and begged god for one he chose a prophet or a godly man doesnt this say something about who god wants to lead
6234899 the government needs a foundational ethical system to make good decisions and laws this can only be done if the two are combined to form one godly entity
6234900 i think that there should be a separation but that godly people should be voted into office to influence the decisions that are being made if the people vote in someone evil then evil decisions will be made it is really up to who the people vote in office
6234901 christians are allowed to practice their religions as well because all of the other religions get to do whatever they want but christians are always chastised for their beliefs
6234902 the motivation of a christians heart is where the lord looks
6234903 it is legal and what if something happened to you that you couldnt pay your bills like being laid off or something
6234904 anyone who says filing for bankruptcy is a sin is ignorant of the scriptures they should read the o t and see what god says about the jubilee
6234905 as in anything the intent and circumstances of which the filing occurs declares whether it is a sin as long as you are not just running up a bunch of bills so you can file bankruptcy and have a legitimate reason its ok
6234906 i think that every seven years in the bible there was financial forgiveness we all make mistakes and god understands
6234907 if you have the money to pay back your creditors then you should if you just dont want to and would rather keep your money then you are wrong
6234908 god says that we are to pay our debts no matter what
6234909 if you love and trust god he will help your situation it is better to be honest with your creditors and try to work out a payment plan then try to get off free from payment bankruptcy results in a mismanagement of money the bible instructs us on money management as well
6234910 the bible speaks of a relief from this world at the judgment for christians
6234911 it says so in the bible it is definitely implied even though the specific word rapture is not used
6234912 the rapture teaches a secret second coming of christ there will only be a judgment in the end
6234913 i learned and even taught the rapture theory for years but then i realized that the theory would require a third coming of christ the third coming is just not biblical
6234914 it really depends on how you interpret the bible passages
6234915 god never promised christians relief from suffering so i dont really know
6234916 i dont know what the word rapture is some things in the bible are just too hard to understand
6234917 the bible commands a husband to love his wife as christ loved the church and the wife is to obey her husband
6234918 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives
6234919 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing
6234920 a marriage is a partnership both are equal and everything should be discussed
6234921 only if he really is a christian and acting in accordance with gods word
6234922 it depends on what the husband is asking his wife to do
6234923 it is the responsibility of the parents to explain the origins of traditions to their children
6234924 halloween was a pagan festival and still is if we participate in it what are we teaching our children
6234925 celebrations should always be about honoring christ and those that behave in a christ like fashion i dont see where halloween falls into that because there is nothing christian about devils day
6234926 its okay as long as you explain to your kids where the holiday originally came from
6234927 in our society today all holidays are commercial they are only still around to buy costumes and candy it is really just like a costume party for kids
6234928 the parents must explain things to the kids and then let the kids decide if they still want to participate
6234929 i really dont know what the real meaning is so i just dont know
6234930 as long as you are not walking around worshipping the devil its fine
6234931 the kids really like this holiday if you take it away from them especially if they go to a public school everyone will make fun of them
6234932 if she was a christian then she was a saint
6234933 she sacrificed her life for helping the poor she used her life to love and serve god so of course she was a saint
6234934 everyone could tell she was a christian by her fruits she brought peace love and joy to everyone that was around her all across the world
6234935 im not sure i mean who really knows unless we die go to heaven and see her there
6234936 only christ can judge whether or not a person is really a christian in their heart or if they are only acting that way on the outside for their own glorification
6234937 i think that she was catholic and those that are catholic must be canonized first to be considered a saint i dont think that the catholic church has officially canonized her
6234938 she was not born again she was catholic and catholics put mary in the same position as jesus they think that she can be an intercessor between god and man
6234939 there are no saints people can not be perfect therefore only jesus was a saint
6234940 she was catholic and the catholic traditions and good deeds along with christ is what she thinks get her into heaven instead of just christ alone
6234941 this doctrine is one of the greatest cancers in the body of christ today
6234942 in 3 john 2 it states beloved i wish that you be in good health and prosperous even as thy soul prospereth
6234943 i have done things my own way and have only failed i have done things the lords way and have been blessed in health love and finances
6234944 all through the bible there are stories of christians living in poverty
6234945 they are only telling the congregation that message in addition to giving money to the church
6234946 the word of god says contentment with godliness is great gain and we have to be content with whatever god gives
6234947 boy is that ever a broad statement i believe god wants us to prosper but not at the expense of our mission to his works
6234948 jesus came as a humble poor son of god with
6234949 what is that i have never read or heard of it
6234950 to defile the human body is to defile the home of the holy spirit
6234951 the human body is gods temple if we defile it with smoking then we defile gods temple and that is a sin
6234952 smoking causes cancer and cancer will kill you therefore you are committing suicide if you smoke and suicide is a sin
6234953 when you smoke you are not only hurting yourself but all those around you with second hand smoke it can cause them to get cancer and that makes you responsible for contributing to their death murder is a sin
6234954 nowhere in the bible does it say thou shalt not smoke
6234955 smoking is a disease it is an addiction and not a sin someone who is addicted needs grace to overcome not judgment
6234956 everything in moderation jesus drank wine but he didnt get drunk does one drink make him a sinner does one smoke make me a sinner i dont think so
6234957 i know it is not healthy but a sin i dont know
6234958 i guess it depends on why you smoke are you addicted or is it your crutch the motivations of peoples hearts determine whether or not their actions are sins
6234959 studies on whether or not smoking kills go in both directions there are plenty of people out there that are perfectly healthy and smoked for 60 years there are also people that died of lung cancer after smoking for only 10 years
6234960 christians should not do anything that will compromise their godly virtues
6234961 christians must be selective with their programming but christ freed us to do whatever we wanted we just have to make informed choices
6234962 as long as the shows are clean no sexual content or violence
6234963 we can all learn something from these shows that may help us deal better with situations in real life if we shield ourselves from television we may not be able to get along in the real world
6234964 i dont know because i dont watch any tv it doesnt matter if your watching day or night there is nothing but smut on have you seen any daytime soap operas lately
6234965 television influences the way you live tv producers are just trying to get their agendas out to the public during a time when many people are watching tv
6234966 prime time television is when most of the shows that have violence are on they also focus too much on sex and sexual innuendos
6234967 the life that only god is able to give begins with conception
6234968 no matter if the baby is deformed or the reason it was conceived once it has been conceived it is a life and nobody has the right to deny that life for any reason
6234969 what if the baby was conceived out of rape or incest and what if it is deformed shouldnt the mother have a choice
6234970 if the pregnancy endangers the mothers life then it should be aborted
6234971 i dont believe in abortion if it is to be used as a method of birth control
6234972 i dont want my personal opinions to influence somebody elses situation legally
6234973 if there is a valid medical reason to abort the baby then the mother should be allowed that choice
6234974 drinking a little bit is not wrong but drunkenness is
6234975 one beer never hurt anyone if you lose control and overindulge then you are wrong
6234976 if drinking a little bit is wrong then why did jesus drink wine
6234977 i dont know anyone that only drinks one beer they usually drink more to get a buzz and that is wrong sometimes they even turn into alcoholics
6234978 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
6234979 there just isnt any good reason to drink alcohol and it is not like it tastes good
6234980 i dont know because the bible only talks about drunkenness with wine and strong drink not about having only one beer
6234981 if you are drinking because you want to dull some area of your life then it is wrong because you are supposed to turn to god when you are in need
6234982 i have hard that wine and other alcohol in moderation can relieve some abdominal pain like ulcers some people are drinking for medicinal purposes
6234983 did roam the earth at the same time as man
6234984 god made the world and all its inhabitants in six days and on the seventh day he rested
6234985 and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the water brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
6234986 nothing but a dinosaur has a tail like a cedar tree
6234987 dinosaurs died 60 million years ago man was not around until 6 000 years ago
6234988 there has been no evidence found that they coexisted instead all the evidence has pointed in the opposite direction
6234989 god made the dinosaurs and everything else that was alive at the time that he made them extinct then he created man in his image to rule over the new animals that he created
6234990 i have seen evidence that supports both theories so i cant decide
6234991 never seen any reference to this claim in the bible
6234992 i dont know and i dont care it would be impossible to find out anyway
6234993 look good against remotes is one thing good against the living thats something else

6234996 if i told the truth it would have devastated my friend some things are just left better off unsaid
6234997 i have only lied about meaningless and insignificant things i dont think that god cares about those
6234998 yes i have lied and i know it is a sin but that is why christ died on the cross for me
6234999 i trust in god i dont even have to tell a little white lie because i know he will protect me and others from anything
6235000 the bible doesnt specifically say the word lie it talks about bearing false witness so i am not even sure if innocent lying is a sin
6235001 i dont think i have on purpose maybe by accident
6235002 i know i have before but i cant remember if i have in the past month i dont keep track
6235003 the bible says that our bodies are the temple of the lord therefore christians should honor god in this area of their life
6235004 we are made after gods image it doesnt matter how fat we are he still loves us
6235005 god didnt make everyone thin and some people are just bigger than others
6235006 some people just cant help it so you cant blame them
6235007 gluttony is a sin and god does not like it
6235008 you are abusing your body when you let it get unhealthy your body is the temple of the lord it belongs to him and not you
6235009 lack of self control and proved a lack of trust in god
6235010 depends on what caused it some people are allergic to medications and some have medical problems
6235011 if you are fat because you eat when you are stressed then that is the problem not being overweight

6235025 praying is the way we communicate with god if you dont pray to him then you dont have much of a relationship
6235026 i pray if i really need to talk to god about something important or if something good happened and i want to thank him
6235027 i wish i could remember before i go to bed but i am just too tired
6235028 i really want to pray more but i just dont
6235029 i dont keep a timetable of my prayers so i dont know

6235044 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6235045 wed joke about how were not sure if a lot of our fans have jobs because theyre always here
6235046 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6235047 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6235048 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6235049 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6235050 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6235051 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6235052 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6235053 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6235054 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6235055 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6235056 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6235057 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6235058 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6235059 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6235060 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6235061 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6235062 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6235063 urban road pricing in norway public acceptability and travel behaviour
6235064 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6235065 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6235066 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6235067 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6235068 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6235069 it seems like when we get down were really down
6235070 it just doesnt seem like we have what it takes to get back up
6235071 guys are fighting for their jobs and their career and others are trying to establish themselves in the big leagues
6235072 there is a reason for everybody every day to go out there and perform and the no 1 reason is you sign a contract that says you are going to do that
6235073 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6235074 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6235075 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6235076 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6235077 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6235078 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6235079 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results

6235085 bj uptons certainly been in the center of a storm
6235086 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6235087 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6235088 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6235089 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6235090 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6235091 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6235092 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6235093 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6235094 addresses would have included de stutevill drive de braose lane daubury close and mowbray way

6235096 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable

6235098 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6235099 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6235100 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6235101 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6235102 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6235103 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6235104 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6235105 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6235106 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6235107 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal

6235111 the past year has been very exciting for us because a record number of leading corporations made the decision to deploy our open dataminer end to end network management platform this includes among others broadcast australia czech television enex gateway communications m6 mtv overon roshan rtl tvi stratos global telstraclear tve upc etc
6235112 but aside from the many customer wins we were also very pleased to see that the existing customer base continuously expands the scope of their dataminer network management platforms

6235114 dataminer is a state of art multi vendor network management platform and dataminer cube underlines our commitment to our customers and business partners that they will continue to be disposed to the best that technology can offer to some people it may come as a bit of a surprise that we went back to the drawing board as our current generation of uis is already ranked at the top but this is all about being prepared for the future and assuring that our customers can continue to operate more and more efficiently even while their technical ecosystems become more and more complex while preserving the qualities of the existing ui and by leveraging the latest technologies dataminer cube embodies an entirely new highly innovative and above all user centric approach on the end to end management of complex technological ecosystems we spent a massive amount of resources in researching ui techniques and scrutinizing the seemingly most trivial aspects and it has paid off you need to experience dataminer cube in order to fully comprehend what it is all about but dataminer cube is truly going to change the way people look at managing the most complex ecosystems and ibc2008 is a unique opportunity for operators to get a sneak preview

6235159 however the whole question of training facilities does seem to be an area worthy of further exploration although the new facility will be capable of hosting international competitions we need to look at the case for a series of other facilities around scotland
6235160 we do want to build a new training facility but its likely to cost 2 3 million and wed obviously need external assistance to pay for it

6235202 he fell into an early hole saturday giving up three runs and six hits to the first nine royals batters he faced they werent hitting the ball hard off of him as three of the hits came on well placed ground balls but mussina wasnt satisfied it still looked like they were comfortable at the plate he said and when theyre standing in there comfortably thats something you dont want to see so mussina adjusted he concentrated on his pitch selection and what he was throwing to certain batters
6235203 yesterday left him looking for four more wins with 38 games left to play roughly seven more starts if all goes according to schedule his era dropped from 3 39 to 3 35 mussina 16 7 has won five of his last seven starts with a loss and a no decision the yankees meanwhile have depended on him heavily going 17 9 in games that he starts

6235216 theres also a very clear feeling that not only do people i think for the most part want to see a higher standard of ethical practice in government and they want trust in government to be rebuilt
6235217 i think its also fairly clear that people would like to see some sort of independent investigation
6235218 theres no doubt that those are the factors that are driving parental choices around which schools to attend
6235219 ill just have another look and finetune the whole thing
6235220 i have been thinking about it over the last few months since this process started but i will just finetune it now and make my intentions known probably in the next few weeks
6235221 ill be sitting down with my family and looking at the options
6235222 what i need is to protect and ensure that all of my existing members of parliament who havent announced their retirement to date actually continue on
6235223 there are any number of communities throughout queensland who are crying out for candidates of the capability of stuart copeland
6235224 a couple of the towns that have been split in two have now been put into the various electorates as a whole body
6235225 i dont think its beneficial to any town to be cut in two theres always a quip going around that oh youve got two members or three members going to represent you but it doesnt work like that
6235226 so i think they should be really pleased and i think overall its a good outcome for the nanango electorate
6235227 i will be endeavouring to put out a flyer to let people know how the boundaries have actually changed for them and that they will be in the nanango electorate in the future
6235228 that will happen between now and christmas i will try to get to everybody
6235229 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6235230 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6235231 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6235232 o decreto n o inventou nada de novo mas h alguns defeitos
6235233 we would be hoping for some time in october to be commencing the service all things going well
6235234 all of our staff are fully trained and accredited to deliver this pet ct service and we certainly meet all of the conditions that the government have requested that we meet
6235235 this is one of these great alarming gaps in the health service in tasmania in that the private sector comes under the commonwealth and the public sector comes under the state minister currently lara giddings
6235236 somehow through coag or through direct discussions with the state minister and the commonwealth minister this has got to be sorted out
6235237 one of the cool things about digital slr cameras and top of the line cameras is that you can control the shutter speed to either stop or blur action
6235238 when i photograph fast moving animals and even slow moving ones i often choose to freeze the action because i want a sharp photograph a shutter speed of 1 500th of a second is usually fast enough to freeze most fast moving animal action but when the animal is moving extremely fast as was this seagull in flight i had to use a 1 2000th of a second shutter speed

6235248 the shares are probably rising after the comments but they are what he thought in a personal capacity the question is what adecco is prepared to pay
6235249 we think the ownership structure is secondary the focus should be on strengthening the regulatory system
6235250 that is the way to create the capacity which is most needed especially at heathrow
6235251 being here beats every cyclocross for the rest of my life it gives me goose bumps
6235252 we are delighted by the decision which we have been calling for for years
6235253 this will bring new capacity lower prices and better service
6235254 airports are individual monopolies selling a monopoly to a new owner will not help protect the consumer or improve efficiency airports need better regulation
6235255 a break up of baa is a step forward but it is the bronze medal at the consumer protection olympics a gold medal would be a better more effective regulator
6235256 this together with the new orders which we hope to secure in the next few months will give us the stability to trade through this difficult period for the construction industry and economy in general
6235257 i wear a bra all the time except when i go to sleep
6235258 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum

6235270 use this misery as an excuse to gut education and health and human services without the need for any public policy debate for a position that you could not hope to defend
6235271 you want limits that reduce government beyond growth and the cost of living

6235280 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6235281 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6235282 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
6235283 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives

6235287 the washington posts white house reporter michael abramowitz was asked yesterday during a chat to name some of his
6235288 i like your question one of the things you find in covering the white house is that many of the staff are extremely friendly and dedicated and its fun to get to know some of them the truth is reporters tend to hang out with the people in the white house press office so the names i might give you tend to be lower level press aides like carlton carroll stuart siciliano and pete seat and spokeswoman emily lawrimore they are extremely helpful to me and i dont mean this list to be all inclusive i also enjoy talking with deputy chief of staff joel kaplan and deputy national security adviser jim jeffrey i wouldnt be surprised if joel is one day a cabinet officer or a ceo somewhere he has an interesting life story he joined the marines after graduating from harvard then became a lawyer and is basically the top aide to chief of staff josh bolten of course joel and others i mention are extremely discreet so its not like anyone is really dishing on the president you need to look elsewhere for that
6235289 it delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday
6235290 apparently the tsa inspector hoisted himself up using the tat probe as a stirrup
6235291 we caught it this time but who knows if this has happened other times and with other planes that are out there
6235292 pilots are the last line of defense we do our pre flight inspections but we dont have a system in place to check for broken parts
6235293 it is not tsas intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections
6235294 the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected which is an apparent violation of the airlines security program
6235295 tsa is reviewing the inspection results and depending on the conclusion could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties
6235296 is confident that it followed all proper security procedures for securing aircraft overnight at chicagos ohare international airport
6235297 if not observed by vigilant eagle employees in chicago the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew
6235298 to look for and test among other things access vulnerabilities or areas were someone with ill intent could gain access to the aircraft
6235299 aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended

6235302 theres no way we can offer blanket compensation in fact no telco will do that all telcos have clauses in their customer contracts that say we cant be held liable for consequential damages if communications networks go down
6235303 but we have asked our customers to contact us and work with their account managers if they have problems
6235304 the irony is that very few customers have got in contact with us about compensation most customers who contacted us were serious and obviously significant corporates
6235305 the industry is not in a sustainable position to invest in infrastructure until we get clarity on the national broadband network
6235306 until then we will not be able to finalise what we need to do in terms of investment nor will anyone else this is not exclusive to optus
6235307 it makes me sick that someone would vandalize something that means so much
6235308 es una pena que un gobierno emanado de nuestras filas haya tenido ese actuar tan negativo espero que sean atendidas todas las recomendaciones de la cdhdf porque es lo menos que podemos hacer
6235309 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much the associated press mccain chides a newly feisty obama as testy
6235310 we worked through a lot of stuff i feel confident moving forward
6235311 even though i made the deal i still feel passionately about that
6235312 i do not want to see eminent domain used on any of the businesses here
6235313 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6235314 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6235315 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6235316 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6235317 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6235318 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6235319 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6235320 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6235321 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6235322 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6235323 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6235324 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6235325 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6235326 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes
6235327 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6235328 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid smoking and avoid drinking too much also check for diabetes and blood pressure at least once a year
6235329 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6235330 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6235331 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6235332 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6235333 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6235334 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6235353 were expecting a crowd somewhere in the range of 9 000 to 10 000 the last few years we played cathedral weve typically had a crowd of 7 500 to 8 000
6235354 we cant measure the good that its going to do for our school its above dollars and cents
6235355 one of the issues sometimes we struggle with when were bringing in companies from the coast they wonder what our school system is like this is an opportunity to show off how good our school system is

6235374 we didnt know anything about how booking stuff worked or promoting and all that
6235375 im hoping that we can start putting music out more
6235376 thats probably why we wanted to do those covers for free just instant gratification throw them out there and let people download them right away our album came out two months ago and now we have another album of covers for free for people i like bands that do that
6235377 i think were sort of blessed in that we are all pretty good friends
6235378 there are a lot of bands that are bandmates before theyre friends and thats kind of weird to us
6235379 by the time we were done with the album all i wanted to do was get on the road and play our songs but now im really itching to get back into the studio
6235380 why i write songs in the first place is to get in the studio and start working i really like to use the studio to its full potential as another instrument or whatever then playing live is a completely different experience thats really great as well
6235381 ive been messing around with a bunch of different things just trying to expand our palette

6235393 so far there have been more than 300 complaints to the national consumer direct helpline
6235394 the website has been up for four or five months
6235395 we alerted the authorities to this some months ago because the prices they were offering for tickets were simply not achievable
6235396 they were offering a weekends camping at these festivals for 200 and that is not a realistic figure

6235401 la realidad del deporte mexicano es una constante cada cuatro a os desde hace mucho tiempo

6235405 el siguiente paso es una secretar a una subsecretar a del deporte o un instituto para que en un momento dado tenga m s desarrollo a nivel nacional m s control en la parte deportiva
6235406 hay gente que no tiene perfil que no sabe de administraci n que desgraciadamente en lugar de apoyar en la parte administrativa no aporta y pone obst culos y no permea para poder unir al deporte

6235441 having an operation cancelled can cause huge distress for patients and their families
6235442 its simply unacceptable that these figures are so high and that the government is spinning the official statistics to try to hide them
6235443 nhs staff are doing the best they can but how can they plan patients care properly when they are continually hampered by labours top down targets

6235469 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6235470 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6235471 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said
6235472 there was a point in two a days where his arm wasnt as live all those little things youve got to struggle through during two a days but i think the last week hes started to get back to where he was at the end of spring ball he has a pretty good comfort level i think in terms of his knowledge of what were doing
6235473 they all want to see the ball in the air the thing you want them to understand is that we are going to be a balanced offense we like throwing the ball i like throwing the ball but i do believe you have to run it to win thats something we always did real well at louisville people had to defend our passing game and then we ran the ball real well
6235474 i think we can because what we do is that weve always molded the offense to the quarterback
6235475 heres some cool stuff you can do with these new tools
6235476 people start real blogs because they think about something a lot maybe even five things but their brain so overflows with curiosity about a family of topics that they cant stop reading and writing about it they make and
6235477 the point is that great technologies probably do sell themselves the web is mostly filled with bad technologies though and its the job of the technology press to find the good ones with occasional discoveries of greatness can pr
6235478 this is all wrong the single grrrrl is pregnant what
6235479 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6235480 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6235481 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6235482 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6235483 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6235484 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6235485 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks
6235486 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos
6235487 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me
6235488 its scary a little bit but youve got to play through it
6235489 theyre not filing any criminal charges and its because theres insufficient evidence
6235490 pulling jj off of a bunk bed ladder and hitting the side of the dresser with his body
6235491 he was a typical happy beautiful little boy with a bright future ahead of him and now its all gone
6235492 up at the hospital he was saying oh well i feel bad because i found him and i should have been watching him better but never did come out and say that he had hurt him
6235493 why did he hurt my baby i want to know why what could have made him so angry that he hurt my baby my angel i just dont understand and right now there are no answers
6235494 there is no way she would have let him in her life much less those boys life if she ever thought there was even the remotest chance that he was going to hurt those boys
6235495 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me

6235497 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
6235498 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
6235499 that is extremely unhealthy and they really need to do something about that soon
6235500 it has funded new processing and packing lines which means that we will be able to process 100 000t of potatoes this year thats a 40 000t increase
6235501 having the capacity to produce all these products will help us to reduce waste
6235502 potatoes which are too small to be made into chips for example can now be used for mash previously they were thrown away
6235503 only a few years ago we were buying all our requirements at weekly auctions
6235504 it was high risk and we had no relationships whatsoever with suppliers or growers
6235505 it also gives us the traceability that our customers are asking for as well as continuity of supply and reduced risk
6235506 thats why we are working with the higgins group they have the necessary skills
6235507 were involved all the way along from the development of new varieties for processing right through to installing potato handling facilities at factories and staff to manage stock
6235508 there are three hurdles that they have to clear the first is field performance the second is the cook test and the third is their suitability to factory processes it theyre expensive to grow or process they wont be used
6235509 heinz and kettle are the two closest processing outlets to us but we also have companies such as mccains in the region
6235510 its true that imports are now more expensive which works in our favour but logistics costs have gone up for us too
6235511 our customers are looking at these things more and more now we can tick those boxes
6235512 being able to move volume has made the operation much more efficient
6235513 our fuel and nitrogen costs have doubled in the last year
6235514 compound fertiliser has trebled in price while land and machinery costs have gone up by 20
6235515 its interesting to see that some companies are introducing contracts worked out on an agflation basis that could become more commonplace

6235522 we are looking for players to step up and have the confidence to take control of the game and to get the ball into the back of the net
6235523 our defense turned in 11 shutouts last year and we know we have a very solid group coming back it is a great feeling to have so many returnees and have that much experience with your defense
6235524 we have 30 players on this years team so we know we have a challenge in getting all of them on the same page especially when dealing with 14 new players
6235525 were going to play different systems and different lineups during the preseason and beginning of the season and whatever lineup we finalize will definitely influence and determine what we will play on offense
6235526 we just have to remember its not easy you have to work hard for everything you want with replacing so many starters on the attack we know there will be adjustments early and how well we do that will be the key to our season
6235527 brie has shown a true sense of leadership among the defenders from the center back position and is such a hard worker that shes very hard to beat
6235528 mack is very vocal and a good leader and her ability to organize the defense has been key to our success
6235529 shannon is very good in the air and can change the point of the attack while brianna possesses a great final pass and reads the game well amanda is probably the best finisher of the three and also knows how to keep possession of the ball
6235530 hailey is a very crafty player and will fight hard for us
6235531 ashleigh has very good pace and is a dangerous offensive threat we expect her to fight for a starting spot during the preseason
6235532 its a challenging schedule for us playing on the road for three of the first four weekends and all against tough competition but it will be a good challenge and help bring the team closer together earlier

6235558 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years alot of that was orchestrated through her management it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it

6235585 elegy is such a serious oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging and desperate flesh that its a miracle the two central characters a literary star named david kepesh and his much younger lover consuela have as much sex as they do
6235586 the dying animal a brutal short novel by philip roth that oozes like a wound
6235587 human stain to the screen kepesh is cool and watchful and kingsley plays him without a trace of plausible weakness
6235588 elegy has the veneer of fealty it shares some of the books dialogue most of its plot points and characters a bold patricia clarkson plays kepeshs other lover peter sarsgaard his unhappy son and dennis hopper his only friend

6235634 the greens are smallish you have to hit a perfect shot you have to know which side of the green to be on they are by no means flat but they are very playable
6235635 its a very nice golf course obviously very typical to the area a lot of big trees
6235636 the greens are small for the majority so its a good tough golf course and i think its going to be a great test
6235637 these things happen and im sure well be back there soon
6235638 so this is also a good course obviously ive done well there at westchester but you just gotta move on
6235639 thats one of the smallest greens youll play on tour
6235640 ive never heard anybody say anything negative about this golf course
6235641 you cannot just come here and think youre going to hit the ball a long way and get away with it
6235642 i think if the members played the speed of the greens that we played theyd all quit i dont think there would be any members left there so i dont know what the pga was going at
6235643 this is what all the players look forward to playing a golf course of this nature
6235644 the greens are smallish you have to hit a perfect shot you have to know which side of the green to be on they are by no means flat but they are very playable

6235656 we had a kinda slow start but its been going better
6235657 we have runnin 2 engines like 12 hundred horsepower yea its a lot of power
6235658 they should see a healthier lake and of course were also creating quite a bit of fish habitat in this area

6235660 we have to strengthen control measures in ivory trade to abide by provisions of the convention in in endangered species cites which requires specific legislation
6235661 and until that is in place dealing in ivory products will be prohibited
6235662 we do what we can to get them out and out for walks during the day if have lots of volunteers coming down here to walk the animals but on days that no one comes the only fresh air that the dogs will get is when and if i have an opportunity to get them out
6235663 we get people from every walk of life that come along on a ride its organized to a point every sheriff will leave their checkpoint at 9 oclock in the morning on a group ride
6235664 drive their car if they would like if they dont have a motorcycle were open to other folks coming along with us or running the route on their own weve had handicapped folks do that theyre very welcome to come
6235665 its been going up about 3 to 5 calls a year for us the last five years
6235666 you try and save where you can but with a volunteer fire department going out cover 42 square miles its something you dont worry about people come first

6235679 it means a lot to these kids that they actually get to show on their show day and show with their friends a lot of them last year didnt get to show with the friends because they had to go back to school and didnt get to show with their friends
6235680 were trying to get this covered so all kids will always get a chance to show no matter what
6235681 were just trying to do whatever we can to raise money for the pavilion
6235682 we invest so much time and money to get costumes and work with the horses for us to not be able to show at the fair at the end of that is just really disappointing it was very hard last year its been great this year

6235687 many paramedics have never seen anything like this in their lives
6235688 it just didnt look anything like an aircraft it was horrific everything was burnt
6235689 it is horrible i just dont want to tell you about it i dont want to describe it
6235690 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6235691 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers

6235694 dave evans will be at the red lobster this weekend
6235695 visitor nights are at record levels largely because of the focus that grand pacific drive has given our marketing
6235696 in fact the region has defied the national trend by registering a 15 per cent hike in domestic day visitors and 10 per cent more domestic overnight stays for the year to march according to just released tourism nsw data
6235697 and were looking down the barrel of another record summer as sydneysiders spooked by rising petrol prices look for closer to home breaks this holiday high season
6235698 giving it a big tick was really a no brainer and the whole concept just took off especially when the federal government got behind it with a 499 700 australian tourism development program grant
6235699 the money helped us to run a marketing and pr campaign to promote grand pacific drive around australia and internationally and install a series of very effective directional and interpretive signs to highlight the drive on the southern freeway out of sydney
6235700 since the bridge opened weve gained six new hotels as well as the stunning new illawarra fly tree top walk near robertson a new apt day tour out of sydney several exciting new thrill rides at jamberoo action park now the largest theme park in nsw and enthusiastic engagement by the local industry and tourism wholesalers who are now offering local holiday packages in 14 overseas markets
6235701 cooperation at a local government level has never been stronger with councils right along grand pacific drive agreeing to a finely tuned blueprint that we believe is setting new standards for co involvement
6235702 it is now clear that we need a significant easing in interest rates
6235703 this is the slowest growth rate of the index since july 2001 and the sharpest fall in the growth rate since 2000
6235704 there is a strong case for the reserve bank to move by a larger amount by 0 5 particularly given that at the beginning of a rate cut cycle its best to have your biggest move because thats when its safest because thats when rates are at their highest

6235706 clark is renowned for her managerial skills the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
6235707 she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz
6235708 if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
6235709 but equally its hardly productive and the bigger point is it shows a considerable lack of professionalism among key parts of the foreign ministry
6235710 we didnt know anything about how booking stuff worked or promoting and all that
6235711 im hoping that we can start putting music out more
6235712 thats probably why we wanted to do those covers for free just instant gratification throw them out there and let people download them right away our album came out two months ago and now we have another album of covers for free for people i like bands that do that
6235713 i think were sort of blessed in that we are all pretty good friends
6235714 there are a lot of bands that are bandmates before theyre friends and thats kind of weird to us
6235715 by the time we were done with the album all i wanted to do was get on the road and play our songs but now im really itching to get back into the studio
6235716 why i write songs in the first place is to get in the studio and start working i really like to use the studio to its full potential as another instrument or whatever then playing live is a completely different experience thats really great as well
6235717 ive been messing around with a bunch of different things just trying to expand our palette
6235718 ive been listening to a lot of shoe gaze stuff of late i think were going to try to add a lot of different sounds on the new record
6235719 we dont ever want to be waiting around for things to happen
6235720 we just want to keep having something were working on all the time and keep going as long as we can
6235721 as a result of its national growth strategy which includes expanding in existing areas while entering new markets throughout the country dunkin donuts is able to offer this rare opportunity to a qualified franchisee candidate who might be interested in purchasing a small to mid range number of units outside of a larger metropolitan area
6235722 the added value is the ability to offer the franchisee the opportunity to become the face of the brand and to set the direction for their designated market in addition due to the economy franchisees may find more attractive real estate opportunities in these markets
6235723 dunkin donuts offers franchisees a variety of designs and venues including free standing stores sites within shopping centers and convenience stores and other retail environments
6235724 its hard to commit to an exact time frame as we just opened the market for franchise sales typically it depends on how many stores are planned for each market and how quickly real estate and build outs are finalized we would anticipate openings within one to two years and reaching completion of the market build out in five to seven years
6235725 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6235726 the plan today is to use an inflatable sling to try to get the whale further out to sea where he might hook up with another pod of whales
6235727 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6235728 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales
6235729 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
6235730 hes been a valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6235731 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak
6235732 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds
6235733 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
6235734 i think it was just a miscommunication i believe they thought it was public parking and they thought it would be okay to refer people to the plaza
6235735 i was watching tv news last night and that was the first time i heard about parking at the plaza
6235736 for example when one of our presidential candidates spoke here recently he used our plane and immediately paid us the full value of that flight even though he was speaking at liberty
6235737 i just feel that we should all try to accommodate people in a christian and spiritual way
6235738 i take issue with the fact that you deny people the right to park at something that nobody is using
6235739 its true wed be a little more tempted to help on the other side but the law says we cant so we feel like were being transparent about it
6235740 history is in the making here i am a part of this this is the first time in a presidential election that i have seen a presidential candidate i am excited about the possibilities i am excited about barack
6235741 i have already decided who i am going to vote for i am just interested in whats going to be said
6235742 i like the way he inspires while i may not agree with his policies i would lean more towards that type of inspirational leadership that who can take and lead us to the next level and i think weve been missing that in the last eight years
6235743 weve empowered iran weve distracted ourselves from dealing with al qaida news and afghanistan bin laden is still sending out audio tapes thats bad decision making those are the sorts of decisions john mccains made so if you look at the track record of judgments over the last five years i think its john mccain who probably has not shown himself able to lead the country at a time when weve got a lot of big strategic decisions that we have to make
6235744 it was just so great to see a man of that stature right in danville virginia
6235745 i am so excited i got a chance to shake his hand this is so wonderful
6235746 it gets mccain people fired up too having him here gets everybodys attention it gets the republican grassroots attention theyre motivated and theyve been calling asking where can we get our mccain stuff
6235747 four brands instead of one and more distribution to be able to cross sell
6235748 four brands instead of one and more distribution to be able to cross sell

6235771 lord jabberwock dont sneak up on me like that you startled me
6235772 all six thousand two hundred seventy eight have been given to the white rabbit for him to deliver
6235773 and if he fails to deliver all of them before nightfall hell kindly escort himself to the dungeons for a cup of tea a poetic recital and finally the guillotine
6235774 there is no worser crime than failing my lady queens instructions
6235775 of course not but if it were it would be accurate to the situation
6235776 my apologies but as for the white rabbit if he should fail i think you should have the honor of giving the order
6235777 your eyes are red and there is a tear dripping down your lovely cheek
6235778 what is this thing you call sanity it sounds horrid
6235779 go about your business then lord jabberwock and i shall go about mine
6235780 but way too fast listen honey you should see a doctor it isnt healthy or natural to lose weight so fast maybe youre sick
6235781 i didnt know what to do because all of these things were happening in my life these tragic circumstances
6235782 so i basically spent three months of my life just trying to find myself
6235783 everything i play is based on some knowledge of traditional american music
6235784 but im not doing it in a traditional way im trying to create new music not just new words but new musical forms things that are interesting things that might appeal to a broader audience than just hard core blues or traditional aficionados
6235785 i think by age 10 it was pretty clear he wanted to play music and be on stage
6235786 i was young and risk was not really something that i thought about too much
6235787 i can remember when he was maybe 4 years old he could shimmy up a flagpole to the point where youd have to shout to tell him not to go up any higher
6235788 hes fearless it can be a good characteristic or it can be a bad characteristic
6235789 youre shooting for capturing this moment in time between these musicians
6235790 but its not going to happen im too proud to let that go im already so deep into this i dont think theres much of a way out of it ill just keep plugging along

6235792 bones have come to england to film the premiere episode of the fox fourth season and theyve brought all their characters emotional baggage with them
6235793 she says im not an adaptable character says boreanaz explaining that one of the themes running through the double episode is booth
6235794 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
6235795 didnt sleep with ian wexler andrew buchan a british forensic anthropologist clearly upset booth tells brennan shes special then crashes the car while trying to avoid a double decker bus
6235796 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental says deschanel as she waits on the pavement for the scene to continue filming
6235797 bones is often considered a procedural crime drama boreanaz stresses the attraction for him has always been the
6235798 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship he says
6235799 good weather not being something cast and crew had expected greenwich is providing several excellent backdrops including the painted hall of the greenwich royal naval college which is standing in for the interior of the oxford college hall where brennan lectures
6235800 i think one of the best parts has been working with the actors here the talent pool is gigantic says boreanaz
6235801 there was easily 100 cops easily and then they had the intervention teams and fire departments and the ambulance and rochester city lines because when they evacuated the families they made them sit on the bus so they had water and were cool and whatnot
6235802 there was a knock on the door me and my wife went downstairs there were police in the living room telling us we were being evacuated because there was a gun in the area and we were sent down to a bus we were allowed to grab my medicine
6235803 he finally surrendered the cops had him all surrounded they stood by cop cars by the swat team and took him put him in handcuffs and put him in the car
6235804 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
6235805 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
6235806 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
6235807 we are not here against the afghans but with the afghans so they are not left alone to face the barbarism
6235808 one it was a 16 year old and two it was a 16 year old female
6235809 i didnt know what to do because all of these things were happening in my life these tragic circumstances

6235818 but its not going to happen im too proud to let that go im already so deep into this i dont think theres much of a way out of it ill just keep plugging along
6235819 if you remember 2004 it could be that bad water everywhere sinkholes overflowing retention basins
6235820 this is probably one of the most difficult storms ive seen in terms of having to make decisions based on the forecasted track
6235821 keeping ahead of the storm becomes difficult when it slows down weakens strengthens again heads out over the ocean then heads back over the coast again weve been in and out of the tropical storm force wind field off and on for the past few days
6235822 the thing hasnt moved more than 20 or 30 miles all day
6235823 one model shows it moving 30 to 40 miles in the next 48 hours
6235824 people who have lived through one storm here know what to expect
6235825 if theyre new to the area they should talk to their neighbors its not just a matter of where you are its the design of your home you may not be in a low lying area but if your garage door sits at the bottom of a hill you may still get water coming under your door its important to assess your personal situation and not just rely on whether or not youre in a low lying area
6235826 and there are isolated places throughout the county where its going to feel like youre walking on a wet sponge
6235827 i think its one of those things i suppose you have to celebrate the anniversary some way but most of us would kind of like to forget it
6235828 i think part of whats going to be remembered is how sudden it was in ottawa and findlay for good or bad it happened over time ours was a true flash flood event it caught everyone by surprise and it was gone just as quickly
6235829 i believe it was april until we actually started producing concrete again id say our total loss was probably in the area of 90 000 to 110 000
6235830 theyve continued to help through the year its just a tough situation is all i can say everybody got shellacked here but everybody helped out
6235831 the community was fantastic part of the problem we had was the people were concerned we had things cleaned up so quickly they were afraid the federal emergency management agency would come in and not see the damage

6235847 we are not claiming complete executive power we are talking about sharing executive power

6235856 we still havent defined the role of america in a post soviet world let alone a post 9 11 world
6235857 theres so much going on between the election and the goofy that is neither and i think after the election in part its going to be a little bit of a relief to have the whole wide world to cover rather than just the election to chew on

6235862 people have realized that the complete removal of the feminine element from the christian message is a shortcoming from an anthropological viewpoint it is theologically and anthropologically important for woman to be at the center of christianity
6235863 that there may be an increase in the number of those who as volunteers offer their services to the christian community with generous and prompt availability
6235864 the issues are similar to the defence force just because you dont have a war doesnt mean you disband the army navy and air force
6235865 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6235866 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6235867 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6235868 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6235869 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6235870 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6235871 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6235872 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6235873 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue
6235874 we knew however that we could improve the power to weight ratio with several select modifications lamborghini has its gallardo superleggera ferrari its f430 scuderia and dodge its viper acr now the corvette z06 has the clubsport package from katech performance

6235882 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further
6235883 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible

6235932 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6235933 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6235934 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6235935 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6235936 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6235937 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6235938 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6235939 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6235940 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6235941 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6235942 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6235943 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6235944 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6235945 new jersey doesnt have teams other than the devils so the jets and giants are new york new jersey teams anyway

6235951 i sincerely regret that i used a term which i find to be offensive and inappropriate and sincerely apologize for offending or hurting anyone by using that term i used it once during a heated argument with my ex husband during our long bitter painful and difficult divorce he secretly taped the private conversation in my home as he continued harassing me the release of this private information is being investigated by my attornes for libel and slander claims i take my responsiblities very seriously and will make amends for my mistakes i have spoken to my pastor and i pray that i will be forgiven for any transgressions i have made

6236066 one of the main reasons for privatising baa as a single entity was for investment in new capacity
6236067 but in terms of runway capacity this has not happened
6236068 as the owner and operator of the three major airports in the london area baa has to be regarded as responsible for their achievements and any shortcomings
6236069 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6236070 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6236071 the overriding priority for aviation markets is the need to increase airport capacity in line with the 2003 air transport white paper ownership of airports is secondary to this

6236076 nonetheless borrowing now looks set to overshoot by at least 10bn this year and possibly much more

6236078 there is little doubt that they are facing difficulties on both the food and non food sides of the business the tns data was breathtakingly bad

6236082 its a career case one of those cases that students go to law school and they all kind of dream about i spent the best years of my career litigating against the largest chemical company in the world they hired squadrons of lawyers with amicus briefs filed by guys like ken starr there was enormous risk and frankly enormous success financially

6236092 our three year investment programme is well under way and we are delighted by the performance of our new stores which were opened earlier this year in both belfast and high wycombe
6236093 currently a seller could pay as much as 1 30 to list a single fixed price item for a maximum of 10 days that will now come down to a flat rate of 40p regardless of the price of the item and will be on the site for up to 30 days up from 10
6236094 the main focus is to grow the site to appeal to retailers at the moment it is used by very few retailers and ebay sees potential in growing itself as a platform for anyone to buy anything
6236095 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6236096 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
6236097 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6236098 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6236099 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
6236100 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6236101 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6236102 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6236103 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6236104 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6236105 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
6236106 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
6236107 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
6236108 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
6236109 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
6236110 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
6236111 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
6236112 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
6236113 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
6236114 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
6236115 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
6236116 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6236117 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6236118 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
6236119 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6236120 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6236121 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6236122 the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6236123 this creates an attractive entry point to an abundance of near term exploration and appraisal drilling also further exploration success could make tullow an m amp a merger amp acquisition target next year
6236124 fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment we maintain our year end wti west texas intermediate price forecast of 149 per barrel
6236125 this years dividend looks secure but what about next bts cash flows continue to come under pressure from lower margins and higher capex capital expenditure
6236126 the bank of england monetary policy committee meeting minutes had sparked hopes of a cut in interest rates
6236127 but the oil price has balanced that and there is a worry that inflation may kill any chances of a cut
6236128 we believe the leading uk operators premier inn which is owned by whitbread and travelodge privately owned are best positioned to consolidate the highly fragmented independent budget hotel market and increase market shares without risking overcapacity
6236129 people are talking about an improved bid after steve ingham michael pages chief executive said that a sale was possible at 600p a share they probably wont get that high a price but it shows the possibility of a sale
6236130 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6236131 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6236132 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what us treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
6236133 a formal process was initiated in june to seek proposals to accelerate the development of origins csg reserves and we have short listed a number of global participants in the energy industry each of which has proposed a csg to lng project
6236134 shareholders should be aware that the average broker 12 month share price targets ranging from a 17 01 to a 20 00 are materially above bgs offer furthermore origins average daily share price has been above a 15 50 since origins rejection of this price on 30 may
6236135 origins directors simply assert that bg groups all cash offer undervalues the company but there is no evidence to support this view nor is there any forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
6236136 while negotiations are ongoing with time warner it appears very unlikely that an agreement will be reached before the first game of the year and anything beyond that is problematic
6236137 it appears the university is not being fully briefed on the status of the negotiations
6236138 weve had positive discussions with fox in recent days including the active exchange of proposals
6236139 theres no stalemate or breakdown in discussions as smiths letter would have our customers believe on the contrary talks are moving in the right direction
6236140 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective

6236168 the apocalyptic opening lines seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market
6236169 as we anticipated the commercial property market has become more challenging in response to the credit crunch and slowing economies there is confusion and an element of denial over direct property pricing due to lack of transactions
6236170 the market may be in apocalyptic mood but there is some way out of here
6236171 there must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief theres too much confusion i cant get no relief
6236172 sentiment has worsened and there are more indicators of a downturn in activities with growth slowing the interest rate cost of money scenario unclear and inflationary concerns it will be surprising if this does not translate into lower activity across uk businesses
6236173 katherines strong experience in asset allocation her far sighted strategic approach and evident investment skills set her apart
6236174 katherine has played an integral role on the board since she joined us last year and has already made significant steps to modernise alliance trusts investment process in her current role the board and i are delighted that we have such a worthy successor to alan within our management team
6236175 alliance trust has an enviable reputation based upon its long term track record of global equity investment and i am fortunate to have the opportunity to reinforce this tradition
6236176 since arriving at alliance trust katherine has looked to improve the investment process and bring in external talent which bodes well for her coming time as chief executive
6236177 lend ers have had the opportunity to reprice their products higher and reap higher margins
6236178 but consumers continue to be saddled with high levels of personal debt with house prices expected to fall at least 10 per cent in 2008 with rising arrears repossessions and inflation the future of the uk lending markets looks bleak

6236236 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
6236237 theres nothing good about it inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the consumer price index for months to come the question is whether investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
6236238 i too am still against killing babies and allowing sodomites to marry anyone wishing to join those of us who believe in imprecatory prayer for divine justice are invited to join
6236239 oh i see so mccain isnt allowed to warn his supporters and other voters to consider your lack of experience when they vote why how is that off issue we are facing some pretty serious shit in this country having someone learning on the job trying to fix it all is a little risky get over yourself youre not entitled to have us think youre some paragon of experience just because you got the nomination

6236244 a big focus for this years convention is to actually engage people at home and to make people at home feel like they are part of the convention
6236245 and the way to do that is to accommodate the media
6236246 back then you had three networks and they pretty well dominated television
6236247 now you know what television is like with the proliferation of cable and other networks and then of course the internet came they came in a little bit in 1996 and have been growing ever since where we have a tremendous influx of bloggers this year
6236248 in the production side and theatrical side theyve had to plan ahead for that very reason because there can be a shortage of certain things like uplink trucks and other things that you need

6236252 morrisons 75 11 tesco 49 58 save a trolley load of cash at tesco
6236253 we are likely to settle on full year 2009 eps of around 400 cents which is unchanged following mondays in line results
6236254 this leaves the stock on a p e of 6 2 times in full year 2009 and a 28 per cent discount to our current dcf discounted cash flow of 2 113p we will revisit our overall sector view and stock selection soon but maintain bhp as the top pick
6236255 we believe the stock is undervalued and on the basis of our low end of the range forecasts is rated at only 3 8 x 2008 9 earnings based on a pre tax profit of 54 5m and eps of 47 2p
6236256 the shares are trading on cy08e and cy09e p e of 10 times and 8 5 times respectively in line with the wider consultancy average pe of 10 5 times and 9 3 times

6236259 i was standing outside for my few minutes outside at my cell a vietnamese guard came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his sandal on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together ill never forget that moment
6236260 as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible
6236261 gsm global system for mobile communications was designed from the first day to allow consumers to use any handset they want in the u s the mobile operators mobility in particular have made it clear you can do so im sure there will be subsidized handsets for a long time but more and more people are learning they can have exactly the cell phone they want regardless of whether the operator has decided to sell it
6236262 it has a much more sleek modern feel to it the treo in its day was a pretty cutting edge device in terms of form factor this puts palm back in the game competitively from a design standpoint its using the latest version of windows mobile 6 1 which is a rock solid os for mobile functionality it will appeal to people using it for business as well as consumers who may just be interested in it for personal use
6236263 it looks like a very very solid offering from palm it doesnt come a moment too soon it comes at time when they need to refresh the treo brand as the premium brand relative to the centro
6236264 its not clear if its enough to attract customers relative to competing offerings at some level its a battle between usability and sex appeal the pros improvements are well conceived and reflect a strong voice of the customer design orientation which should at least be enough to keep current aficionados loyal
6236265 this would be a much stronger launch if a carrier was already lined up but more and more companies are entering into this space and offering it as a choice for their customers
6236266 that is a concern for palm since they are the only gms carrier that has a full scale initiative to serve business users
6236267 the at amp t mobility group that focuses on the enterprise is heavily promoting the iphone however there are many obstacles with the iphone in enterprise it would be unfortunate if at amp t had rejected palm in favor of focusing on the iphone and blackberry
6236268 the only way to save the polar bear is to stop global warming and protect their sea ice habitat from melting away and the only way to do that is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
6236269 jeopardize the continued existence of polar bears or adversely modify their critical habitat
6236270 some bears will follow it and others will get stranded on land like some of them are now when the ice retreats in the summer those that follow the ice will survive and those that live on the land will have to adapt just like their ancestors did
6236271 do you even have data going back more than 50 years
6236272 if you want to address over hunting go to russia where they poach 200 polar bears a year
6236273 the problem pointed out in your own study is shrinking sea ice which is caused by carbon dioxide emissions

6236275 nothing beats an angry clown well maybe a sad clown

6236277 highly entertaining website its been awhile since ive actually laughed at something on the internet i am for sure looking forward to more the links are super organized and easy to navigate very nice job
6236278 this blog shows how to laugh when we forgot the importance of it your blog conveys a lot of message for our life thank good luck
6236279 we are fearful that job cuts are on the way at m amp s why else would they cut their existing policy if they did not intend to use it
6236280 why do people at the bottom get the sack on the cheap while the top bosses get large payouts even when they leave having messed up
6236281 i am happy with the draw because the reaction of the team in the last minute was good that is important capello said
6236282 in the first half we played good football with good style and created a lot of chances to score the team played together
6236283 the only thing i didnt like in the first half was when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot
6236284 the taliban caught us by surprise in an ambush that was extremely well prepared our men were not in a position to respond and fell in the first minutes
6236285 because it was here that the fight for terrorism is being fought
6236286 what you see is what you get so you have to get it first time

6236290 a friend in michael jackson post every plastic surgery experience he ever had halloween mask with five or six kids around him it was sick and hilarious ugly and beautiful pretty ugly i guess thats what im going for
6236291 a field with about 300 easter eggs in it like something out of a dream and then looking up and seeing all these little eyes staring at us through a window wondering what we were going to do with their eggs
6236292 it puts television not on an even footing with the internet but it could leapfrog it
6236293 the idea of writing an application once and having it play on all environments is incredible
6236294 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labour can she serve

6236297 que lo piense el gobierno federal si pretende repetir la consulta para imponer el proyecto
6236298 que lo piense el gobierno federal si pretende repetir la consulta para imponer el proyecto
6236299 esas declaraciones fueron una ofensa a los bienes comunales una ofensa a la autonom a de los pueblos a la libre decisi n que se tom en esa asamblea al parecer nos han declarado la guerra y si quieren guerra guerra van a tener
6236300 el tua advirti que los opositores tenemos la victoria ya que legalmente ganamos todos los juicios de nulidad

6236302 en su mayor a fueron contra el proyecto pues asegur que habr
6236303 se equivoca el gobierno federal si piensa que con repetir la consulta bastar para que se pueda iniciar la construcci n de la presa
6236304 nadie se puede apropiar de ella de una manera impune nadie la puede arrebatar la tierra la han tenido ustedes y esta lucha es justa es leg tima y por lo tanto es importante mantener la unidad de las organizaciones para que esta lucha logre los objetivos que se han trazado
6236305 vino a guerrero para resucitar a un muerto llamado proyecto la parota
6236306 la moneda no est en el aire la moneda ya call y el volado fue de nuestro lado y dec a no al proyecto la parota
6236307 i want you to write for this reader for this purpose using these materials in this order and here are a lot of details about each
6236308 the subdistrict of berwick street on the west side of soho was the most densely populated that made up greater london with 432 people to the acre
6236309 even with its skyscrapers manhattan today only houses around 100 per acre
6236310 due to mortgaging the house and a streak of tawdry material your wife assaulted you
6236311 if you replace the word assaulted with the words collided a cast iron skillet with you would be 100 correct
6236312 la fortaleza de un gobierno sobre todo despu s de una derrota est en su templanza para modificar el rumbo y adecuarlo a los nuevos tiempos en los que la negociaci n reemplaza a la imposici n a libro cerrado
6236313 el oficialismo est obligado ahora a hacer algo que no practic mucho desde que asumi negociar
6236314 si se consuma este acto de temor a la galer a de temor al desorden perpetrado por quienes quieren tener votos preferenciales a como d lugar a cualquier precio alg n d a se acordar el per que se fue el momento en que se interrumpi el cambio y se conden a cientos de miles a mantenerse en la miseria

6236319 man i think i have seen you in gay pornographics before not that i am gay oh no but i have heard of such things yes and you are doing quite well
6236320 its okay to be worried it is part of the job mon ami
6236321 i know they are cute but they must be killed or my family does not eat
6236322 the ones with the white fur the shiny blonde hair they are not bad for monkeys and they love the dildo pole especially the big black tip
6236323 but not like you eh oh no not at all i just look you you get in on the action youre a freak thats why i hired you
6236324 yes i know but it is not enough you must become what you hunt you must taste the meat you must know the meat

6236326 yes i have been hard on you mon ami for that i am truly sorry but it is the way do you not understand it is the way when a master teaches an apprentice

6236328 i would not have picked me dont be ridiculous i ran 57 56 and 57 seconds
6236329 it has been easily one of the worst seasons of my life and one of the best seasons at the same time
6236330 my blood cell count was low and that was why i was running so crappy i was glad just to be picked to be honest ive had so many problems
6236331 if i was on the outside looking in i probably would have said i shouldnt be selected
6236332 but the things people dont know behind the scenes are the things that the selectors know they knew what the doctors were seeing and they how long it would take
6236333 it means everything to me the moral of the story is never give up its not always rosy and thats the nature of athletics
6236334 the olympics comes around only once every four years so it is not an easy one to take
6236335 you want to play all your cards at the olympics but it didnt happen i am capable of doing it but you cant just say that you have to do it it is a hard one to take
6236336 la coalici n gobernante de democristianos y socialistas tiene que definir en chile sus procedimientos para elegir a un candidato y lo que yo he dicho es que creo que por ahora no estoy disponible ni quiero participar en una pr xima elecci n
6236337 he sido dirigente de la coalici n en un momento y no puedo ser prescindente prescindir de un acto importante para chile creo que no estar a de acuerdo y en consecuencia dije que voy a participar y apoyar a los candidatos de la coalici n
6236338 las encuestas son una foto un momento y creo que falta mucho para la elecci n presidencial las elecciones presidenciales se resuelven en la urna y no por encuestas en consecuencia siendo importante lo que dicen las encuestas no creo que sean un elemento definitorio

6236342 reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions
6236343 in every system of morality which i have hitherto met with i have always remarkd that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning and establishes the being of a god or makes observations concerning human affairs when all of a sudden i am surprizd to find that instead of the usual copulations of propositions is and is not i meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought or an ought not this change is imperceptible but is however of the last consequence for as this ought or ought not that expresses some new relation or affirmation tis necessary that it shoud be observd and explaind and at the same time that a reason should be given for what seems altogether inconceivable how this new relation can be a deduction from others which are entirely different from it
6236344 a principle which every one must have who understands anything that is is not a hypothesis and that which every one must know who knows anything
6236345 the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim
6236346 act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law
6236347 all that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good
6236348 this is the truth about the universe this is the way you ought to go
6236349 i am the truth and the way and the life
6236350 no man can reach absolute reality except through me try to retain your own life and you will be inevitably ruined give yourself away and you will be saved
6236351 if you are ashamed of me if when you hear this call you turn the other way i also will look the other way when i come again as god without disguise if anything whatever is keeping you from god and from me whatever it is throw it away if it is your eye pull it out if it is your hand cut it off if you put yourself first you will be last come to me everyone who is carrying a heavy load i will set that right your sins all of them are wiped out i can do that i am re birth i am life eat me drink me i am your food and finally do not be afraid i have overcome the whole universe

6236368 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 percent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events
6236369 these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6236370 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well capital positions are well above the minimum levels required by regulation
6236371 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low

6236448 the decree can be defined as original or creative at best
6236449 even the judge who issued the decree states that no infringing material is hosted on the pirate bay which provides just a tracker search engine
6236450 the judge tries to create a sort of contributory infringement accusation against the pirate bay
6236451 we will bring all our arguments before the tribunal and we are confident of the tribunals decision
6236452 it is clear that this decree has been strongly backed up by fimi the italian ifpi
6236453 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6236454 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6236455 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6236456 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6236457 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6236458 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6236465 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6236468 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6236469 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6236470 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6236471 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6236472 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6236473 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6236474 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6236475 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6236476 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6236477 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6236478 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care

6236480 wahler was arrested in new york and in seattle as a result of incidents not remotely related to this lawsuit

6236482 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programs since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6236483 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6236484 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6236485 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin
6236486 we are so often told about the disadvantages of large families that we have lost sight of the hidden advantages
6236487 a four person household uses half as much electricity per capita as a home for one the people who are messing up the planet are the single people living alone in swanky apartments someone needs to rebut these nonsensical stories
6236488 i had a meeting two days ago where we were talking about countries to tour and i said we have to go to australia
6236489 in the past it was very taboo for an artist to do something other than endorse a soft drink its like you were selling out if you were to go beyond that
6236490 but now its like the door is open and its ok to venture out into other things and beyond that i have to be passionate about it in order to do it
6236491 i love lingerie so when the idea came about with bruno i said now thats something
6236492 jane austen went on to write six of the greatest novels of her time
6236493 caprice set the gold standard for what a state charter school organization executive ought to be she redefined ccsa as a provider of a wide array of charter schools services that reduced schools costs and increased their efficiency at the same time she built the organization into a powerful engine for advocacy that always had seats at the table from sacramento to the city halls above all else though she made high quality the watchwords for public charter schools in california
6236494 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6236495 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6236496 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6236497 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6236498 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6236499 tu sei quella giusta quella che mi toglie il fiato con un semplice guardo quella che mi ama davvero e che fa tanto per me
6236500 si amo fatti dare la buonanotte al telefono senn non dormo
6236501 on all the fundamental issues that affect the lives and well being of our members the choice of candidates in this election is clear
6236502 more than 10 years ago our union undertook a comprehensive program of change in order to meet the needs of our members and the industry
6236503 it is time that our country takes the same steps to change direction and address the serious problems that affect all working men and women
6236504 we believe that barack obama recognizes the necessity for fundamental change in our nations policies
6236505 i eat far more than anyone would think possible because of my muscle mass

6236517 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6236518 control of the straits between the black and the mediterranean seas has long been a matter of keen interest to russia as well as other nations bordering the black sea historically russia has viewed such control as the sine qua non of its own sovereignty
6236519 there is nothing much to add to what mr bryza told washington reporters
6236520 we continue to look for possible sea routes and were working with turkey to facilitate the transport of humanitarian assistance in the fastest way under the rules of the montreux convention
6236521 as turkey we have the responsibility of maintaining regional peace in the event of such a request we evaluate and discuss these kinds of requests with related institutions with the utmost care before we make our decision those reports consist solely of rumors
6236522 the montreux convention is an international and multi party convention it is not up to turkey to make exceptions according to whether or not it is a humanitarian situation
6236523 the white house thinks that deploying a vessel such as the hospital ship usns comfort would showcase the bush administrations support for georgia and signal us concern that russia has sparked a humanitarian crisis in georgia the pentagon officials who both spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss internal policy deliberations said the move is unnecessary last week the us military sent a 12 member assessment team to determine how much humanitarian aid georgians need
6236524 moreover to send the comfort a destroyer or any other major naval vessel the bush administration would need to obtain permission from turkey under the montreux convention an international treaty that regulates naval passage in the black sea so far turkey which controls the bosporus and the dardanelles that link the mediterranean and the black seas has refused
6236525 if those figures were accurate there needs to be mass graves where are those graves
6236526 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad

6236530 the prime ministers silence is disrespectful to the public to parliament and to politics whoever is involved in bribery and corruption has no place in a public position
6236531 the bribery issue has become an ak party issue rather than one just related to aban di li
6236532 what needs to be done is to remove di lis immunity and put him in the judiciarys hands
6236533 if dark knight failed to perform way above expectations this would have been a decidedly down summer
6236534 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6236535 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6236536 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6236537 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6236538 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region the turkish prime ministers statement on the intention to start talks with armenia on this agenda could be welcomed
6236539 we are pleased that azerbaijan is taking a positive approach to our proposal
6236540 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6236541 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6236542 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6236543 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6236544 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6236545 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
6236546 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and alright were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest
6236547 but obviously we all had a deep yearning inside to get back to do this or it wouldnt have happened i just hope we dont split up again now cause it becomes a bit silly doesnt it
6236548 its gonna be towards the end of this year or the beginning of the new one
6236549 we did six dates earlier this year and it wasnt enough i want to visit all those places weve been where we know weve got fans and breathe life into these new songs from forth thats definitely on our list of things to do
6236550 all the people pardoned by sezer belonged to far leftist groups and were convicted of terror crimes some returned to the mountains to perpetrate terrorism on the turkish people some were later captured in armed clashes

6236552 i am honored to meet my brothers at such a meaningful and joyful festival today we are witnessing the gathering of more than 100 million people who come from sister countries at our festival it is a very nice idea to bring together different values belonging to different cultures i congratulate all civil society organizations that contributed to this festival
6236553 there are examples of such institutions in many countries embassies consulates and other representation offices will notify their home countries about successful scientists artists and people from other professions who are working abroad it is stated that a person worked on this or that and wants to return to the home country after that person returns an institution exists to welcome her him i wish there was a similar institution here in turkey where i can go and say i have done this and that so far i want to work here yet unfortunately there is no such institution
6236554 some were obviously laden most of them seemed to be empty riding high on their suspension
6236555 and there was no sign of armored vehicles or of artillery
6236556 three times medvedev has said they are starting the withdrawal and they have not
6236557 we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law
6236558 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
6236559 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
6236560 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
6236561 lake tuz has shrunk at an alarming rate from then on the water surface area of lake tuz decreased to 92 600 hectares in 1987
6236562 i clearly detected from the satellite images that the area of lake tuz decreased to 32 600 hectares in 2005 drought the over usage of water in the lake basin for irrigation and global warming have led to the loss of water in the lake some say the area lake tuz covers enlarges in the winter but this is not true because the shores of the lake become marshy ground in the winter the area the water covers no longer changes mud can be found on the shores of the lake in the winter not water
6236563 we have made great progress with the initial offering this year and i see great potential going forward as we bring context aware internet services to peoples pockets these changes will strengthen our offerings and enable us to accelerate the delivery of new internet experiences to market

6236587 a really good idea i heard once was this for a week or two before you leave keep track of everything you use one way to do this is to get a big box and anytime you use something it goes in the box then take only the box to school
6236588 absolutely do not pull an all nighter the night before you show up no way in hell

6236591 we were all the best in high school you wont be the best at olin dont sweat it
6236592 dont compare yourself to your classmates everyone here is smart ultimately your work ethic and attitude will matter more than smarts
6236593 ask for help on assignments sooner rather than later everyone else is probably just as confused as you are
6236594 there are tutors for pretty much everything theyre all paid to help you so dont be shy about asking for help
6236595 explore sleep play ask for help when you need it

6236600 its never too late to come out of your room and start making friends even though it may seem like everyone has already found a bff i promise that someone at olin would love to include you
6236601 hang out in east hall talk to upperclassmen theyre excited to meet you
6236602 remember that if you choose to date anyone at olin and do there are only 300 other students here tread softly and leave on good terms
6236603 dont join every club you see but keep in mind that most clubs have almost zero commitment and let you in on some optional fun activities once in a while japanese club tea club cheese club as examples
6236604 in the next four years you will have to move every few months you will know exactly how many rubbermaid bins of stuff you own you will routinely hit the baggage limit if you go by plane you will try to cram
6236605 live it up but dont be stupid its easy to go too far so watch out
6236606 be flexible be persistent live in the moment get outside and find a way to de stress
6236607 sure there are alternatives but having your own car gives you unmatched freedom
6236608 an equal number of tshirts and pairs of underwear with an appropriately scaled quantity of pants
6236609 you probably dont need that extra desktop computer unless you like to use it as a dedicated machine for something like a gaming pc or a server its just going to be a gather dust the same goes for printers there are laser printers all over campus
6236610 a desktop computer seems like a great idea and in certain cases it can be very valuable but it also ties you to your dorm room
6236611 we are so happy that we have made the people of georgia proud with this win after all our troubles back home wales are not a small footballing nation and to win is the best day of my life
6236612 its a big result for the country and our new manager hector cuper in his first match because he has now seen the players and will be able to put them in their best positions
6236613 we will expect a similar game with ireland as we got from wales they play with a similar style of play and system to the rest of the british isles

6236617 a space to develop a toolkit which can be used by any organisation to determine their approach to web 2 0 and social media tools
6236618 a while back my father broke the lcd so the machine was sitting in a closet ever since
6236619 silverback makes it easy quick and cheap for everyone to perform guerilla usability tests with no setup and no expense using hardware already in your mac
6236620 reflect in this particular instance means acknowledgement a step on from simply listening it means identifying network s activities conversations or communities of interest then raising their profile by giving them recognition
6236621 in the social media space and with all the noise going on in government about creating blogs and wikis i think the value of using social media tools to observe the conversations taking place around us is rather overlooked
6236622 i spoke about the mylifemyid website that had been set up for 16 to 25 year olds to have a little explore around the feelings over personal identity cards
6236623 at virtual surveys we are currently engaged in what we feel could be the most exciting online research project currently taking place in the uk
6236624 an interesting report into the blockers behind the adoption of social media in government is quoted as flagging up it as one of those key blockers
6236625 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6236626 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6236627 in many instances mom or dad says see your school nurse
6236628 we suction traechs we do gastrastemy tube feeding we do cauterizations we do a lot of basic treatments that are basic in the medical community
6236629 invad an las radios los programas de televisi n y las tiendas de discos
6236630 he took that tumble a few weeks ago and since then hes been sharper than hes been all year
6236631 hes got tons of back class and its really starting to show through now and if he can get to within striking distance and whip off another of those 28 second final panels it could be all over
6236632 rapid access to a patients medical history is improving decision making which is one of the most important reasons to make the investment in information technology
6236633 after 11 years of a labour government most young people are still failing to achieve five good gcses including maths and english if we are going to have a world class education system we must do more to promote educational achievement especially among the most disadvantaged children
6236634 there is a grave danger that academic study is being reserved for the high performers which will widen socio economic divides
6236635 if this were to escalate there is a very real possibility of a reversion to a system akin to the grammar secondary modern divide though arguably in less meritocratic a form
6236636 that a purportedly equalising labour government should be the architect of such a divide would be tragic irony significantly though it is all too apparent that it is the system which has lost interest in the pupils largely because they run the risk of not delivering the right a to c performance through academic gcses
6236637 the achievement gap between children from deprived backgrounds and the more affluent is closing just because a pupil is on free school meals does not mean they are destined to fail at school many schools in the most deprived areas are achieving excellent gcse results
6236638 it is ridiculous to suggest that performance tables are designed to meet government targets for example two years ago we deliberately changed the tables to include achievement in english and maths this brought about a big decline in reported performance but we made this change because it best served the needs of pupils parents and employers
6236639 in january the then culture secretary categorically promised the commons there would be no more lottery raids to pay for their olympics budget miscalculations
6236640 six months later that promise has been torn up every time the lottery is raided less money goes into grassroots sport yet this is the only way we will secure a legacy for everyone from the 2012 olympics
6236641 funding for our athletes in athens was primarily lottery money in beijing both lottery and exchequer
6236642 for london the package will be lottery exchequer and business
6236643 following our successes in beijing we have great ambitions for our athletes in 2012 and are determined to make sure that investment is in place
6236644 can gordon brown not see there is something fundamentally short sighted in funding the british team by raiding the money going to local and community sports clubs
6236645 if the government had started raising this money earlier our athletes could have had the funding certainty they need without raiding grassroots sports
6236646 locking both low income pupils and vocational education into second class status
6236647 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6236648 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses
6236649 there are many paths to success including vocational as well as academic options indeed 85 per cent of employers would encourage young people to take vocational qualifications

6236655 no one has been able to tell me whether rebecca died as a result of the collision or because of the delay in getting her to hospital
6236656 im no expert but i can say 42 minutes is totally unacceptable for an injury of that nature
6236657 i can never stop thinking what might have happened if they had got to her quickly it might have made no difference or it might have made all the difference in the world
6236658 we recognise there were serious failings in our service at the time of this incident

6236669 the difference isnt subtle and we named it daylite for a reason its like bringing a beam of daylight to the job its powered by duracell batteries but its another example of how the company is bringing more than battery innovation to the market

6236672 a petrol tank with about 1000 litres of petrol caught fire
6236673 the concern everyone had was trying to stop the fire spreading to the nearby buildings
6236674 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark
6236675 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43bn
6236676 easily reach 50bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the treasury
6236677 these dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control one test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
6236678 gordon brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence
6236679 theres little political content no credit crunch its personal stories
6236680 people have not gone for wider things the world situation to provide a lot of material
6236681 i live in these times so that is my day to day
6236682 how people seem so unhappy in their relationship the difficulty of settling on anything and the problem of hype in modern times
6236683 im dazed and confused i feel a little bit like im drunk and everyone is walking round me very fast
6236684 there are a lot of other very very good young women out there now and i think thats a great step forward
6236685 its not about being taught fixed positions postures in which to hold the body and it isnt manipulation like say physiotherapy or massage
6236686 the goal of at is to set up the right circumstances under which the body can function as it was meant to
6236687 youre learning the tools you need to use your body more effectively and efficiently and getting to know your patterns and habits so you can let go of the bad ones the hands on element is important because it helps you feel how a movement can be different thats difficult to do from a book
6236688 definitely by the time people walk through the door they are usually willing to change something
6236689 theyve been through the my backs not working can you fix it mindset and tried a lot of other things so by the time they come to me they are more open to change
6236690 with physiotherapy you can receive some treatment and be shown all the exercises you need to do in say six sessions
6236691 we dont diagnose and we dont treat our role comes after treatment and any good teacher will ideally work one to one in conjunction with the clients medical practitioner
6236692 pilates is brilliant for backs because it works the spine through all its planes of movement
6236693 extension flexion rotation and side flexion as well as teaching good body awareness and use improving breathing and posture
6236694 chiropractic is wrongly pereceived to be simply a manipulative technique thats just like saying dentists only do fillings
6236695 its actually a complete package of care which could involve everything from hands on treatment to postural assessment and stretching
6236696 symptoms are the last thing to come and the first thing to go so we tend to blame the problem on the last action we did rather than looking at the bigger picture
6236697 when a patient walks in yes i want to alleviate their pain but i also want to look at its cause and the aggravating factors because without addressing these the problem will return
6236698 the role of the osteopath is to help the individual manage themselves in ways that will optimise their recovery
6236699 treatment will likely involve a combination of hands on treatment movement re education and exercises to practise at home as well as the development of coping strategies
6236700 just how fine a line the bank of england is having to tread
6236701 the majority of mpc members thought the current weakness in the economy and the resulting spare capacity was enough to bear down on inflation without the need for an increase in the interest rate
6236702 item club still believes that interest rates will stay on hold during the summer months but the possibility of a cut in november seems increasingly likely
6236703 our central view remains that we will see the first rate cut in early 2009 with an outside chance of a cut before christmas if it becomes clear that inflation is starting to turn the corner
6236704 if you ask people what they carry on adventures or on the job besides a multi tool or knife most of them mention a light weve actually been making some of our sheaths to accommodate a keychain flashlight for years now
6236705 but we wanted to do something with it no one else had take the most popular sizes give them output never before seen in that size and all for a price point that really didnt exist
6236706 we received thousands of entries but these photographs really stood out in each of their respective categories
6236707 in todays on the go society consumers especially photographers are looking for portable power solutions to run their high tech devices
6236708 energizer ultimate lithium offers overall greater reliability allowing photographers and high tech users to get the maximum use out of their equipment
6236709 we are making a significant investment to move the brite strike brand forward

6236740 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6236741 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6236742 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6236743 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info

6236827 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
6236828 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
6236829 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
6236830 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
6236831 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced

6236836 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6236837 economic dynamic could be somewhat subdued in the coming months noticeable reductions in consumer confidence and a collapse in the sentiment of retailers dont show any signs of pickup in the coming months improvement should be expected when inflation falls notably
6236838 the upside risk to inflation in the short term had probably eased a little
6236839 inflation expectations for 2008 in the us at 3 8 are clearly higher than the price increases for 2007 2 8 also in western europe inflation expectations for 2008 at now 3 5 are considerably above inflation registered for 2007 2 1 a similar picture was determined for asia where inflation expectations for 2008 are nearly three percentage points higher than price increases in 2007 5 3 vis vis 2 4 in 2007
6236840 now is a good time to be patient because i do think we will see better news on the inflation front
6236841 but i dont think the problem with fannie and freddie is just confined to banks that happen to hold their preferred stock

6236850 the government has been engaging constructively at eu level for more widespread application of reduced vat rates to energy saving and energy efficient products
6236851 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long lifecycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6236852 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
6236853 currently a lot of people cannot justify spending a huge amount on a product just because it lasts longer
6236854 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centred on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
6236855 governments and businesses around the world will make substantial investments in identity management infrastructures over the next few years

6236906 barack obama has been a very strong champion of equal pay for equal work senator mccain over and over again has opposed the opportunity for pay equity bills to move through congress
6236907 theres no question that women in michigan and kansas all over this country are going to be critical voters in this election

6236930 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6236931 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6236932 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag

6236939 anfang der wochen wurden in afghanistan zehn franz sische soldaten get tet die lage am hindukusch hat sich zugespitzt sind die deutschen soldaten sicher
6236940 hintergrund ist dass die terroristischen aktivit ten immer st rker von pakistan auf afghanistan ausstrahlen und die taliban dort ihr aufmarsch und r ckzugsgebiet haben das bereitet mir gro e sorgen vor allem mit blick auf die grenze afghanistan pakistan dort gehen in bestimmten regionen t glich 60 000 menschen unkontrolliert ber die grenze
6236941 es zeichnet sich ab dass die usa ihren kampf gegen den internationalen terrorismus deshalb nach pakistan verlagern wollen ziehen sie dabei mit
6236942 wir m ssen pakistans grenzen respektieren aber entschieden auf eine l sung des grenzproblems dringen pakistan muss den anti terror kampf st rker unterst tzen
6236943 halten sie einen isaf einsatz in pakistan f r notwendig
6236944 das steht nicht zur diskussion aber abgesehen davon ginge das nicht ohne zustimmung pakistans und ein mandat der vereinten nationen
6236945 unterst tzen sie den einsatz von awacs aufkl rungsflugzeugen ber afghanistan
6236946 erwarten sie widerstand im bundestag f r ein neues isaf mandat
6236947 ich hoffe dass wir ber die mehrheit der gro en koalition hinaus daf r zustimmung finden dem letzten isaf mandat haben auch gr ne und fdp abgeordnete zugestimmt

6237006 the links between the united irishmen and napoleons france led to panic among the british
6237007 they were afraid of a french invasion in much the same way as britain was in fear of a nazi invasion in 1940 martello towers were constructed all around ireland and britain to repulse this feared attack
6237008 in spite of the huge effort to build this defensive network the towers were never actually used
6237009 the towers were not built until 1812 by that time the threat of invasion by the french had all but disappeared after their defeat at trafalgar in 1807

6237075 this does not include soft health travel such as spa treatments and health checks
6237076 it is critical that australia understands and caters for these trends and like other countries we need to recognise that our ageing domestic population and narrowing tax base will place increasing strain on our health system
6237077 atec believes we can do an education and build capacity into our private health system by tapping into export markets last year education became the primary reason for travel to australia
6237078 typically new zealand has stolen a march on us with their government backing private sector efforts to enter global travel markets by contrast australian governments of both shades have been slow to realise the potential benefits and implications

6237114 she is so hot i always would have thought she was out of my league theres a lot guys who are better looking than i am but so many of them are too shy or dont have a good personality girls are more attracted to personality than looks

6237118 although the travel industry in china encountered many difficulties during the second quarter of 2008 after the sichuan earthquake ctrip delivered solid revenue and earnings growth
6237119 so weve seen the market has slowed down during the olympics
6237120 but our expectation is in the fourth quarter all the business and travel volume will be back to normal
6237121 this acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position
6237122 this is what airasia x is about providing affordable international travel for everyone our regular daily services between melbourne and kuala lumpur during the peak period at christmas will open up the skies at a time when many people have holidays and are seeking cost effective and exciting vacations in new locations
6237123 the new flights servicing kuala lumpur and melbourne were the result of a collaborative effort between the victorian government airasia x and industry
6237124 the fact that melbourne airport is curfew free gives airasia x the flexibility to operate a full outbound and inbound service as required
6237125 we estimate that more than 60 per cent of airasia x passengers to melbourne will be first time visitors based on our gold coast experience which will contribute significantly to tourism growth allowing airasia x the opportunity to open up new market segments from malaysia with its low fares
6237126 we are very excited about the melbourne launch and confident this route will perform very well as it is one of the most requested australian destinations from our guests
6237127 kuala lumpur melbourne is an under served route with crazy fuel surcharges that full service carriers are charging there is definitely a huge opportunity for airasia x to serve and tap particularly the leisure education and family travel markets
6237128 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often
6237129 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multi colour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
6237130 with our expanding australian network to melbourne gold coast and perth airasia is committed and poised to position malaysia as asias biggest low cost hub
6237131 so why is the riaa asking for 756 per downloaded song
6237132 with the furor over the impending rate hike for internet radio stations wouldnt a good solution be for streaming internet stations to simply not play riaa affiliated labels music and focus on independent artists
6237133 global theft of sound recordings cost the u s economy 12 5 billion in lost revenue and more than 71 000 jobs and 2 billion in wages to u s workers
6237134 we need more protection from terrorists please take more freedom away from us like you did with the first patriot act

6237138 we are delighted to work in partnership with ebay on this project and believe that ebays market footprint and its very special association with ebay members will in combination with our supply arrangements and leading edge technology and service provide a great customer experience and substantially propel online hotel sales in the australian market
6237139 if queenstown didnt exist someone would have to invent it with a cinematic background of mountains and lakes you actually have seen in the movies and a what can we think of next array of adventure activities its little wonder that the south islands premier tourist town tops many travellers kiwi itineraries
6237140 the message that you dont have to be an extreme adventurer to enjoy your time in queenstown is an important one and a key part of our identity thats successfully hitting home with many visitors
6237141 queenstown does have the reputation as the adventure capital of the world but we are also a sophisticated and cosmopolitan resort with excellent food and wine day spas and golf courses
6237142 the popularity of river cruising has seen the emergence of many repeat travellers looking for new options
6237143 mark brings a wealth of experience to hilton and we look forward to welcoming him to our team he is joining hilton at what is a very exciting time in the company
6237144 i would like to thank steve for his many years of service to both hilton and the hospitality industry and wish him well for his retirement
6237145 visitor nights are at record levels largely because of the focus that grand pacific drive has given our marketing
6237146 in fact the region has defied the national trend by registering a 15 per cent hike in domestic day visitors and 10 per cent more domestic overnight stays for the year to march according to just released tourism nsw data
6237147 and were looking down the barrel of another record summer as sydneysiders spooked by rising petrol prices look for closer to home breaks this holiday high season
6237148 giving it a big tick was really a no brainer and the whole concept just took off especially when the federal government got behind it with a 499 700 australian tourism development program grant
6237149 the money helped us to run a marketing and pr campaign to promote grand pacific drive around australia and internationally and install a series of very effective directional and interpretive signs to highlight the drive on the southern freeway out of sydney
6237150 since the bridge opened weve gained six new hotels as well as the stunning new illawarra fly tree top walk near robertson a new apt day tour out of sydney several exciting new thrill rides at jamberoo action park now the largest theme park in nsw and enthusiastic engagement by the local industry and tourism wholesalers who are now offering local holiday packages in 14 overseas markets
6237151 cooperation at a local government level has never been stronger with councils right along grand pacific drive agreeing to a finely tuned blueprint that we believe is setting new standards for co involvement
6237152 looking back at our achievements over the past 25 years i am extremely proud that our company is now recognised as australias longest established and most awarded cruise line
6237153 this cruise is our opportunity to say thank you to all our loyal guests many of whom have travelled with us numerous times over the last 25 years
6237154 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ v 2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god v 3 and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience v 4 and patience experience and experience hope v 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us v 6 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly v 7 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die v 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us v 9 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him v 10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life v 11 and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement
6237155 i love you and i want to have fellowship with you
6237156 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus our lord

6237173 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6237174 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6237175 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6237176 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info
6237177 templates and markup are now in discussion on public mailing lists but we believe we are pretty close
6237178 the state legislature charged hca in 2005 and 2007 with the responsibility to improve information sharing for washingtons health care communities
6237179 today no one has access to their complete health information parts of which are stored at multiple locations where care is provided it is difficult for patients or medical personnel to easily see the entirety of a patients medical information clearly this is needed to provide the best care
6237180 this project will give us the opportunity to expand on several years of experience in whatcom county with the shared care plan personal health record
6237181 consumers accessing and documenting their own health information and sharing it with their doctors helps physicians and patients to work together for better outcomes we need these pilots to learn more about the benefits and any possible pitfalls from this consumer enabling approach this is an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between patient and physician
6237182 inhs connects 38 hospitals multiple reference laboratories emergency services regional imaging centers and physicians with more than 2 8 million health records
6237183 making health information available online to patients families caregivers and health consumers is a critical step toward a more streamlined health care system
6237184 while a growing number of our health care providers are using electronic medical records we have a very small number of patients that have ready access to their personal health information in an electronic format let alone in a way that can be proactively used with their doctor
6237185 regional organizations of all kinds in chelan douglas grant and okanogan counties will work with us to build a robust health record bank that facilitates greater participation by consumers in their health care

6237203 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6237204 i know from personal experience that life really does come at you fast i went from being an unknown singer to appearing before of millions of people as an american idol contestant now i am doing a commercial for nationwide insurance im excited to see what happens next in my career
6237205 we know from watching american idol that sanjaya appeals to many audiences
6237206 we knew that because of his south asian heritage and a great personal life comes at you fast story sanjaya was a good fit we found out that there is a lot of public interest in seeing the ad so we made it available online
6237207 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6237208 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6237209 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6237210 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations

6237213 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones were no more than a show
6237214 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6237215 the idea of demonstration is that you are hoping to resolve issues not to demonstrate for the sake of demonstrating we are pleased that issues have been resolved through dialogue and communication this is how we do it in chinese culture
6237216 we want everyone to express their opinion everyone has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6237217 the olympics are about sport we are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the olympics is a catalyst for development here that catalytic effect is happening but the olympics are not a panacea for all ills
6237218 relationships with actual car parts or manufactures are very important i think to
6237219 looks like carls going to be the guy to beat
6237220 realistically i think we probably need to finish in the top 10 we need to average about an eighth place finish or better through the rest of the year to do it so whatever that takes if that means you win one week and finish 13th the next im not going to say that i need to finish in the top 10 every week basically we need to average an eighth place finish or so and i think we can do it
6237221 i guess the tangle web that we weave smiles im glad i can answer this question now when theres like some time to answer because this is a long answer so bare with me i think everything thats happened specifically over the last two or three days and whats happened with the gibbs team is a reflection of decisions made two years ago and were just now seeing consequences of it now the toyotas have had the best motor now for two years and it came down to a matter that you know they had new teams new drivers and they just werent able to showcase it and with the package that we had without the plate it didnt really because we had more power than we could use i think if you ask most racers theyll tell you that when you have more power than you can use then its not a big deal well kind of going with that mindset and seeing how chevrolet basically dominated last season in both the nationwide series and the cup series it was very hard for nascar to look at toyotas advantage and level it out when they werent winning the reality of it was that they still had a better package and the fact that we put the plate on just accentuated that along with the fact that their teams got stronger and so on and so forth so then youre left in a situation where you have a manufacturer which has built an engine that is just designed superior to ours and there was really nothing that nascar could do they didnt have an old motor to go back to they couldnt take away the toyota motor they didnt have a motor to go back to and chevrolet saw that and built the r 07 the r 07 is chevrolets answer to toyota engine and fords got their answer that their working on dodge has their answer to it that theyre working on so then it comes down to all right well they have an advantage horsepower wise i hear from the fans all the time well why dont you guys go to work well we did we did go to work to fix it but the piece thats sitting on the table makes no sense to bring out ill give nascar the credit that when they came up with the taper rule to reduce the toyotas and kind of looking at their thinking and my view of it is that i think there is a financial cold war of a sense in the series in the sport and by not allowing chevrolet to have their new engine theyre not necessarily prolonging but trying to lessen that affect if we were given the new engine tomorrow wed be right there with the toyota we could compete with them heads up we could race with them i think we could beat em but to do that might make sense for a team like jr motorsports thats affiliated with hendrick but it makes zero sense for a team like jay robinson racing or johnny davis because you just kill those teams you played right into the hands of those that have the finances and we need those teams we need drivers like kertus davis we need those guys so it was a tough decision and the decision to put the plate on to reduce the toyotas was one that i didnt even feel very good about because i hate to see that happen and i understand 100 percent what gibbs went through and why they would be disappointed and why they would the things that they did and ill be honest i might have done the same things if i was them if i was in their shoes im going to say that i probably wouldve and thats really unfortunate but its two years in the making and were just now seeing the decision that was done two years ago has cast i feel bad for em but it doesnt make it right but i can certainly understand why they did what they did
6237222 its like watching someone close to you get hurt and then hurting the person that hurt them youre still not right two wrongs dont make a right i think the frustration on the team side or the team side other than gibbs you know everyone across the board why we are so upset about this so angry about this is weve been told now for six straight months from the media from nascar from anyone that theyre just better than us were losing races cause theyre just better than us denny hamlin is just better than i am kyle busch is just better than you are brad his crew chief is better than your team their shock guy is better than your team and then you go and you see something like this and you go wait a minute i started to believe it i started to get beat down like everyone else did that you know what maybe joe gibbs is just better that what weve got maybe denny hamlin is just that much better than i am and then you see something like this and you go wait a minute what was i thinking i can run with these guys and ive been beat up now for 12 months or six months or whatever its been for no reason and thats very sad i think from a penalty status the biggest thing that sets out in my mind is what they did they did not cheat in that race at michigan in my opinion a hundred percent they did not cheat in that race at michigan but what they did was even worse than that they attempted to cheat in the next two seasons by doing what they did on that dynojet its worse than cheating in that one race they attempted to cheat for the next whatever session that was going to be before the next dyno session before nascar could prove it its almost like what they did was just worse than even cheating in that one race i almost wish they would have cheated in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done so thats what makes it even worse you know as far as whats right and whats justified in the sport and all that im glad i dont have to make that decision i really am im glad i dont have to make that decision because the ones that really got hurt the worst its not going to be brad keselowski its not going to be jr motorsports or dale earnhardt jr its just got egg thrown in their face and they dont deserve that in a way they stuck up for the toyotas for two years by not putting the smaller spacer on when they had more power they stuck up for em and when the finally started seeing the light of day and just evened it out they didnt even put them behind they just evened em out because if you look at the numbers they still had more horsepower with the smaller plate than we did at michigan after all the complaining that i heard from brian vickers they still had more power than we did like come on guys thats my soapbox laughter
6237223 no not surprised at all i think theres the potential that whatever they did with the magnets was done before i dont believe that theres just the potential i also know how strong that company is and they are strong i think they were ready for this decision and they had some stuff prepared to combat it not really surprised no i was surprised that they would go to the measure that they would go to i understand it i cant say that strongly enough i understand why they did what they did and if i was in the shoes i might have done the same right or wrong theres a lot of emotions that i have over this the seven stages of acceptance or whatever and one of them is just sympathy i really feel bad for em because they way this all worked out for them they dont deserve the discredit that theyre going to get for this but it is what it is
6237224 hes good hes really talented he could probably make it if there was one team youd want to do it with thatd be it the 20 team with greg zipadelli there is a risk but its a small one i think hell do good
6237225 well its very obvious like i said when i go home and i travel down a road that used to have traffic jams every day and theres no traffic on it anymore its like where did everybody go the last one out turns the lights off theres nobody there its kind of scary its really scary its not very cool the economy is what it is a few racers aint going to change it but what we can do to support american manufacturers were going to do
6237226 i thought you had became a man whore gt gt

6237280 this could prompt further industry consolidation although some smaller operations bucked the trend this year scale is very definitely a factor behind profitable financial performance and with the credit crunch extending into 2008 smaller wineries may find themselves wrestling a little harder for their capital
6237281 demand for our wines remains strong and so long as the industry does not fall into an oversupply trap there was a great opportunity to grow exports further

6237326 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6237327 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6237328 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6237329 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6237330 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates

6237414 you said youd always tell me the truth i have a serious question is heaven real
6237415 i had to remember do not give up on yourself mentally at least if youre mentally able to stay on top of it you never know what you can do

6237417 as vms move across subnets just the movements of the vms can cause headaches around keeping track of where resources are and who has access to them
6237418 it is as much about change control as change management the network manager has to make sure the network teams have visibility into the movement of applications and servers network managers have to develop more effective ways of tracking the location of applications than was required with physical servers
6237419 as we make this infrastructure more dynamic it becomes more challenging
6237420 having some pieces of software that reach down and automate this is a direct challenge not just in terms of infrastructure but in terms of the organization that manages it virtualization 1 0 was about consolidating multiple servers into one box virtualization 2 0 is around orchestrating multiple boxes into that virtual layer and a whole bunch of virtualized functions get consolidated into that layer
6237421 if i have a port flopping issue where the interface is going down i need to know what applications are behind the switch when you bring virtualization into the mix it becomes harder to figure out now it is not just the physical server at the other end of the port it is the physical server and the 10 vms running on that port there is no spreadsheet in the world that can keep that up to date they need a way to discover that topology in real time
6237422 virtualization is even further blurring the lines between the network and the server
6237423 a lot of times application developers will configure these virtual network devices without knowing a lot about networking and then the network guys will have to come in and troubleshoot the problem
6237424 a lot of times the server administrators dont understand vlans and vlan trunking protocol

6237428 opening night will be a memorable and historic evening at the us open with the celebration of the open era
6237429 we look forward to honoring the tournaments rich history with some of the games greatest champions ever to play the game

6237432 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6237433 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future
6237434 we have achieved a lot over the past three and a half years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6237435 the organisation is in better financial health than ever before and i am also delighted to have seen the recent launch of the respect programme which is very important to me
6237436 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success while i also believe the plans for the national football centre will benefit english football in the long term

6237440 for many reasons mainly concerning my age health and decreasing energy levels i have taken the decision to stand down as mp for keighley at the next general election
6237441 my campaigns on behalf of some of our most vulnerable people are coming to fruition the forced marriage civil protection act comes into effect in september
6237442 of course none of us are aware of when the next election will be called but my work and that of my office will continue on behalf of constituents until then
6237443 i will also be doing all i can to help promote whoever is selected as labours parliamentary candidate for the next election illustrating the difference labour has made for the keighley constituency to ensure it continues to have a labour mp after the next election
6237444 ann cryer has been a distinguished servant of the people of keighley for many years first assisting her late husband bob cryer who represented the seat between 1974 and 1983 and then as the labour mp for the seat since 1997
6237445 she knows every inch of her constituency and her understanding of its communities is second to none

6237447 the census has been around for 200 years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services
6237448 we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute public money but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools

6237450 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6237451 it really demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife
6237452 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken 100 years to get from the balustrade to the house were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6237453 discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6237454 camping is one of the easiest ways to experience wildlife because youre outside all the time and thats where the wildlife is
6237455 you can get to see the most fantastic bits of our countryside i recently camped overlooking st davids bay in wales and choughs birds that are rare in the uk were just flying round the campsite and there were seals dolphins and porpoises off the coast its eye opening to have animals around you and share their space
6237456 the great thing about camping is that its an excuse to get out into the countryside and see some wildlife most of us live in towns and cities and dont get to see little creatures wandering around on our daily commute to work
6237457 my most memorable wildlife camping moment was when a badger decided to go for a walk underneath our tent i dont know if we had pitched over its set or whether it was just foraging but it was a shock to see a moving lump in the floor of the tent
6237458 try to find camping places that are really remote and not oversubscribed the fewer people around the more chance youve got of spotting wildlife
6237459 the characters in particular are really expressive and seem to all be living their own life within the game also thanks to the day night cycle pretty enjoyable gameplay good tempo humor is often indecent seems like the music is pretty good too

6237461 if you arent doing anything wrong what do you have to hide
6237462 if im not doing anything wrong then you have no cause to watch me
6237463 because the government gets to define whats wrong and they keep changing the definition
6237464 if one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man i would find something in them to have him hanged

6237475 poverty that creates fertile ground for drug trafficking it is poverty that sends so many legal and illegal immigrants over u s borders poverty cannot be detained by walls
6237476 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6237477 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6237478 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6237479 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
6237480 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
6237481 anyone thinking about marrying this defendant would be well advised to consult her rap sheet before taking the plunge

6237485 a lot of my friends talk to me about these issues but not a lot of people do something about it
6237486 i think its really important for young people to get involved
6237487 thats the key here you have to have a comprehensive plan that looks at everything so we become less dependent on foreign oil
6237488 we get nothing out of the plan to drill offshore
6237489 seven hundred thirty of his constituents have signed a petition that we need to get away from using oil we gotta do something better than the same old stuff
6237490 cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
6237491 its important to me because the state of economy as well as national security hinge on these very issues
6237492 a new breed of mental health professionals or eco therapists has popped up on the left coast you might expect them to be weirdos preying on the equally wacko and forlorn aura cleansers 2 0 but most are standard grade therapists whove found a specialty that makes perfect sense in todays world
6237493 earth in the balance first we have to put our mood in the balance and few bay area residents find that easy
6237494 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6237495 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6237496 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6237497 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6237498 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6237499 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6237500 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6237501 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keep on skyrocketing
6237502 ive heard a rumor that youre going to pick a pro life vp is that true
6237503 not talking about the process of the vice presidential situation
6237504 i believe that life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6237505 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6237506 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6237507 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6237508 while john mccain wants to give big corporations and oil companies hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks hes offering nothing to 100 million americans
6237509 obama will provide a 1 000 tax break for 95 of workers and their families and not raise taxes on families making less the 250 000 a year
6237510 americas business taxes are the second highest in the world and that is driving american jobs overseas said mccain spokesman tucker bounds
6237511 so while american families are hurting and jobs are becoming scarce barack obama is pushing for billions in higher taxes its a recipe for economic disaster
6237512 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6237513 yet again john mccain makes another false low road attack while hes offering just more of the same bush economics that have failed us for eight years
6237514 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play

6237516 the tanker contract which could eventually grow to 100 billion to build a fleet of 179 refueling planes is one of the most lucrative ever awarded by the pentagon
6237517 lets get this straight john mccain led the charge to uncover the biggest boondoggle in pentagon history saved the taxpayers over 6 billion helped send corrupt execs and government officials to jail and the democrats say hes the bad guy its absurd apparently to barack obama and the democrats corruption is ok so long as it helps them politically thats not change we can believe in
6237518 open shop or right to work laws laws interfere with freedom to contract
6237519 i regard openshop laws as an interference in private law
6237520 the dncs attack on mccain speaks volumes to the bipartisan gut checking in favor of military waste that has led us to squander trillions of taxpayer dollars since 9 11
6237521 the first step in a fascist movement is the combination under an energetic leader of a number of men who possess more than the average share of leisure brutality and stupidity the next step is to fascinate fools and muzzle the intelligent by emotional excitement on the one hand and terrorism on the other
6237522 no one here will believe this but is actually not far from what i have said here many times
6237523 up until that point in time we would say that there was not sufficient oversight
6237524 we still point out concerns and areas where we think there should be further enhancements
6237525 the military budget is a massive wealth transfer program from ordinary taxpayers to major corporations and it has proven easy over the years to wrap this transfer in red white and blue and have a major portion of the american people burst out in a rousing chorus of the national anthem and applaud their own mugging
6237526 israel will attack iran before new us president sworn in john bolton predicts
6237527 sources differ but the majority claim that scotts character was based on lemay

6237529 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed

6237534 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6237535 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6237536 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6237537 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6237538 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6237539 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6237540 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6237541 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6237542 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6237543 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6237544 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6237545 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6237546 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6237547 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6237548 i peaked in here and the air conditioner was out
6237549 way too elaborate for a first year relief pitcher but still really spiffy looking
6237550 aww hunter youre so cute why youre one of my babies youre just one of my children
6237551 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6237552 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6237553 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6237554 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6237555 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6237556 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6237557 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6237558 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6237559 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6237560 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6237561 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6237562 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6237563 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6237564 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6237565 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6237566 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6237567 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6237568 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6237569 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6237570 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6237571 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6237572 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6237573 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6237574 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6237575 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6237576 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6237577 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6237578 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6237579 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6237580 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6237581 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6237582 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6237583 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6237584 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6237585 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6237586 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6237587 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6237588 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6237589 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6237590 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6237591 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6237592 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6237593 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6237594 we are excited to have sandy join our great team of dedicated health care professionals and we feel confident she is the ideal candidate to help us carry out our vitally important mission in the years to come
6237595 amassed a tremendous breadth of experience in virtually every area of strategic clinical and operational leadership
6237596 instrumental in leading efforts to improve patient satisfaction to establish a new mission statement to develop system wide quality indicators and a quality reporting system
6237597 throughout this exhaustive search process which began in march one candidate rose to the top and stood out
6237598 receiver maybe running back tight end defensive end defensive back possibly linebacker
6237599 there will be a couple freshmen who are going to have to come in and at this point havent quite decided which two it will be
6237600 the injury situation itself could sort things out were ready to start work for tennessee and if youre hurt
6237601 as a far as me competing i feel i have done all i can its not just running with the ball you have to get the blocking down and protect and catch passes you have to show youre an all around running back and not a limited one
6237602 hes a small linebacker but hes smart and quick and fast and tough
6237603 how effectively he can play well have to wait and see pain will be issue but more importantly can he grab and use his hand
6237604 nice reward for never winning the acc never going to a bcs bowl and never finishing higher than fourth in the acc
6237605 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6237606 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6237607 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6237608 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6237609 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6237610 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6237611 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6237612 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6237613 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6237614 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6237615 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6237616 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6237617 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6237618 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6237619 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6237620 in king county we are pushing for the dream of our namesake the reverend dr martin luther king jr to be reborn by making sure that people from all zip codes and backgrounds have the same access to opportunities in the green economy
6237621 the opportunity greenway pilot program is an excellent example of this ethic of social justice and equity by opening up career pathways for court involved youth to develop livelihoods in critical fields such as green building transportation and environmental protection
6237622 theres a major benefit to the community in helping to guide these young people in a new career direction
6237623 being able to show them the importance of family wages benefits and training then seeing the light bulbs go on in their minds was uplifting to us if everyone in washington did this there would be no kids left behind
6237624 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6237625 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6237626 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6237627 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6237628 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6237629 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6237630 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6237631 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6237632 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6237633 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6237634 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6237635 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6237636 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6237637 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6237638 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6237639 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6237640 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6237641 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6237642 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6237643 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6237644 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6237645 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6237646 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6237647 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6237648 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6237649 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6237650 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6237651 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6237652 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
6237653 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
6237654 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
6237655 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
6237656 petite leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive study reveals
6237657 protester sheehan and public enemy coming to denver for dnc
6237658 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
6237659 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
6237660 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
6237661 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
6237662 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6237663 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6237664 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6237665 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

6237727 the fact that the monetary policy committee even discussed the arguments in favour of a rate cut suggests that it is gradually edging towards a loosening bias
6237728 with inflation set to peak within the next few months and the economy heading rapidly towards recession we still think that interest rates will be falling by the end of this year
6237729 a case could be made for an immediate increase for a cut or for maintaining bank rate at the current level
6237730 in each case there were arguments in favour and against each option also had identifiable risks
6237731 the boe are increasingly concerned about the outlook for growth while the near term worries about inflation are offsetting this for now
6237732 nonetheless with commodity prices having fallen substantially and the labour market downturn intensifying we believe that these inflation fears should subside in coming months
6237733 unlike earlier versions that failed this bill does not spell out what medical care doctors must provide when an abortion procedure ends in a live birth the legislation also specifically says it has no impact on illinois abortion laws

6237739 just this past week we passed out of the us senate banking committee which is my committee a bill to call for divestment from iran as way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they dont obtain a nuclear weapon
6237740 but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
6237741 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
6237742 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations let
6237743 did you the mother eat too many fried foods to cause this what was your spinach intake like did you do your allotted number of toe touchers per day how many hours a night did you get sleep did you take your folic acid what you missed a dose occasionally you murderer

6237745 you will be horrified when stories of women dying from back room abortions hit the news you are hiding behind that fact you want to turn back this decision you are advocating back room abortions
6237746 prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion
6237747 biden voted for the iraq war but beyond that even if we stipulate that he has foreign policy chops how does that make him a good veep choice it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
6237748 is serious about the possibility of a pro choice vp nominee
6237749 is mccain going to screw conservatives again wouldnt put it past him would you
6237750 biden is not a reinforcing choice as he has served in the senate for 36 years and supported the war back in 2002 2003 in two key ways iraq judgment and change election that is very much the opposite of barack obama and could muddle his message still when it comes to ideological leanings and campaign ability biden is a preferable choice to bayh and kaine as a campaigner while biden is often criticized online as never finding a camera he didnt think should be filming him he is very familiar on the national stage with the national media and is a strong debater he is also a good attack dog and you shouldnt have to worry about him falling down in that category maybe my support for biden is mainly a testament to how poor the crop of potential candidates is than anything else after all being preferable to evan bayh isnt really saying much of at all
6237751 on the one hand its not the most exciting choice biden doesnt bring a state delawares going to go democratic biden also occasionally says something really whacked which well probably find out more of if hes the pick on the other hand wholly separate from the cosmetics and electioneering calculus i think hed be a good choice on substance maybe a really good choice most senators grasp of foreign policy is fairly thin and it tends to be heavily influenced by whatever lobbyists or power players are in their orbit but biden has a pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question and his ideas and judgment strike me as fundamentally sane
6237752 i think putting someone who voted for the 2002 iraq aumf on the ticket may be more politically problematic than people realize obama has cited his opposition to that bill as key evidence of his good judgment but presumably youd want to put biden forward as a knowledgeable and experienced foreign policy person thus setting up a problematic contradiction but that vote aside biden really is someone whos genuinely knowledgeable about foreign policy questions rather than simply being strong on defense or some bs whats more picking biden would signal a clear intention to engage with mccain on national security issues rather than try to dodge away from them which is definitely a decision i support
6237753 i was against kaine bayh ne sen chuck hagel and ex ga sen sam nunn i havent thought too much about biden yet he a pretty smart guy but doesnt help obama win in any area of the country so whats the point
6237754 perhaps ive been buttered up by the fairly dismal alternatives being offered but like steve i find biden a surprisingly decent option at a minimum hes strongly preferable to kaine or bayh infinitely preferable to nunn or hagel and clearly behind among vaguely viable candidates only sebelius and ri sen jack reed if i thought the vp choice should be determined by political considerations i would pass his penchant for saying silly things and hailing from a small safe state would rule him out since i think the vp pick should be primarily substantive however i think he would be decent he could play a constructive policy role comparable to gore and is considerably more progressive than most of his assumed rivals for the job he wouldnt be at the top of my list but of the intrade top 3 hes the best by a huge margin
6237755 rather than just repeat myself on why i think choosing biden is a good idea im just going to republish this post explaining why i think its a good idea the only thing id really add is that in the months since i wrote it it was originally a june posting obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
6237756 the idea that a hefty resume is somehow a roadblock to change is ridiculous politicians do not neatly fall into column a experience types and column b change types but this political taxonomy is catchy so certain members of the press gleefully run with it obamas image as a change candidate will not be undercut if he happens to pick a familiar face in politics on one level that image is culled from the historic nature of his candidacy on a deeper level it exists because the entire obama candidacy from the grassroots up has been build on a foundation of change on a need for change and on a belief that the old politics of george bush and john mccain are hurting the american people that foundation is so strong 2 million supporters strong to be exact and millions more who volunteer or support obamas candidacy that it wont be cracked if and when obama chooses an old white guy with decades of d c experience
6237757 biden voted for the iraq war but beyond that even if we stipulate that he has foreign policy chops how does that make him a good veep choice it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws make him secretary of state sure compared to bayh and kaine biden looks almost passable but thats a low hurdle to pass id rather not have to choose my poison id rather have candy im already assuming disappointment on obamas pick so i wont belabor one bad choice or another but id love to see him pick a fresh face in politics who reinforces obamas message of change biden doesnt clinton doesnt bayh certainly doesnt if holding out for ks gov kathleen sebelius is too much to ask for and if obama is going to pick a guy that has been around for decades then pick kerry or even ex sd sen tom daschle but the senator from mbna that choice would be exciting to perhaps two audiences the broderites and the credit card industry
6237758 nr has learned that the mccain campaign has been calling key state gop officials around the country the last couple of days and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick the campaign is asking about the reaction of conservative grass roots activists to such a pick and whether a pro choicer can be sold to them this is an indication that the mccain campaign is serious about the possibility of a pro choice vp nominee and that mccain leaving the door open to tom ridge last week may not have been merely a friendly nod to a longtime supporter
6237759 is mccain going to screw conservatives again wouldnt put it past him would you which is why despite all the encomiums hes received from his saddleback appearance i havent and wont joined the ga ga bandwagon
6237760 lieberman is extremely liberal when he gets off of defense issues and i am not really sure its a great idea to have a guy like in the 2 slot when the head man is 72 years old as to ridge hes a squish closely associated with the bush administration not well liked by conservatives and hes pro abortion still if could carry pennsylvania mccain might have to consider him but take that away and hed be a real dud of a vp choice
6237761 if mccain picked lieberman some would salute the gesture as a genuine effort at bipartisanship but lieberman was effectively cast out of his own party when approval rating in the state is 45 percent vs 43 percent disapproval it would be nice for a republican candidate to win connecticuts 7 electoral votes that everyone is already tossing in the democratic pile but its something of a long shot theres much lower hanging fruit elsewhere new hampshire michigan pennsylvania wisconsin beyond that mccain would be asking republican voters to put a socially and economically liberal democrat a heartbeat away from the presidency said heartbeat belonging to a 72 year old who has survived cancer a lot of republicans and conservatives like joe lieberman but they dont want to see him as president ridge was last elected to high office the governorship of pennsylvania in 1998 its not fair but hes probably most associated with the color coded terror alert system instituted at the department of homeland security is ridge worth 4 to 12 percentage points in pennsylvania he would likely help mccain but not by that much the race has been looking good for mccain for the past few weeks or so picking either of these men would suddenly and irreversibly complicate the task before him immensely
6237762 if john mccain picks joe lieberman as his running mate he would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as radio talk show king rush limbaugh put it in an e mail last night joe lieberman should be commended as a profile in courage on the war in iraq standing athwart the defeatist democratic party at a crucial time in history but that does not a vice presidential candidate for the pro life republican party make
6237763 there are a lot of people getting really upset of late worrying that tom ridge or to a lesser extent joe lieberman could be john mccains vice presidential pick that is not going to happen people should step back from the ledge why do i know it wont happen john mccain does not get to be the republican presidential nominee without a being a smart man and b surrounding himself with smart people and smart people are smart enough to know that a pro choice running mate would sabotage john mccains chances of being president tom ridge joe lieberman and the other potential running mates who are abortion rights supporters are non starters deal breakers and totally unacceptable john mccain knows this he and his campaign want to win in november couple both of those data points and you realize tom ridge and joe lieberman are imagined picked by the media designed to sow discomfort among the ranks of people just coming to terms with john mccain as the gop nominee
6237764 one thing that has come out since i wrote last night makes me think its more likely that mccain made this up the nightingales song a 1995 book about five graduates of the naval academy one of whom is mccain contains a chapter on of all things three christmases mccain spent in captivity thanks to amazons search this book feature and the fact that the chapter in question is only four pages long ive read it and you can too it contains no mention of this incident at all to my mind its a lot harder to believe that mccain never mentioned the story about the cross to robert timberg who wrote the nightingales song than to believe he didnt mention it in his 1973 piece timberg interviewed mccain and that mccain spent a lot of time with him he was moreover writing about christmases in captivity if mccain didnt mention it at the time that would be very odd someone should ask him
6237765 its a bit odd that mccains story about the prison guard drawing a cross in the sand doesnt appear in mccains detailed account of his captivity circa 1973 the first time that ive been able to find mccain mentioning this story is 1999 a full quarter of a century after he was released if it was such a pivotal story in his life why did we not hear about it until mccain had decided to run for president
6237766 i just got off the phone with mark salter john mccains closest aide whom some in the blogosphere are suggesting made up or embellished or did something to create the cross in the dirt story salter told me that he absolutely did not do that
6237767 the reason this is weird is that its not just one memory out of countless ones its a very specific christmas memory about a character mccain recounts in other anecdotes and was a significant enough memory to be packaged as a christmas themed campaign ad last year but this riveting story which mccain will never forget didnt occur to mccain when asked to come up with christmas memories in captivity in 1995 salter explains that mccain could easily have forgotten it because it was not pivotal watch the ad again and listen to mccains testimony from saturday night it sure sounds pivotal to me something that would surely resonate deeply over the years
6237768 byron york goes in depth to tell us how mccain staffers think that john mccain is the best choice for president while obama staffers disagree
6237769 the netroots with absolutely no evidence to back it up has been accusing mccain of making this story up which is cheap even for them seriously theyre accusing a pow of lying about his experiences in captivity to make himself look good based on nothing more than the fact that alexander solzhenitsyn once told a story that was somewhat similar
6237770 anything that keeps mccains heroism front and center without a shred of evidence from any eyewitness that hes lying is tantamount to an in kind campaign contribution more please
6237771 by all means lets focus more attention on mccains stint at the hanoi hilton maybe the obama campaign will offer up as a counterpoint obamas supremely courageous opposition to the iraq war while on the front lines of the illinois state legislature and by all means lets have the left continue its campaign to minimize mccains service in vietnam that should work wonders for obama
6237772 although barack obama remains a slight favorite in this election his position is more vulnerable than at any point since the primaries concluded and he no longer appears to have a built in strength in the electoral college that we had attributed to him before
6237773 it is bitterly disappointing that obama is not ahead by more entering this crucial three week stretch but i guess we will see where things stand one month from now
6237774 there is an incredible discontent out there with the way this campaign is being run
6237775 it is very difficult to not conclude that mccain is winning the messaging war right now if obama is winning in field paid media and free media exposure in a very democratic year what other explanation could there possibly be for it honestly scares the crap out of me that the obama campaign will run another vacuous positive campaign like kerrys that simply does not attack and define the republican nominee in a way that is necessary if things do not go well in the next three weeks mccain could enter the third week of september with a lead similar that the one currently held by obama if that happens he will become the favorite no matter how hard the democratic winds are blowing
6237776 various insiders are now fretting about obamas campaign strategy going off course and are doing what insiders do which is to recommend shifts in how the campaign operates my guess is that as with al gore and john kerry at this point no one is in charge of the obama campaign there are too many competing fiefdoms for message discipline to work thats why lobbying on the inside doesnt really work for things like message changes on a presidential level remember also that just being negative is not taking off the gloves or going on the attack polling about issues and then criticizing mccain based on that data is not working obama is going hard against mccain on big oil and mccain but mccain is still gaining so any effective messaging strategy will have to start from outside and gradually be adopted by the campaign since it will have to seem internally as if the major power centers have independently arrived at the same conclusion
6237777 the obama campaign does not want to be involved in negative campaigning on this scale and perhaps as the new lesser known guy obama has to be more careful of such things that needless to say is why the independent expenditure groups would have been so important its now rumored that the donors have been set free to finance some non campaign related efforts but it would be a miracle if they could pull it off at this late date these things have to be planned something im sure freedoms watch and their advisor karl rove have certainly been doing for months
6237778 liberals have been in a dither for several weeks now over barack obamas supposedly listless campaign performance following his return from europe and as near as i can tell this turned into something close to panic after his performance in saturdays saddleback church pseudo debate obama was deliberate and thoughtful mccain was direct and forceful joe and jane sixpack will take wrong but strong every time give me a break of course mccain was direct and forceful he was on his home turf and he could afford to be abortion life begins at conception gay marriage against it obama of course had no such option whats he going to say that he has a 100 approval rating from naral gay marriage is a gift from god if this had been an afl cio forum the tables would have been turned but it wasnt and obama played the hand he was dealt thats life obamas campaign tactics will almost certainly get more aggressive after the convention when most people finally start paying attention but in the meantime its worth noting that obamas performance at saddleback church might have been better than all the heathens who read this blog think
6237779 obama needs to be more succinct start throwing in better sound bites and needs to reach the gut as well as the heart and the head he needs to get over the c in c threshold but the key to the election is the economy and he needs to better define mccain but you know these arent great mysteries and the campaign has done pretty well so far so rather than give advice to people that dont need it i think ill just sit back and enjoy the next two weeks
6237780 with so many instances of corruption and influence peddling around him and whatever problems with the candidate that are keeping the campaign from letting reporters interview him anymore john mccain is now again charging obama with what amounts to soft treason wanting to lose the war in iraq in order to make himself president the lack of any consistent lines of attack against mccain is becoming palpable
6237781 more thinly veiled accusations of treason its time for the obama campaign to stop respecting john mccains service to this country more than 40 years ago and start pounding him for his repeated failures in judgement over the past firedoglakes
6237782 in his speech to the vfw today mccain not only attacked obamas patriotism repeating the outrageous smear that his rival would put political ambition over americas security after this the media has no further excuse for assuming the man john mccain has become is honorable note to media lying and smearing your opponent are not honorable
6237783 why not do the same in going back at mccain obviously clarks line of attack that mccains pow status is pretty irrelevant to his race for the white house and that he has no actual executive experience drew blood the reaction was fierce and angry which is precisely what you need for a message to resonate with the public at large but really any effective narrative on mccain would work what is clear though is that any narrative that does work draws as clarks did and as mccains celebrity ad did squeals from elite pundits and journalists elites dont like changes in narrative so be aware that any real shift against mccain will be disliked by elites it probably makes sense at this point to work from outside to test different narratives right now there are two competing ideas the first is that mccain is no longer the honorable man he used to be the second is that mccain is old crazy and unsuited to be president
6237784 karl rove perfected the strategy of going right after a candidates greatest strength in kerrys case it was his distinguished military record in obamas case it is his charisma and popularity abroad in mccains case it is his reputation as a maverick his media darling status and his record as a vietnam veteran and pow those are precisely the strengths that need to be taken on squarely and there are more mccain is showing age related performance problems hes taking radical right positions on abortion on foreign policy on social security and more many members of his caucus are profoundly discomfited by the very idea of john mccain as commander in chief what are a few panders and flip flops in comparison the danger for obama is that by listening to beltway consultants and media insiders he may make the mistake of conceding that john mccain was once a man of honor integrity and principle he wasnt honorable at the naval academy he wasnt honorable in his first marriage he wasnt honorable when he voted against mlk day or when he got involved in the keating five he wasnt honorable when he defended the confederate flag as he has admitted hes not being honorable now so when was he honorable there is only so much deference you can pay to a mans captivity at the hands of the nva
6237785 i would not dismiss the possibility of a surprise choice precisely because the obama campaign has the discipline to pull it off still i have to agree with sean that the more build up there is the more pressure there is on the obama campaign to deliver on a big name would a head fake make sense if the obama campaign were going to deliver us a tx rep chet edwards or bless his political heart a mt gov brian schweitzer someone who had all those iphone carrying obama supporters furiously checking wikipedia after they received team os text message not much either theyre playing it straight up meaining biden bayh kaine or sebelius or its some kind of a lister someone for whom the elaborate staging of it all doesnt produce an anti climax that list is probably limited to hillary gore kerry and colin powell though i have real trouble imagining the latter two somebody who had officially disqualified themselves ex va gov mark warner or jim webb would presumably also produce a lot of shock value but i think we need to start discounting some of these second tier picks that dont have strong brands like the jack reeds and the chris dodd s

6237799 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6237800 they told me there are going to be resources here
6237801 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6237802 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6237803 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6237804 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6237805 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6237806 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6237807 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6237808 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6237809 as i said autonomy is the only workable solution to the problem we need greater autonmy and setup autonomous hill councils in jammu poonch and rajouri
6237810 believe me i have not an iota of idea of what is going on
6237811 the bogey of so called economic blockade exposed the kashmiri propagandists in 2008 in july the number of trucks that went to valley was 2300 where as the number of trucks ferrying the goods to srinagar and other areas during the same month last year was 2000
6237812 we can now tell people in cuba that they can trust again in our team because even with defections and betrayal cuban boxing will never disappoint
6237813 d someguy hey thought youd like to know your shoe is untied
6237814 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6237815 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6237816 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6237817 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6237818 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6237819 mentre lui ti da qualche dettaglio e la tua fantasia corre facendosi gi un quadro
6237820 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6237821 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6237822 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6237823 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6237824 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6237825 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6237826 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6237827 regeringen prioriterer eksporten af fetaost h jere end kampen for menneskerettighederne
6237828 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6237829 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6237830 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6237831 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6237832 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6237833 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6237834 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
6237835 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6237836 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6237837 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6237838 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6237839 even a year later we have no doubts that kenny walton and lisa graham were the ones who conspired to kill shea graham in this case
6237840 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6237841 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6237842 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6237843 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6237844 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6237845 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6237846 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

6237849 my campaigns on behalf of some of our most vulnerable people are coming to fruition the forced marriage civil protection act comes into effect in september
6237850 i would like to thank the people of my constituency who it has been an absolute privilege to represent for the last 11 years in parliament

6237852 i will also be doing all i can to help promote whoever is selected as labours parliamentary candidate for the next election illustrating the difference labour has made for the keighley constituency to ensure it continues to have a labour mp after the next election
6237853 ann cryer has been a distinguished servant of the people of keighley for many years first assisting her late husband bob cryer who represented the seat between 1974 and 1983 and then as the labour mp for the seat since 1997
6237854 she knows every inch of her constituency and her understanding of its communities is second to none

6237865 get it off the air and i really mean it
6237866 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
6237867 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
6237868 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth

6237870 i am married to the next president of the united states
6237871 run for governor ok what do i have to do
6237872 why are you calling so soon hes still at school
6237873 the census has been around for 200 years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services
6237874 we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute public money but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools
6237875 its nice to play those sides at this stage weve got ourselves back into some form winning the past four games now lets have a look at it against two sides who could possibly be in the finals
6237876 st kildas obviously got something to play for as we have and our game here against western bulldogs in round 22 will be an important game too
6237877 our focus will be on continuing to play the sort of football weve been playing to be really consistent with it and to expose our younger brigade to the level of intensity consistency and resilience that you need not only for the rest of this year but for next year as well
6237878 hes been doing quite a bit of physical work this week in particular and all indications are that he feels fine hes ready to go
6237879 but the final decision will be made by the neurosurgeon because we dont want to take any risks at all with that type of injury if the neurosurgeon says hes ok we would strongly consider jason to play because hes a pretty important player for us
6237880 beschle chocolatier suisse understands itself as a haute couturier of the industry
6237881 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6237882 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
6237883 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
6237884 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
6237885 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
6237886 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
6237887 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
6237888 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
6237889 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
6237890 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
6237891 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6237892 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6237893 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6237894 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6237895 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6237896 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6237897 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6237898 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6237899 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6237900 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6237901 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6237902 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6237903 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6237904 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6237905 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6237906 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6237907 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6237908 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6237909 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him

6237922 i have called melissa several times to say how much i love her blog
6237923 the only way this blog would be better is if she dedicated 50 of the posts to affordable housing
6237924 not as good as beth spotswoods blog but i like it anyway
6237925 we could not be happier about the state of our growth
6237926 we went from five approvals a year in 2005 to 22 in 2006 up to 30 in 2007 and this year we expect to do more than 30 largely in part to the new prototype embassy suites has always been a category of one and in the last 20 years has proved to be consistent in all phases of the business cycle we are well on our way to exceeding our goal of 300 hotels open under construction or in the pipeline by 2010
6237927 we know that our primary guest base has traditionally been boomers but that is beginning to change as gen x y and millenials come into their own and identify with the embassy suites culture and value proposition
6237928 with flying spoons we are giving our guests the choice to eat when and how they want to while giving developers a competitive f amp b option with a flying spoons estimated at 30 percent less to develop than a traditional restaurant nearly one fifth of our current pipeline has opted to include a flying spoons
6237929 our brand is positioned as a top industry performer with highest margins in full service in excellent condition from a quality standpoint and growing at unparalleled speed

6237932 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
6237933 the kicker is it does show 3 bars of 3g instead of 1 with 2 0 1 so it looks like they just changed the way the bars look with this update now thats useful
6237934 my new iphone 3g i almost threw it out my car window today it dropped 12 calls within 4 hours in downtown houston that is crazy
6237935 i live in the centre of the uks 2nd largest city and my 3g reception is intermittent between 5 bars and zero therefore the connection keeps getting stuck
6237936 and this is after upgrading to 2 0 2 terrible
6237937 wow an acknowledgement by apple of the 3g defect with some of the iphone 3gs well kind of sort of maybe a little bit if you read between the lines
6237938 i suppose that adding in some modicum of connectivity for the new countries scheduled for iphone release on friday could be construed as improved communication with 3g networks
6237939 it may be the beginning of a trend but it may also be a bad sign
6237940 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6237941 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6237942 today items paid with check or money order are 80 more likely to result in an item not received than those paid with credit card or paypal
6237943 also buyers who pay with check or money order are 50 more likely to leave negative feedback than those who pay with electronic methods so starting in late october 2008 we are moving to 100 electronic payments credit cards propay or paypal
6237944 the web has moved on and ebay is stuck in still waters
6237945 the main challenge ebay faces is that it is becoming easier and easier to find things to buy on the web simply by searching for what you want on google during the early days of the web people needed a few big e commerce sites they could trust and that could organize everything that was for sale online that need was filled by amazon and ebay
6237946 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6237947 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6237948 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6237949 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6237950 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6237951 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6237952 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6237953 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
6237954 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
6237955 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
6237956 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
6237957 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
6237958 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
6237959 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
6237960 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
6237961 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
6237962 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
6237963 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
6237964 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
6237965 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6237966 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6237967 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6237968 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6237969 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6237970 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6237971 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6237972 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6237973 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6237974 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6237975 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6237976 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6237977 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6237978 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6237979 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6237980 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6237981 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6237982 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6237983 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6237984 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6237985 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6237986 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6237987 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6237988 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6237989 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6237990 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6237991 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6237992 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6237993 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6237994 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6237995 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

6237998 i think you need to play in the preseason especially the cornerbacks
6237999 there is nothing like going out there and covering guys in game situations hopefully chris and samari will get some reps
6238000 we wont have everybody because we wont have ed but we might have some of the other regulars they have been working hard so well wait and see what bill t trainer bill tessendorf decides the good news is that they have been working
6238001 having them back doesnt change what we do or what we have done so far
6238002 its preseason obviously you dont run everything but they do need to work so far samari has been flying around all over the place and chris looks good too
6238003 we had done a great job of communicating up until that point even on the practice field
6238004 on that touchdown we had two plays called half the guys were playing cover one and the other half were playing two man on that touchdown fabian washington thought we had a trap on so he came off looking for the trap and there was no one on top
6238005 weve had trouble with it even in practice you can make a mistake in preseason and live with it in the regular season because the skill level is so good you cant have that kind of mistake on the back end
6238006 eu n o tomei nenhum cuidado mas fiquei apreensivo o lson que parece que falou para a organiza o n o mexer nas minhas varas
6238007 apenas dei tchau para ela no dia seguinte ela ainda estava meio abatida com tudo que tinha acontecido
6238008 a prova em si n o foi boa hoje n o era o meu dia infelizmente

6238010 essa pista boa r pida que hoje n o era o meu dia acontece
6238011 this is not an ordinary or everyday demonstration the indians have told us they are not afraid if the government declares a state of emergency they prefer to die there and show that this government violates human rights
6238012 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the oil pipeline and gas through the camisea gas pipeline
6238013 she said mom im ok im home but i think somebody might have been in my house
6238014 she called again a few hours later with panic in her voice
6238015 they found a body in merediths room i gotta go the police want to talk to me
6238016 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6238017 he conducted an adulterous affair before leaving his disabled wife enjoys eight residences across the country as well as corporate jets
6238018 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
6238019 the prices of gas are up the prices of milk are up
6238020 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
6238021 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6238022 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6238023 support george bush 95 per cent of the time keep spending 10bn 5 4bn a month for the war in iraq
6238024 first it could be that something further had gone wrong with the plane after the engine exploded another system may have gone down or there could have been a total loss of power
6238025 second it could be that pilots noticed something wrong and had been panicked into taking a course of action that was very unusual that would be a pilot mistake
6238026 having that year off definitely helped the body out i was able to fix a few other things as well
6238027 just being away from the club i didnt have to go to all the meetings and that through the year it just freshened the mind up as well
6238028 hopefully at the end of my career it might add a year or two
6238029 its obviously a massive milestone something im very proud of but i probably wont appreciate it until i retire and realise just how hard it is
6238030 once you get to 200 games it means youve been around for a while
6238031 the key idea in power management is quite simple to shut things off when not in use
6238032 we are in ohio in a significant way with a full operational staff with offices all across the state
6238033 weve been running television ads now for i believe seven weeks we view ohio as a very important part of our puzzle to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency for barack
6238034 there is no question that ohios electoral votes are critical to that victory
6238035 its always a major battleground state its really no different this year
6238036 ive been engaged in a lot of presidential campaigns during my life i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field
6238037 well why dont we just combine the two giving people a stroll through the park 24 7
6238038 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6238039 my focus is on every at bat every game when the season is over ill start thinking about the offseason
6238040 you play every game hard you play to win this time of year a lot of guys have aches and pains and they play through them thats what were paid to do the situation doesnt matter you can be in first place or last place theres only one way to play the game
6238041 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6238042 i cant express to you enough how excited i am
6238043 we just finalized a deal with anheuser busch him silva and chuck liddell are going to be spokespeople for bud light and anheuser busch here in the u s
6238044 its great its really nice that these companies are getting behind mma bud lights been around a long time i think its a great sponsor to have
6238045 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6238046 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6238047 jabba the hut phoning pizza hut drinking cheap cider watching films with rob schneider
6238048 i would like to think im close to getting a game but we will just have to wait and see what happens
6238049 i have picked up on the basics of the game pretty quick but i am on a learning curve and i have still been making a mistake or two playing in the reserves
6238050 i have been mainly playing in the defence since i came over here but i was actually tried out on the wing last weekend and i really enjoyed it
6238051 i have definitely had some problems with homesickness but i am doing my best to get over that
6238052 daniels in contract and everyone seems to be pointing the bone at us with daniel
6238053 i think hes a fantastic player hes 25 years of age but he is contracted to the west coast eagles i dare say hell probably finish his career at west coast
6238054 but i do like watching daniel play so if west coast said he was available wed sit down and have a look see what they wanted and wed go from there if we could do the deal
6238055 weve got an idea of our deficiencies and a pretty good idea of where we need to improve so wed be pretty open to whatever was put on the table
6238056 when we landed they kept us on the runway for about 20 minutes when the doors opened i was on the phone to a friend of mine who works for spanair and who was at the scene
6238057 he said that the left hand motor had some sort of problem causing the plane to crash down after it had just taken off
6238058 the plane landed on the left hand side and the left wing was broken three of the four emergency exits are on the left hand side causing people to be trapped
6238059 the plane was on fire and that then set the field of hay alight that stopped the emergency services being able to reach the plane
6238060 when we landed i saw the largest amount of ambulances i have ever seen there were easily 80 or 90 ambulances that arrived within the 20 minutes we were on the runway
6238061 the first ones were arriving before we had even landed

6238064 we cant afford to let emotion get involved in making what is the right decision for the footy club
6238065 weve spoken to scott about that and scotts going to give it his best chance he knows i wouldve thought that it might not happen but hes giving it his best shot
6238066 he was here for five hours the other day on his day off hes manic about it and if anyone deserves it its scott hes not going to die wondering
6238067 the soft tissue and conditioning of his body he needs another game at that level
6238068 i havent thought about it because its no good dancing at shadows but thats what you get paid for thats why youve got the title well make the decision based on the facts at the time
6238069 to most players i would have thought it was an uphill battle for the amount of time given to play games
6238070 but westy is a unique individual he is the toughest competitor ive seen to be able to play under duress and to get the job done
6238071 i remember we asked him to play on anthony koutoufides one day and he finds a way
6238072 we have a mandate to go out and find the best talent available through our traditional markets and through putting resources into our non traditional markets
6238073 all clubs are now looking at the opportunities given we have two new franchises coming in over the next few years
6238074 we need to find talent and the talent pool has to increase somehow so looking at overseas players is what we will have to do
6238075 we sat down this year and tried to work out how we were going to get a strategic advantage over the opposition
6238076 we felt that given our resources and that we are a strong powerful club we wanted to look at every avenue at looking for players
6238077 the boys were highly recommended to us and we decided they were the two we wanted to look at
6238078 they have gone through an exhaustive two week program and we will make our mind up in the next week or so as to what path we take
6238079 we made a conscious decision that we wanted to do it independently from nixon so we werent going to be compromised if we wanted a player and other clubs wanted that player
6238080 the main difference is that in the afl the players get more protection off the ball in gaelic football there are a lot more elbows and dirty stuff
6238081 there is a lot of skill involved in kicking the australian ball and getting used to it the handballing is very similar to gaelic i havent done a lot of tackling but i presume that would be the hardest getting used to that
6238082 i have loved being here its been a great experience
6238083 its so different to come over from amateur football to a professional set up all the essendon players are dead on they made us feel at home
6238084 a lot of irish people are trying to play in the afl
6238085 he has served his two weeks he trained pretty strongly today and his leadership and voice around the club has been awesome
6238086 we miss his shaw voice during a game and his great run hes one of those players who breaks the lines for us
6238087 im assuming hes available for selection so it depends which way the match committee goes
6238088 i think he has just got a bit of bruising behind the knee the club said theyll train him on friday and see how he goes
6238089 we need the win to make sure we play finals if hes right theres no point holding him back so i would think if hes ready to play he would definitely put his hand up
6238090 im pretty good mates with al so obviously i want him to stay and play for collingwood for the rest of his career
6238091 its out of my hands its something the match committee and the board will sit down at the end of the year and work through
6238092 but ill give al all the support he needs to be at the club next year
6238093 obviously the first few days you get a bit down but time heals and hes running around today being as stupid as he always is
6238094 you heard about the couple of slip ups that he has had but no one sees all the good stuff he does going out to schools and what he does off his own bat helping out mates kids
6238095 all his mates are not troublemakers and weve got the same group of mates he has just had a couple of bad slip ups and he has been pounded for it he has learnt from that he has taken it pretty hard but hell be all right
6238096 weve beaten them the last three or four times so they might bring a new game plan and try something different against us
6238097 weve got a pretty young group thats a lot confidence based all the young kids have got a lot of confidence at the moment so the coach will try to bring that into the game use their confidence and a bit of flair to hopefully get us over the line
6238098 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6238099 the planes tail has broken off from the rest of the fuselage its difficult to describe the scene because its just a mess of metal
6238100 i was going home when i saw an airplane in front of me it seemed to be landing
6238101 i looked at it from the side and what caught my attention was the fact that it was trailing an immense cloud of sand in its wake but then i realised that it had taken off from the runway and i was scared i slowed down and when the plane suddenly veered to the right its right wing crashed to the ground at that point there was a big explosion
6238102 like other major models such as the boeing 737 jet the md 80 series has a long pedigree which dates back to the 1970s it has a safety record very similar to other big aisle planes of its kind spanair the company involved has a good safety record it was involved in one incident in 2001 in liverpool when its undercarriage was damaged on landing but on that occasion no one was hurt
6238103 identification could take until today which only compounds the suffering of families
6238104 the families are in shock people react in different ways some delay accepting whats happened we have to help them come to terms with reality the longer it takes the deeper is their suffering
6238105 often its a question of accompanying people in shock and helping them through the next stage of their trauma and managing practical details
6238106 he cridat als quatre vents i ho clamar sense parar que tot catal pel fet de ser ho no te dret a deixar morir la cobla res ni ning ha de permetre que la seva bella veu sapagui sense cap ress
6238107 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end
6238108 he was interviewed by senior officials after leaving his flight i am not sure what is happening now
6238109 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6238110 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries to prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another
6238111 so many times ive imagined killing him and then killing myself
6238112 a young innocent boy who turned into a monster and a country so full of promise transformed into a concentration camp
6238113 without ever boasting that he was the son of the great leader
6238114 to this day i know nothing of the details of their deaths of whether they blamed me as they perished
6238115 they were sent away to different uninhabited islands in an attempt to end their substandard genes from repeating in a new generation left for dead none of the people made it back home
6238116 if you want to see short people who are suffering from malnutrition you have to go outside the capital ive no reason to doubt this allegation
6238117 today just as he hoped kim vision has been realised
6238118 he has managed to extract resources from wealthier and stronger states by manufacturing crises and generating international instability his brand of nuclear blackmail is a virtual guarantor of bottomless international aid for the worlds most militarised society
6238119 those who have known kim jong il since youth are bound to see him as human not the centre of a god like cult of personality
6238120 i who became a university professor thanks to his father i who travelled to russia seoul and now washington i no longer loathe him i pity him even though he killed my family i have already forgiven him
6238121 show me whos around and i may be friend of

6238128 can attend services anywhere in the world except his temple
6238129 hes involved in virtually every detail and aspect of the ashram
6238130 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6238131 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6238132 the procedure is not one that would be recommended for everybody
6238133 there are definitely groups of patients where this can be done with the same results and fewer complications
6238134 taking on the challenges of delivering diabetes education in todays healthcare environment
6238135 hfcs now represents more than 40 percent of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in soft drinks in the united states

6238137 this past season he broke the all time record for the most catches the most touchdown passes and the most yards gained of any nfl tight end in the history of the national football league
6238138 the problem was when it turned into a peta advertisement and it was against the school lunch program
6238139 the consumption of dairy especially at the younger ages is a problem
6238140 six of the eleven members of the committee including the chair had an association with the dairy industry
6238141 and the chair himself had taken more money without telling the public about it than he was allowed under the law
6238142 it makes absolute nonsense that most of our arable land is still in the hands of our erstwhile colonisers
6238143 n o pode faltar atitude diante do gr mio temos que buscar o gol o tempo todo e puxar a torcida rubro negra para o nosso lado a torcida do flamengo vai ser fundamental para esse jogo que important ssimo para as nossas pretens es no campeonato brasileiro um confronto diferente por estarmos enfrentando o l der vamos com a motiva o redobrada

6238153 distance education is a great way for montanans to save on the cost of education
6238154 with gas as expensive as it is we need to be looking for opportunities to make higher education more accessible and affordable this new website makes it a lot easier to find the online courses at campuses spread throughout the state regardless of where you live
6238155 more than 50 degrees options are available to students ranging from 100 delivery online to about 80 online
6238156 the montana university system now enrolls over 6 000 students in distance education courses each semester these are high quality courses taught by some the university systems best professors
6238157 my doctor told me that if i checked my blood sugar it would improve
6238158 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6238159 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6238160 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6238161 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6238162 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6238163 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6238164 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6238165 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6238166 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6238167 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6238168 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6238169 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6238170 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6238171 its kind of like revenge of the nerds but were not really nerds
6238172 we just dont really care that much my character is pregnant so i really dont feel like doing anything
6238173 theres still a lot of proving to do on my part
6238174 i just came from an audition with a big director
6238175 surprisingly katharine could throw down and was excellent at throwing in improv stuff
6238176 she was riffing for a good five minutes with the squeegee in hand
6238177 i had to be reminded that shes a big star in her world
6238178 everyone has been talking about the end of an era and re stocking the shelves
6238179 going into the year there was a question mark over us weve brought some new players in so its just really a continuation of that question mark over us going into the season
6238180 the good thing about this year is we have found out a bit about our players and well find out a bit more over the next few weeks
6238181 then you can make some really smart decisions based on that information
6238182 its given us an insight to where were at this game game against collingwood will give us further information to use after the season as well
6238183 were still hopeful whether surgery is required or not that it will be a one to two week injury
6238184 depending on the medical outcome of course unless something unexpected emerges we are thinking he will be able to play in the last game and if not then the first final if we get there
6238185 addressing the educational achievement gap of native american students in washington state
6238186 indian education dates back to a time when all children were considered gifted and talented
6238187 its an easy proposition to come to california sacramento is one of the most diverse communities in the nation
6238188 theres a strong hispanic business community in sacramento sacramento understands the hispanic business community
6238189 tap into the new age of commerce to become the new generation of business leaders
6238190 how do we adjust the economy to the changes in the nature of energy we know that small businesses are going to be the solution they have an incredible role to play
6238191 we want everyone to know that we havent gotten our share of the economic pie but were letting our political and business leaders know that its our time
6238192 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6238193 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6238194 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6238195 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6238196 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6238197 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6238198 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6238199 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6238200 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6238201 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6238202 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6238203 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6238204 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6238205 we are not advocating for mongolia to reject north korean workers but to ensure that human and labor rights of north koreans are protected while working in mongolia
6238206 we filed this lawsuit to send a message to employers that race discrimination will not be tolerated
6238207 mr wallace had a distinctive gait in that he shuffled more than walked and those who were in contact with him before he died described him as being visually unwell
6238208 its quite possible he had visited food outlets and used public transport to assist him get around the city last weekend
6238209 this woman has been seen on gloucester street and the hagley park area wearing night attire similar to joans
6238210 of course the weather that morning and since has been very cold which raises real concerns for her wellbeing and safety
6238211 this is turning out to be one of new zealand s worst sewage disasters in years yet horowhenua mayor brendan duffy is still in denial
6238212 a petrol tank with about 1000 litres of petrol caught fire
6238213 the concern everyone had was trying to stop the fire spreading to the nearby buildings
6238214 i woke around 11am and decided to watch some tv and had some nuggets
6238215 we dont like it as much as them the czechs so were going to go home disappointed because weve not won at wembley when we should have won
6238216 im a fan first and foremost and i want england to do well and all we can do is to try and take away the positives
6238217 wed like to tell the fans that we take full responsibility and its on us to get to the world cup and thats the be all and end all for the next 18 months
6238218 its up to us to try and take that club form into england games and believe me were working hard at that
6238219 were coming together working hard and talking about it amongst ourselves and we will get there im sure of that
6238220 we have a good set of lads in there with good players and im sure well get where we want to go
6238221 i just want to sit down and have some hennessy
6238222 the first night i had to share the bathroom james blake went to the bathroom like three times in the middle of the night turning the lights on the next night i was like there is no shot i am staying here im getting the bedroom with my own bathroom
6238223 then they started playing practical jokes on me they eventually got me to leave the last few nights i went back to the hotel james put salami in my pillow he was throwing stuff in the toilet they were so bad so bad
6238224 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6238225 bob may be the most well known television anchor in colorado history but he always told me that he was most proud of the fact that he was a reporter
6238226 he was always asking questions and working to get to the truth
6238227 bob knew how to actually tell the story he did it naturally with a comfortable sense that let the audience know that this was important and hed help them understand whatever was going on in the world
6238228 he really enjoyed sitting around telling stories and i think people could relate to that
6238229 they would pull a chair back in those days and bobs going to tell them the news thats why they showed up and thats why they loved him
6238230 he enjoyed sharing his knowledge of our state and making sure our stories offered context that only his experience could provide
6238231 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6238232 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6238233 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded
6238234 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone that is going to make us want to stay home
6238235 wed joke about how were not sure if a lot of our fans have jobs because theyre always here
6238236 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6238237 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6238238 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6238239 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6238240 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6238241 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6238242 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6238243 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6238244 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6238245 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6238246 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6238247 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6238248 cop light parade sounds like the flying burrito brothers if they were less stoned
6238249 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east

6238258 we have the publics trust and we need to make good on that trust
6238259 in my view todays decision by the board bolsters my position that arroyo is not disabled
6238260 we could tell the public we are doing everything we can to prevent fraud
6238261 right now i dont have the confidence we can say that
6238262 he actually came up to the car that i was in and was complaining and was saying how disgusting it was then he goes and reaches to grab one of the girls and when she pushes him away he punches her in the face
6238263 once you turn someone into an object you can demean them you can degrade them you can disrespect them you can harm them and abuse them
6238264 see were upholding what you want up to uphold so vote for us keep us in office

6238267 we dont know how he got it there wasnt any impact he hadnt been in any barroom brawls or fallen on any chairs or any of that stuff
6238268 we dont know definitively from the mri whether there is more than a bruise best case scenario its just a 15 day dl and he can get some more work in this season but its not going to be one of those things where were going to force it
6238269 as of right now were tba for saturday and sunday
6238270 the options will probably come from the triple a club so well see what gets suggested in the next couple of days
6238271 i think were going to leave him alone and leave him in the bullpen

6238277 i think were going to leave him alone and leave him in the bullpen
6238278 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6238279 i dont think his training has been geared to that part yet
6238280 but in a few years it will be and then i will be ready to kiss my record goodbye
6238281 my preparation is going well we have to wait and see what happens in the final
6238282 eppure io lho visto ho visto quello sguardo posarsi su di me interessarsi di me e ora era solo un sogno

6238284 completing this type of maintenance now is important because it shows how we are committed to our six week closure timeline in 2009

6238286 det k nns som om vi festat i en vecka
6238287 anyone who thinks there are more than a few dozen so called graphic novels worth reading is an idiot
6238288 now you really are the ambassadors of the united states navy and ambassadors of the united states
6238289 i know this ship i know the crew and you are going to do an absolutely superb job
6238290 this ship was tested but you fought valiantly and effectively
6238291 i think that the term shipmate is something honorable and its something that each one of you earns it should be something to be very proud of
6238292 one of the reasons were out and about is really to thank you for the great work that you do what i have seen throughout our navy is that there is a whole range of capabilities that our navy provides that no other navy and id even submit that no other service could do
6238293 when i go out on the road one of the most important things that i come away with is the views from the deckplates the issues that you see or questions that you may have when the mcpon and i go back to washington we can take all that into account as we look to the future and shape the navy of tomorrow
6238294 those two people really get around but how often do you get to see them in person and get to ask them questions it makes a big difference for the crews morale for those two to come out to the ship and take time out from their schedule
6238295 the navy is out there everyday in every corner of the world on watch and making things happen that are truly extraordinary
6238296 across the board the navy is doing unbelievable things doing them extremely well and being part of the fight that is extraordinarily important to our country
6238297 after being in the navy for 18 years i know what a deployment is like but i would equate being an ia and going into afghanistan to being a first term sailor on deployment for the first time
6238298 the courses include an ia deployment readiness brief a family discussion group command coordinators group as well as an ia monthly newsletter and online discussions
6238299 i wish i had the information that i share before i left
6238300 i have the full support of my family which will help a lot during the months ahead
6238301 i supplied food and equipment to the troops i worked with military members from different countries as well as u s forces it was interesting to see everybody work side by side as one team
6238302 i had seen a lot of pictures and talked to people who had already been there before i left home so when i arrived it was everything i expected
6238303 the scariest moment i had was when the camp got hit by multiple mortars and one landed near where i work
6238304 its a fairly large sacrifice by this command to have 49 senior personnel get pulled away to fill jobs in support of our efforts during the global war on terror during such a critical time in our ships development
6238305 this is a huge milestone another milestone in the life of uss freedom
6238306 it was a mere 64 months ago that freedom was a proposal on a piece of paper and here we are announcing the date for its commissioning
6238307 the ship was built with a specific goal and purpose in mind to operate in shallow waters it also has the flexibility as 40 percent of it is large reconfigurable space so that you can put the specific mission packages into it
6238308 i like the opportunity to talk to them about our unique experiences
6238309 its nice to be able to relate to them the navy is so big and so diverse in san diego that we can provide a good cross section of america and really connect with them
6238310 simply being here and having a presence makes a difference
6238311 your time here today pays huge dividends in showing the lasting partnership between the city of san diego and the navy to an audience that normally doesnt get to see what we do
6238312 its nice to see how appreciative these leaders are of our service
6238313 im glad we can provide them with a unique outlook on the navy and what we do
6238314 we originally called upon the navy because we needed helicopters
6238315 the story line called for a joint fbi navy collaboration we called the navy information office and they got back to us with how about we have navy seals fast rope and participate in the scene and we thought that it sounded great
6238316 several friends of mine who are prior military have done this type of work before and they said it was pretty neat this was overall a good opportunity to meet people in hollywood
6238317 this is our first time working with the seals mostly because jack bauer works alone
6238318 we havent worked with them before not because we didnt want to because we couldnt find an opportunity this was the first opportunity we have had to use them and hopefully we are going to have more
6238319 tap is a transition assistance program designed to help assist military members and their families out of the military and back into civilian life
6238320 the service member learns things from job searches va department of veterans affairs benefits financial preparation relocation info all the nuts and bolts that go along with the transition process
6238321 our classes are normally held every two weeks which gives us about 25 separate classes a year
6238322 this means sailors should attend at least twice once approximately 12 months out and then again between the six and three month period
6238323 ive learned a lot of good stuff already such as the va benefits
6238324 i personally think its pretty good material for those getting out
6238325 this is a great class to take and it has helped me out because it informs the sailor of what they would be up against upon separating if they were not prepared
6238326 my brother didnt take it but i have found it very beneficial and so i would most definitely encourage other sailors to take advantage of this opportunity
6238327 ive been given the opportunities i have in the military because of the sacrifices of the military women who have gone before me
6238328 however i would not have been as successful without the excellent leadership and mentorship of military men wise men who expected the best from me and informed me that i had the opportunity to enhance equality for women by my good performance
6238329 you should never sell yourself short if you are working to achieve your goals each step you take in life is important and combined together they make a difference
6238330 its just a new experience in eating in your taste buds

6238334 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly

6238336 i would approach it the same way if he was here
6238337 im trying to compete and get better every day competition pushes us all and you cant look too far ahead if you do you might not be here

6238340 the pro life community has been tracking obamas support for selective infanticide for quite a while but only recently has there been a national discussion on this issue
6238341 on july 20 2000 naral issued a news release roe v
6238342 its quite clear whats going on the radical pro abortionists and no one is more radical than obama and naral will even defend selective infanticide if there is one chance in a million that it will chip away at roe v wade incredibly even naral eventually dropped its opposition to the bill something obama never did his campaign now admits that the wording of the illinois bill and the federal bill were virtually identical which means that when it comes to abortion obama wins the gold

6238350 im tired of walking into these meetings and the only thing thats being talked about is more tax increases
6238351 there is always some movement but i think it is important for everyone to recognize we need compromise here
6238352 everybody can get stuck in their ideology but we all have to give to make this happen
6238353 my first order of business has always been the budget
6238354 then we would have to put it up for a vote and he would have to persuade the republicans
6238355 its not that owners are incompetent its that they often dont find out what was happening until it was too late
6238356 i was looking for better rates for the city naturally everybody does i couldnt do it with cds
6238357 we just had members of the community here helping us raise our hoop house

6238367 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is whats happening to their mortgages whats happening to their gas and electricity bills whats happening to the oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps
6238368 these are the issues they want us to address and look at thats what we have got to deal with and you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september

6238382 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6238383 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6238384 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6238385 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin

6238388 the drop in instant access savings rates reflects banks efforts to encourage people to save for the long term they want to know they have money to play with and cant afford to offer as good deals to attract short term savings that can be withdrawn without penalty at a moments notice
6238389 having instant access to your cash is a genuine benefit but for many savers it means you have to watch the interest rate set by your bank carefully
6238390 thankfully its free to switch accounts so if youre in any doubt compare other offers and see if you can get a better deal elsewhere its a savers market so dont accept a bad rate

6238457 that the internet and the housing hyperinflations transpired within a period of 10 years each creating trillions of fake wealth is i believe only the beginning

6238461 russia says its response to the further development of a u s missile shield in poland will go beyond diplomacy russias foreign ministry issued a statement saying the u s missile shield plans are clearly aimed at weakening russia the u s says the missile defense system is aimed at protecting the u s and europe from future attacks from states like iran the united states and poland signed a deal wednesday to place a u s missile defense base just 115 miles from russias westernmost fringe this is a breaking news update check back soon for further information aps earlier story is below
6238462 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6238463 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6238464 its unfortunate timing and as far as we can tell there is no problem so were wondering what problem pacificorp is trying to solve
6238465 threatening that model makes everybody just get scared to death
6238466 we are going to have clarity here in a really quick fashion

6238473 the match was far from a friendly both teams played at a high level
6238474 we used our creativity in a good manner and the organisation was excellent
6238475 were not the type of team to sit back and wait for our opponents to make a mistake we have to show initiative and keep possession when were under pressure we did that perfectly today
6238476 i want to combine his performance with nigel de jongs theyre a very strong duo as holding midfielders they have a till here and no further mentality and we need that

6238503 the idea of renewable power in and around new york city is very realistic

6238508 everything i play is based on some knowledge of traditional american music
6238509 but im not doing it in a traditional way im trying to create new music not just new words but new musical forms things that are interesting things that might appeal to a broader audience than just hard core blues or traditional aficionados
6238510 i think by age 10 it was pretty clear he wanted to play music and be on stage
6238511 i was young and risk was not really something that i thought about too much
6238512 i can remember when he was maybe 4 years old he could shimmy up a flagpole to the point where youd have to shout to tell him not to go up any higher

6238514 youre shooting for capturing this moment in time between these musicians
6238515 but its not going to happen im too proud to let that go im already so deep into this i dont think theres much of a way out of it ill just keep plugging along

6238528 sea level however has continued to rise unabated according to the altimeter satellites
6238529 a fundamental new trend in atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns in the pacific northwest appears to have begun scientists say and apparently is expanding its scope beyond oregon waters this year for the first time the effect of the low oxygen zone is also being seen in coastal waters off washington
6238530 this suggests that other contributions to sea level rise such as melting of land bound ice have accelerated this inference is consistent with recent estimates of ice mass loss in antarctica velicogna and wahr 2006 and accelerating ice mass loss on greenland rignot et al 2006 but closure of the global sea level budget cannot yet be achieved new satellite observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace launched in march 2002 and administered by nasa and deutsches zentrum f r luft und raumfahrt grace will map earths gravity field approximately once every 30 days during its lifetime should soon provide sufficient observations of the redistribution of water mass to more fully describe the causes of recent sea level change the issues relating to sea level rise and the global water budget can only be addressed when the record of satellite gravity measurement from grace achieves adequate duration grace argo and satellite altimetry are core components of the global ocean observing system failure to maintain any one of these observing systems would seriously impair our ability to monitor the world ocean and to unravel its importance to the climate system
6238531 i have my own memories of the 1950s i recall seeing whiting floating in yaquina bay gasping for air this wasnt a rare occurrence people who lived here will remember the dead fish that littered the beaches
6238532 the lack of wide scale ocean monitoring makes determining the size and movement of the dead zone difficult although some new instrumentation being used this year by osu scientists is helping dissolved oxygen sensors have been deployed on the sea floor both close to shore and in 260 feet of water off newport some of which are sending data in near real time
6238533 ike i am glad you are finally talking about hydrocarbons fyi the middle east hydrocarbon source rocks were deposited in the tethys sea this was a shallow inland sea that generated restricted anoxic marine source rocks the massive carbonate reservoirs of the middle east oilfields are mainly shallow water karsted and fractured dolomites you are so far off base on this that it is really hard to even begin to take what you said seriously wrong tectonic setting wrong source rock environment wrong reservoirs wrong structural setting try again global ocean stratification forming oilfields i have never heard of this in my career as a petroleum geologist there is way too much junk science on this website
6238534 examples of modern sapropel formation within the oxygen minimum zone beneath upwelling high productivity surface waters can be found on the continental slope of the arabian peninsula and in the california borderlands upwelling in the northwest indian ocean provides sufficient surface productivity to provide an excess of organic matter to sediments on the continental slope of the arabian peninsula where the oxygen minimum zone intersects the slope off california the combined effects of sluggish circulation in semi isolated basins continental margin depths within the oxygen minimum zone and high surface water productivity all contribute to accumulation of laminated organic rich sediments in the santa barbara basin anoxic sediments have been widespread in the past and are of great economic importance as source rocks for hydrocarbon deposits expansion and intensification of the oceanic oxygen minimum zone probably during times of reduced thermohaline circulation is one mechanism that seems to account for many sapropels deep basins connected only by shallow connections which resulted in restricted bottom circulation were especially common during early stages of continental rifting that formed the atlantic basin
6238535 this was a shallow inland sea that generated restricted anoxic marine source rocks the massive carbonate reservoirs of the middle east oilfields are mainly shallow water karsted and fractured dolomites you are so far off base on this that it is really hard to even begin to take what you said seriously wrong tectonic setting wrong source rock environment wrong reservoirs wrong structural setting
6238536 but what do cloud measurements indicate for the ocean regions with most cooling
6238537 some of the strongest forcing is located off the coasts of east asia europe and northeast united states
6238538 it is true that transport of heat to deeper layers my be a part of the signal moc shutdown but in my opinion the magnitude and speed of the cooling are too large to be entirely explained this way the upper 750 m of the ocean cooled by about 3 x 10 22 j in 2 years this is equivalent to a heat flux of about 0 48 pw or a circulation change of 116 sverdrup degrees c the difference in mean temperature above and below 750 m is about 7 7 degree c that means that in order to achieve a sufficient downward heat flux the circulation would have to change by 15 sv more or less instantaneously and remain that way for 2 years 15 sv is the same order as the mean magnitude of the overturning circulation itelf that would mean that the entire moc would have had to have shut down instantaneously in 2003 and remained shut down for the past two years this conflicts with harry brydens estimate of the moc that he published in nature last year which he computed to be about 15 sv from his hydographic cruise in march of 2004
6238539 a small amount of cooling is observed at the surface although much less than the cooling at depth
6238540 since the ocean component of the climate system has by far the biggest heat capacity
6238541 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use
6238542 it sounds like your theory is that somehow only the sun and nothing else contributes to the observed change
6238543 just because the door is closed does not mean that an open window is not available
6238544 the spectrally averaged effective emission temperature of the earth is about 252 k which corresponds to the physical temperature near the 6 km level this is also then the approximate location of the spectrally averaged tau 1 level from which most of outgoing flux can be said to originate from
6238545 sami solanki and his team at the max planck institute for solar system research in katlenburg lindau germany have looked at the concentrations of carbon 14 in wood and beryllium 10 in ice as far back as back 11 000 years ago
6238546 the most recent calculations by solankis team suggest that the sunspot crash could lead to a cooling of the earths atmosphere by 0 2 c as big as the most optimistic estimate of the results of restricting greenhouse gas emissions until 2050 in line with the kyoto protocol
6238547 if the earth does cool during the next sunspot crash and we do nothing when the suns magnetic activity returns global warming will return with a vengeance

6238602 on obamas best day he cant hold a candle to clarence thomass intelligence
6238603 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6238604 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6238605 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6238610 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6238611 speculating all day on who senator mccain chooses as his running mate is not the point of this conference call

6238807 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6238808 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6238809 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems
6238810 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6238811 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6238812 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson

6238820 the problem here is the pricing structure has changed the iphone went down to 200 the samsung instinct went down to 230
6238821 this is no longer the same phone market we had a year ago
6238822 what matters to them is what they can do why do people love iphone they love the apps why dont people love windows mobile its in fact an amazing operating system but the apps on top of it not so inspired
6238823 its really exciting its one of the biggest mysteries right now
6238824 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6238825 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6238837 when i look at gerrit cole i think about guys like georgias josh fields and cal state fullertons wes roemer guys that can dominate
6238838 he already has two plus pitches and his changeup has really improved this summer that really got everyones attention
6238839 i want to work hard and improve on what ive already accomplished as a player i also know that im starting fresh here at ucla
6238840 nothing i did in high school or the draft means anything at this point im a freshman on this team and i need to work hard and earn a spot
6238841 hopefully i can earn a spot in the weekend rotation
6238842 one of the biggest things i notice about gerrit is how great of a teammate he will be

6238844 ive talked to many coaches in the city and they said this kid should have been up there with the rest of his class in division i college and off to the nba

6238852 when i came here as a transfer student i was still trying to find myself as a student once i got here it seemed like it all clicked because i was studying english which is something i was very passionate about

6238919 the government has been engaging constructively at eu level for more widespread application of reduced vat rates to energy saving and energy efficient products
6238920 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long lifecycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6238921 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
6238922 currently a lot of people cannot justify spending a huge amount on a product just because it lasts longer

6238933 consider whether a fifth grade students religious expression on a classroom project may be categorically identified as offensive and therefore legitimately censored by state school officials
6238934 penalizing christian students for expressing their beliefs in the classroom is unacceptable under the constitution
6238935 the first amendment exists to protect private speakers not to enable religious discrimination by government officials the court of appeals unprecedented classification of student religious speech as an offense worthy of censorship should be reversed

6238963 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6238964 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6238965 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned
6238966 i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6238967 one can only imagine the abject horror on the plane
6238968 people here are calm but we dont know whats happening outside the flights are delayed and we have to wait
6238969 when i came to the airport i saw smoke and where it was the incident happened when the plane was taking off and one of the engines stopped working and the pilot managed just to turn the plane into terminal four
6238970 we are just looking at the screens because the flights are going to be delayed
6238971 this is the first and hopefully the last incident like this here that i know of
6238972 the whole back end of the plane was just burnt to a crisp
6238973 the names of the passengers and crew on board the aircraft will not be released until all next of kin have been notified and a special helpline number has been established for relatives and friends seeking information about those who may have been on board
6238974 spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6238975 whether they were actually on board at the time of the crash is still not clear
6238976 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6238977 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6238978 we have to strengthen control measures in ivory trade to abide by provisions of the convention in in endangered species cites which requires specific legislation
6238979 and until that is in place dealing in ivory products will be prohibited
6238980 the government has been engaging constructively at eu level for more widespread application of reduced vat rates to energy saving and energy efficient products
6238981 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6238982 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we have
6238983 a lot of people cannot justify spending a huge amount on a product just because it lasts longer but if this recommendation is followed through it should encourage modern electronics manufacturers to produce more sturdy products as standard

6238990 at least senator mccain is being honest a vote for him is a vote for the draft period unless senator mccain radically changes his worldview there would be a draft to implement his plans
6238991 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end there may be some press there
6238992 we cannot comment on whether an individual will be allowed access to the country
6238993 its up to the chinese authorities to decide whether they allow him to enter
6238994 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6238995 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had
6238996 a girl or young man who hears a fatwa doesnt just obey he goes to google and hears other opinions and discusses
6238997 do you know the city will be larger than washington
6238998 saudi arabia today doesnt offer the kind of services that are required
6238999 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing we have about 60 per cent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
6239000 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
6239001 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
6239002 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
6239003 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
6239004 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
6239005 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
6239006 if iran involves itself more in iraq and the americans tried to back the shiites well resort once more to the religious establishment
6239007 it is something i have to look at they both worked their socks off and did well at times we were unfortunate not to get a goal in the second half when james had a point blank effort saved if that goes in we win the game and you say the partnership worked
6239008 james and kenny lacked that little bit of a cutting edge up front when you put a team under pressure at home you need to put the ball in the net but we lacked that edge we needed to win the game
6239009 there is still a lot of work to be done on their partnership but they work hard it takes time for any partnership to form at home we want to play with two up front and put the opposition under pressure
6239010 we wanted to have a look at a more positive system at home and it wasnt for the want of trying to attack it was a good exercise some parts worked well and others we have to take a look at
6239011 we have four or five good strikers in the squad who all bring something different
6239012 james and i had the shirts tonight and i feel it went pretty well we linked up well and the keeper had a couple of good saves from james i just hope it can only get better for the world cup ties
6239013 you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers we are fortunate to have that they are both outstanding craig gordon has been terrific for scotland allan mcgregor has also proved he is top class and thats a healthy position for us
6239014 we also have an excellent keeper in david marshall as further back up at this precise moment craig is our number one and has not put a foot wrong but he knows allan has got another 45 minutes under his belt for scotland and shown he is also a top keeper
6239015 i thought he was the best player on the park tonight he can play in a wide or central role in midfield and he was outstanding
6239016 we wanted a win but it didnt happen i was a good workout though and we were able to blood a number of players darren barr christophe berra kris commons and michael stewart all did well when they came on it was good to see fresh blood who can do a job for us
6239017 thank goodness you like that stuff now i can concentrate on solving real problems with c
6239018 quien acabar con las descargas p2p no seremos nosotros sino las telef nicas
6239019 our objective is to make money here on a 10 year investment
6239020 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
6239021 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6239022 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6239023 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
6239024 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
6239025 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
6239026 its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee
6239027 these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know before hand you want him to tell you this is how i see it
6239028 the irb rugby committee agreed that no meetings take place with match officials so that no undue pressure was placed on them prior to matches
6239029 no other sport meets with the referee before hand and all teams with the exception of south africa have been very happy with this process
6239030 teams can and have contacted me with issues before games and national coaches are invited to report back on refereeing performances after internationals 80 per cent of the teams do so and this is a very useful resource for the irb referee selection committee
6239031 complaining about refereeing through the media is not the forum with which referees will be reviewed
6239032 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
6239033 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
6239034 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
6239035 really i was gonna buy a snow globe for my mom
6239036 lets split up me momo chan sgt umeda and lt yajima will head this way towards the barracks the rest of you can go that way towards the cafeteria

6239049 why does he know so much about military structure and rank

6239051 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6239052 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6239053 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6239054 theyre folks who dont typically need the social badge of a premium brand theyre confident in themselves and in their own skin
6239055 how much will the hyundai badge deter buyers who want a premium vehicle
6239056 if a good rain doesnt come soon corn yield will go down and some of bean pods will fail to produce any beans so the situation bears watching
6239057 were a canadian company competing against big giants from china and were capable of having our product at a lower retail and were capable of moving profit off of that unit
6239058 our main goal right now is to clean the canadian market and get very very strong with all of the biggest retailers in canada
6239059 when the market is going to get better in the u s then well go down to the united states
6239060 we have to restructure our finances so we have a better platform for the future
6239061 the company has not got a proper financing from the very beginning
6239062 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6239063 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards
6239064 most people dont understand the specific details of how or why these things happen so they simply get a general impression that there was a problem with the product and it makes them very wary of that companys product
6239065 it usually means the company has to spend a lot of money on promotion and advertising that will re establish their credibility one element of that is how they handle the recall
6239066 we fully expected the first half of 2008 to be very difficult for maple leaf due to the extreme inflation and volatility in commodity markets
6239067 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6239068 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6239069 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6239070 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6239071 a lot of things happened through the year that i was not happy with in many ways
6239072 but i think because of family now ive decided its the right time to put all my energy into my family and recharged my batteries and myself too
6239073 the dncc community credentials incorporate patriotic design elements they do not depict an actual american flag the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
6239074 all we know is that he violated the criminal code and was illegally accessing those taxpayers information
6239075 tigta and the irs take the security of taxpayer data very seriously tigta uses a computer based detection program that analyzes access to tax accounts and identifies those with potential unauthorized access unax issues
6239076 cases with confirmed unax issues or any other potential criminal violations are forwarded to tigta field offices for further investigation
6239077 tigta also receives allegations from taxpayers and other irs employees individuals found to have committed unax violations are subject to federal prosecution termination of employment or other disciplinary action

6239082 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6239083 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6239084 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6239085 the fact that people were up there kicking the tires means nothing from a financial standpoint and therefore really shouldnt really play into what the price of these stocks is doing today
6239086 we were not hosting this tour it was not our initiative we were simply asked by a third party to go up there and give a broad overview which we did
6239087 its nothing new capp does these presentations often to a very wide demographic be it media politicians or investors this was no different
6239088 yeah but hes the same guy who said that inflating your tires makes oil companies rich
6239089 the company is optimistic that first production from dolores will take place at the end of the third quarter but notes this may be pushed back to early in the fourth quarter as a result of the most recent illegal blockade
6239090 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and

6239100 consistent with conditions in the broader economy advertising markets have slowed in the new financial year the company said
6239101 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6239102 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand fairfax chief executive david kirk said
6239103 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth he said
6239104 in many ways the bay area film community is a legacy of faf
6239105 its not entirely faf s doing but i strongly believe that there wouldnt be the rich and vibrant doc scene in s f if it werent for film arts i know for me at least i probably wouldnt be doing what im doing i really knew nothing about independent film when i wandered into the old faf office on 9th st in the mid 90s i was making a kooky documentary the rainbow man john 3 16 but i had no idea what one would do with that kind of film through faf i connected to a whole filmmaking world over time i began to see that making independent documentaries in the bay area would be something that one could do one could even think of it as a career im sure there are dozens if not hundreds of similar stories to mine
6239106 we set up an organization to get a government grant to purchase a steenbeck editing table
6239107 and then have members share the table so they could edit their films at a cheaper cost
6239108 it was all about the community there was no money but there were some members our job was to gather things up and strengthen the organization so we started doing all kind of events we started doing work in progress screenings we had a membership meeting every year and created a whole thing around that with guest speakers
6239109 people who didnt have a lot of experience who maybe were in film school to not only get an education but to get internships to work on productions that were actually happening
6239110 faf had a project file for active productions where the producers were seeking interns
6239111 creating and cultivating a sense of community is a chief legacy for faf
6239112 there are other organizations in the bay area across the state across the country that provide certain services or information or expertise but film arts is very unique in the way weve created community by that i mean people in their careers after they no longer need the classes or the funding or the introductions or any of the services we provide they still want to be part of this community that weve all created its a genuine passion and concern for filmmakers this has shaped everything that we do thats what has kept people connected to wanting to be part of this community
6239113 we saw that filmmakers were running into the wall over and over again of not having enough money to pursue their vision
6239114 there was not a structure in place particularly for experimental filmmakers particularly for those in the highly speculative stages of making a film research and development we were trying to identify and target those kinds of projects where a small amount of money could really really make a substantive difference
6239115 unlike a fellowship program that was recognizing a body of work or the potential of particular artists we wanted to make it a very specific program that would yield finished works
6239116 in the earliest rounds of the program we had established well known artists competing for grants with newcomers our underlying purpose was advocacy always advocacy to demonstrate to funders who were reluctant to engage in any film funding because it was perceived as a prohibitively expensive art form we wanted to demonstrate that even small grants awarded strategically could yield important new works and launch them into the world
6239117 julie and gail were always going out to foundations that didnt fund media or were on the fence and making the argument
6239118 there are many things an organization could have done and faf could do and did do library equipment classes
6239119 but the one thing faf was singularly positioned to do was advocacy for the larger purpose of media and reflecting back to largely isolated individual makers that they were part of a larger cultural force for change where a rock ross is as important as a les blank as a trinh t minh ha as someone just signing up for his first film class at s f state
6239120 that was when a young filmmaker could go in there and really blossom
6239121 i can still remember the first time dan and i waked in with our first idea that became our isadora duncan documentary isadora duncan movement from the soul 1989 we were in our mid 20s and gail and julie helped whip our proposal into shape and advised us who we might want to hire as crew they connected us with ashley james who became our dp then bob hawk called and said hed like to arrange a wip screening for us for me the height of faf was this proactive effort on the part of the staff to reach out to local filmmakers
6239122 in our program which not all programs do we offer consulting services to help the filmmaker get their applications and proposals in their best possible form and be a blueprint that they can use for any future fundraising efforts
6239123 plus we advise on distribution and fundraising and connect people in the community so they can bring on other team members and provide introductions to other parties including possible funders
6239124 many foundations particularly in the bay area look at us as a vetting agency in a way
6239125 we wont approve until a project is at a point where its worth sending out to an institution
6239126 that allows us to be advocates of and supporters of the film
6239127 its fun for me because sometimes it feels like im mini producing 250 films cause thats what a producer does is try and get films funded
6239128 its one aspect of film arts that has always been much needed by the filmmaking community and even though the environments changed the technology and the way people make films has changed filmmakers still need and will continue to need this service
6239129 and to me the film societys a natural home for it if we didnt provide those services i believe there would be a real hole
6239130 we have all these seasoned or experienced filmmakers whove been film arts members for years but there are so many new filmmakers every cycle who are eager to get started and they view the fiscal sponsorship program as the first step thats exciting because its the new generation
6239131 it was also a place where your day job might have been that you were driving a cab but that wasnt your persona once you walked through the front door you were a filmmaker i didnt find out peoples day jobs for years it didnt matter you didnt have to be anybody but a filmmaker once you walked in
6239132 no matter what we go we show up we line up we play football
6239133 no matter what we go we show up we line up we play soccer we win
6239134 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6239135 what a sad man almost as sad as the russians that seem to want to go to bed with such a cretin so mr assad your logic is america helps georgia so you should get help from russia perhaps you should be careful because the logical extension of your argument is the us invades syria
6239136 the formal process leading to georgias membership of nato has begun partly because of russias occupation
6239137 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
6239138 multiple failed applications can be time consuming and of course can be detrimental to a borrower
6239139 with criteria changing regularly and the risk of decline increasing all the time it is even more important that borrowers looking to obtain a mortgage use reputable mortgage professionals with broad experience knowledge and systems at their disposal which will increase the chances of the borrower getting the deal they need
6239140 the focus in the mortgage market is now on availability more than anything else with financially strong and experienced lenders the most likely to offer credit
6239141 but unless we control wages then all your wage increase will be eaten up by inflation
6239142 we are aware there is a great need for such a collection in the area
6239143 we will be trialling a collection plan during the 2008 09 financial year
6239144 residents wanting to get rid of a second working fridge can do so at no cost providing 20 stairs or less are involved in the removal
6239145 the state government is ignoring the mounting problem with the manufacture use and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment purchased by australia accounting for over 42 million tonnes of greenhouse gases a year
6239146 i would like to commend the rcmp the combined forces special enforcement unit cfseu and international law enforcement partners for the hard work and coordinated efforts in project colis e which led to this apprehension and the seizure of illicit drugs the seizure of 300 kilograms of cocaine sends a strong message to anyone involved in the illicit drug trade this arrest is consistent with ongoing efforts of canadian law enforcement to tackle serious drug related crime through inter jurisdictional and cross border cooperation the government of canada continues to recognize that illicit drugs undermine healthy families and safe communities fuel organized crime and foster petty crime as part of our governments national anti drug strategy we have invested 8 9 million in the rcmp and 3 3 million in the canada border services agency cbsa to enhance their abilities to target illegal drug producers and traffickers
6239147 this is your second warning that the factory warranty on your vehicle is about to expire
6239148 for the first time in our country republicans will give a damn about service reform prosperity and peace
6239149 this blacklist will keep dubious airlines out of europe it will also make sure that all airlines operating in europes sky meet the highest safety standards
6239150 when you consider the amount of aircraft built and operated it is one of the most remarkably safe aircraft
6239151 the black boxes could solve the mystery if they are recoverable but the intensity of the fire could have severely damaged them a lot ground around the aircraft was on fire which indicates a substantial fuel spillage
6239152 its very difficult to speculate in the early stages but quite evidently a key focus for air accident investigators will be an engine catching fire but also reports that the pilots may well have delayed departure for some technical issue
6239153 if that report proves true then the air accident investigators will be poring over maintenance records with even more attention than they would do to see if any problems are indicated
6239154 we expect the current property market volatility to remain for the foreseeable future with the timing of recovery in property markets in the us and uk dependent on the recovery of liquidity in the financial markets mr clarke said
6239155 the us and uk residential markets continue to suffer from lack of liquidity and inventory overhang
6239156 in comparison the australian market is stronger and while slowing should not see the same level of impact
6239157 our strong positive cashflow combined with capital recycling has provided cash on hand of 842 8 million allowing us to continue to fund our investment pipeline while exploring growth opportunities he said
6239158 mr clarke had given the company a commitment of between five to seven years when he was appointed in december 2002 chairman david crawford said
6239159 greg has driven a tremendous turnaround in the fortunes of lend lease since he joined
6239160 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
6239161 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
6239162 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
6239163 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
6239164 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
6239165 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
6239166 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
6239167 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
6239168 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
6239169 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6239170 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments

6239186 lindas eyes just lit up and she said oh that was her she claude bolted out of the store and ran her innes down
6239187 so responsible the idea she would leave the store without saying where she was going
6239188 i looked at her when she came in i thought oh my goodness that is just a dead ringer for kerry weaver innes er character
6239189 i said you knew this and you didnt tell me anyhow i just said ill be back in a minute i tapped her on the shoulder in the shop down the way
6239190 i have six months left on my contract i havent been talking to anybody ive been gone for a week and a half kind of in off and on negotiations with kare at this point theres no plan to depart or anything at this point

6239195 the rest of the sons are normal go to office types with an occasional foray into tommy bahama shirts and shorts if david owns a tb shirt it is black and rumpled the guy is a mess love him to death and very proud of his work but david commenting on anyone elses style choices is like carlos gomez describing what it takes to be a good lead off hitter

6239202 clearly customers have embraced this agreement and given us strong feedback and completely support the approach weve taken

6239204 instranets dimensions technology is a killer world class application that puts context around information so data appears quickly and is relevant and it can be implemented at scale
6239205 instranet gets customers up and running very quickly and we are very big on getting customers up and running quickly rather than putting them through some two year slog
6239206 the acquisition of instranet will throw gasoline on the fire we have got going in a marketplace that is prime for growth
6239207 we sell for a living so well be taking the skills we use every day in our jobs and apply them to something different

6239209 we want to win and more importantly we want to beat the other microsoft team
6239210 we are trying to raise 20 000 we want to blow the minimum figure

6239216 as previously advised the performance of the new zealand operations has been impacted by deteriorating market conditions and increased competition in the business division
6239217 opportunities for margin improvement in the new zealand operations have been identified and management of the australian and new zealand business were merged earlier this month we expect to see the benefit of this initiative through reduced costs enhanced margins and accelerated earnings growth in the coming year
6239218 the business division bore the brunt of the market changes with revenue down 7 and ebitda down 27 within this midmarket revenues were down 9 new units down 16 as sales cycles lengthened and client spending tightened
6239219 however it was extremely pleasing to see that support and maintenance revenues were up 20
6239220 however the launch of the new document management product and the uptake of the accountants resourcing service are expected to stimulate renewed improvement in sales bookings in the second half
6239221 in examining the business closely the opportunity for significant margin improvement in the new zealand business has become more apparent as a result the management of the australian and new zealand businesses has been merged as of this month to capture the benefits of scale and ensure were applying our best practices to serve clients in these markets
6239222 i came home one day from work and i was used to being really tense
6239223 unfortunately most developers have built enterprise applications to meet their current systems environment and the end user was very secondary
6239224 now the end user experience is the driving factor because end users determine whether or not the application is considered successful
6239225 if youre in the ecosystem of working on staple on premise software you can take care of feeding and watering those systems
6239226 but those low value tasks no longer need to be done and you wont cover the it equivalent of infantry you want to be the it equivalent of special forces

6239242 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6239243 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6239244 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

6239289 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6239290 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6239291 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6239292 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden

6239294 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6239295 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6239296 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6239297 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6239298 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients

6239300 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice

6239302 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6239303 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction

6239305 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions

6239307 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
6239308 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
6239309 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic

6239322 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6239323 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6239326 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6239327 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6239328 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6239329 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6239330 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6239331 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6239332 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6239335 marley and me life and love with the worlds worst dog
6239336 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6239337 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6239338 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6239339 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6239340 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6239341 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6239342 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6239343 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6239344 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6239345 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6239346 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6239347 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6239348 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6239349 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6239350 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6239351 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6239352 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

6239354 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

6239358 thanks to all of you for caring enough to ask after my health after looking at the reaper in his face here is what happened i flew to toronto to give a paper and photographic presentation at the conference concerning carnival held in connection with caribana at york university instead upon arrival i got very sick and had to be carried to a hospital emergency room it was revealed that i had a case of internal bleeding caused by a stomach ulcer the situation seemed at first fairly straightforward to treat however a few hours after being diagnosed i was struck down by a massive heart attack while still in the hospital it was later also found that my kidneys were functioning at only 20 capacity this complicated matters dramatically all together i spend seven days in the hospital i have been told that going home was out of the question before they perform an angiogram to locate the blockage in my arteries and that in all likelihood i would have to undergo an angioplasty
6239359 since i have no insurance the onus is on me to pay the anticipated costs of the procedures upfront we dont yet have the exact figures but what we do know is that the amount will be significant and that this has to be done as soon as possible in order to avert the risk of another attack besides the angiogram and angioplasty i also have to deal with the seven days hospital bill 2500 can a day not including doctors fees and tests i am at present recovering at a friends home in chicago where i was driven by car i will return to toronto as soon as the doctors have made the final decision about when the procedure can be performed safely and when we have resolved the financial complications in the meantime i am happy to report that i am reasonably stable give or take the occasional chest pain and comfortable thanks to my friends hospitality and to your good wishes
6239360 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6239364 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6239365 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6239407 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6239408 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6239409 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6239410 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6239411 this is a planning took where all things are going
6239412 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6239413 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6239414 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6239415 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6239416 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6239417 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6239418 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6239419 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6239420 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6239421 palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6239422 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent and much appreciated care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6239423 provide further momentum in our efforts to deliver improvements in palliative and end of life care services
6239424 were rightly proud of our education system but its distinctive nature inevitably means the challenges faced by scottish teachers sometimes differ from the rest of the uk
6239425 im sure the new services will make an invaluable contribution to the wellbeing of scottish teachers and thereby the education of scottish children

6239433 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6239434 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6239435 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6239436 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6239437 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6239438 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6239439 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6239440 in many cases schools put barriers in the way of students trying to do two things at once
6239441 we have not organised schools on the assumption that kids might be in and out we need to reconstruct education and schooling to acknowledge that there are blurred boundaries
6239442 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6239443 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6239444 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6239445 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6239446 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6239447 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6239448 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6239449 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6239450 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6239451 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6239452 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6239453 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6239454 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

6239456 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6239457 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6239458 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6239459 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6239460 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6239461 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6239462 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6239463 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6239464 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6239465 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6239466 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6239467 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6239468 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6239469 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6239470 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6239471 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6239472 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6239473 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6239474 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6239475 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6239508 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6239509 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6239510 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6239511 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6239512 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6239513 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6239514 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6239515 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6239516 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6239517 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6239518 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6239519 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6239520 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6239521 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6239522 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6239523 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6239524 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6239525 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6239526 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6239527 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6239528 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6239529 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6239530 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6239531 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6239532 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6239533 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6239534 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6239535 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6239536 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6239537 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6239538 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6239539 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6239540 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6239541 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6239542 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6239543 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6239544 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6239545 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6239546 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6239547 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6239548 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6239549 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6239550 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6239551 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6239552 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6239553 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6239554 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6239555 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6239556 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6239557 we will have plenty of time to stop and look around once we get to the top ok there are plenty of things to look at up there

6239569 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6239570 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6239588 we are still in the process of assessing exactly what has been damaged and what steps we need to repair the damage
6239589 so we are still in kind of an assessment stage right now and once we have that figured out we will cost out the repairs and move forward from there

6239597 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6239598 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6239599 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy

6239618 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6239619 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6239620 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6239621 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6239622 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6239623 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6239624 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6239625 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6239626 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6239627 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6239628 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6239629 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6239630 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6239631 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6239632 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6239633 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6239634 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6239635 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6239636 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6239637 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6239638 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6239639 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6239640 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6239641 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6239642 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6239643 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6239644 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6239645 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6239646 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6239647 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6239648 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6239649 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6239650 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6239651 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

6239654 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6239655 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6239656 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6239657 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6239658 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6239659 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6239660 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6239661 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6239662 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6239663 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6239664 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6239665 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6239666 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6239733 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6239747 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers
6239748 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6239749 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6239750 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6239751 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6239752 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6239753 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6239754 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6239755 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6239756 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6239757 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6239758 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6239759 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6239760 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6239761 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6239762 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6239763 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6239764 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6239765 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6239766 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6239767 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6239768 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6239769 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6239770 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6239771 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6239772 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6239773 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6239774 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6239775 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6239776 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6239777 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6239778 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6239779 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6239780 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6239781 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6239782 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6239783 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6239784 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6239785 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6239786 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6239787 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6239788 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6239789 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6239790 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6239791 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6239792 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6239793 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6239794 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6239795 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6239796 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6239797 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6239798 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6239799 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6239800 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6239801 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6239802 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6239803 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6239804 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6239805 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6239806 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6239807 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6239808 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6239809 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6239810 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6239811 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6239812 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6239813 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6239814 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6239815 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6239816 it must be tough to admit to yourself you are too lazy to take the step of using a spoon

6239829 basically whatever two parties want to contract to they can
6239830 are valid and enforceable if the court deems them to be reasonable
6239831 i really loved the script and having done harry potter i wanted to do something different it was quite a challenge
6239832 id say the most important issue is how might the county participate
6239833 i think theres a 10 million shortfall somewhere in their negotiations and theyre looking for a way to do that
6239834 its got to be something that the increased value thats generated by the stadium would be used to offset the cost
6239835 does it make sense financially should we participate at all

6239848 he was groping and grasping for words he couldnt find what he wanted to say but the worst thing he said was that americas best days were back there somewhere and im thinking what days were those people are going to get the perception that he really thinks that americas not that great a country right now
6239849 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a flag pin on my lapel shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest

6239939 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6239940 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6239941 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favours the guy thats had a good year
6239942 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway
6239943 this is my third pair of contact lenses in my left eye third one of the week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of it
6239944 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again

6239956 it is part of the australian governments commitment to improve the long term viability and quality in nursing homes
6239957 the establishment of the acc along with changes to other advisory groups will help ensure groups can provide the government with relevant advice regarding aged care

6239960 the new national quality framework needs to be ambitious comprehensive and easy to understand said ms mckew
6239961 i hope parents operators educators and anyone with an interest in early childhood development will attend these consultations and give us their feedback on what they think the new framework should look like
6239962 parents academics operators and the wider community have a golden opportunity here to help design a new and exciting national framework that will give our children the very best start in life

6239967 this is about making sure that older australians retain their independence and ensuring their quality of life
6239968 this is also about preparing for the challenges of the 21 st century and responding to the needs of australias ageing population
6239969 there is quite some concern in the community particularly among young people about mobile premium services
6239970 the accc fields quite a lot of complaints from consumers who have been confused or misled by certain marketing techniques surrounding mobile premium services
6239971 at times the lack of proper disclosure of terms and conditions may mislead consumers in breach of the trade practices act
6239972 the new factsheet is a timely reminder of what to look out for before a consumer requests these types of services
6239973 there is an industry scheme in place regulating the provision of mobile premium services active steps are being taken to review this and the government encourages industry to continue this work
6239974 the minister for broadband communications and the digital economy senator stephen conroy has already publicly warned that industry needs to address these issues quickly and effectively or the government will have little choice but to explore alternative regulatory options
6239975 she might be able to sell her fish and buy some antibiotics

6239977 i look forward to the commonwealth cape york land council and queensland working together native title allows flexibility and we must all now embrace that opportunity
6239978 settling wider issues at the same time as settling native title claims can be a better outcome for all the parties involved
6239979 we will ensure all the other respondent parties interests are acknowledged and that the government and applicant parties keep them informed of progress
6239980 the traditional owners of the area have matters that they want to see improved in the township and outside of the town on their traditional lands
6239981 all the parties in native title will benefit from negotiating broader outcomes
6239982 if this approach proves successful it may have application in other regions of the state

6239990 the introduction of a seasonal worker scheme has been at the top of the agenda for many pacific island leaders
6239991 it has also been a key objective of australian farmers and growers
6239992 the rudd government has listened to the evidence and taken decisive action to introduce a pilot scheme that is a win win for both australias farming communities and our close neighbours across the pacific
6239993 in just over nine months the rudd labor government has fundamentally reformed australias relationship with the pacific with a range of practical measures and active diplomacy
6239994 this pilot scheme along with the prime ministers attendance this week at the pacific leaders forum in niue provides yet more evidence of the importance the rudd government places on its closest region
6239995 how the health revolution will impact on the growing ageing population
6239996 this is about protecting the frail and aged in our community accreditation of australias nursing homes is about the health welfare safety and well being of residents
6239997 the overwhelming majority of aged care providers are providing top quality care for our nations elderly in every state and territory i have seen world class facilities but i have also seen areas where improvement is needed
6239998 they are backed by hard working dedicated staff in fact a number of matters about resident safety have been brought to the australian governments attention by nursing home staff concerned about residents
6239999 for the past 12 years the previous government neglected nursing homes and neglected our older australians we plan to change that
