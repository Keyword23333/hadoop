7150006 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines

7150026 as quoted by reuters from a statement on the departure of u
7150027 the correct statement is that the departure of all troops from iraq would be subject to the requirements of national security iraqi and iraqi government sees the need for the existence of these forces or not in agreement with the u s administration that will later be determined jointly
7150028 the two sides had agreed to withdraw troops from iraq end in 2011
7150029 the two sides had agreed on the withdrawal of all combat units cities by june 2009

7150065 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7150066 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7150067 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7150068 magandang opportunity sana para sa amin ni bea na ma pair sa iba para naman hindi kami nagiging dependent sa isat isa
7150069 it would help sana kung napanood ko yung any of the betty la fea series pero hindi eh kaya magdi depend na lamang ako sa director pero kapag nagkaroon ako ng time talagang papanoorin ko ito
7150070 siguro dahil bukod sa guwapo ako ay napaka sincere ko sa trabaho ko from the last naging open ako nagtapat at hindi nanloko to protect my career i even admitted my relationship with ciara sotto kahit magkaiba kami ng company

7150076 paano ngarag ngarag ako sa taping ng dyosa where i play three different characters tapos im shooting baler pa kaya puyat at pagod talaga but im not complaining nagpapasalamat nga akot hindi ako nababakante at lagi akong may project happy rin ako dahil in when love begins si christopher de leon ang father ko and now sa baler si phillip salvador naman it feels great to be acting with the best drama actors in our country
7150077 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7150078 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7150079 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7150080 our rules that were just clarified say that our delegation will vote for the national convention candidate who received the most votes in the primary
7150081 if that candidate is john mccain that is who they are bound to vote for
7150082 encourage all released and uncommitted delegates to cast their votes for sen john mccain at the convention
7150083 the decision today had nothing to do with personality and has everything to do with simply interpreting an ambiguity in our rules
7150084 the state delegates overwhelmingly wanted our utah delegation to vote for romney it was pretty clear
7150085 so my intent was to follow the will of utah voters and the will of the utah state delegates

7150092 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7150093 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7150094 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7150095 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7150096 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7150097 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you

7150112 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq and conversely if iraq were transported to mars does anyone think there would not be terrorism visited upon the israelis every day
7150113 so lets get it straight israel is not the cause of iraq iraq being settled or not settled has nothing to do with israels conduct

7150121 i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind we have before us many many months of struggle and suffering
7150122 our extraordinary housing boom financed by very large increases in mortgage debt cannot continue indefinitely into the future
7150123 only when the tide goes out do you discover whos been swimming naked
7150124 this is an epic event were talking about the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 2007
7150125 before the us economy can truly begin to expand again the savings rate must rise to pre bubble levels of 8pc that the us housing stocks must fall to below eight months supply and that the household interest coverage ratio must fall from 14pc to 10 5pc
7150126 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there
7150127 we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations although our management believes that the incurrence of long term indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business
7150128 interest expense for 3 months ending june 30 2008 was 312 943 000 net income for 3 months ending june 30 2008 was 34 082 000 earnings per share from continuing operations was 01 earnings per share from discontinued operations was 12 if the cost to refinance 18 billion were to rise to 8 0 interest expense would rise by 50 to a whopping 469 414 000 per quarter even 7 would be a killer based on the numbers presented above

7150131 theres a lot of revenue thats made that you cant argue is illegal but fees dont have to be as high as they are
7150132 people feel they have to be nice and that if they upset the person across the table they wont get anything
7150133 a whole industry has grown up making money off families money
7150134 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7150135 most of this is through their management who regard fees as the most important part of the business rather than delivering service or looking after clients
7150136 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month
7150137 the key thing here is we dont charge for work that hasnt been completed
7150138 theres no question that we are a commercial organisation and we have shareholders and we intend to make a profit thats nothing to be ashamed about
7150139 in public trust we did see a real shift from an organisation that was very client centric to very much a revenue and profit driven organisation
7150140 trustee corporations would be similar to any other corporate where the powers that be the executives set their budgets for the organisation and have various ways to cascade that down
7150141 as long as i am chief executive we will never progress to the point of incentivising or creating the expectation of not selling to need
7150142 like many things in new zealand it has been left unattended for a long time
7150143 are estate companies better than each other i dont know but there needs to be a commission of inquiry a full shake out of trust and estate management in new zealand
7150144 is there a problem the fact you sunday star times
7150145 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7150146 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7150147 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7150148 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7150149 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much
7150150 what we know is very limited to a very skewed sample because these are just the guys who get caught
7150151 as a prosecutor i dont really need to know why
7150152 for every one of these people we take down were intervening in preventing child abuse
7150153 the elements are very easy for the government to prove
7150154 there is nothing about prosecuting the bernie wards of the world that is going to stop the east european exploiters from marketing this stuff
7150155 we ran well again last week you know and we ran well at watkins glen so thats three where we ran pretty well well just keep pushing
7150156 its appropriate that we had the call of duty game on the gamestop car tonight because it certainly was a war out there we started in the back and worked on our car and started working our way to the front and finally got some decent track position ive got to hand it to all the guys who worked hard back at the shop and here at the track to get our cars ready to race
7150157 we just got caught up in one of those bristol messes
7150158 i dont know what happened in front of me they started checking up and i think someone got loose in front of denny and he checked up and i ran into the back of him i had nowhere to go on that i was just in the wrong place at the wrong time its too bad because we were in a position to get a great finish out of it
7150159 i think if we started up front and got the track position we needed we probably wouldve had a top five car
7150160 the gamestop guys worked hard but we just started behind the eight ball and never got back in front of it everyone in this organization stepped up this week and im proud how this whole team came in here wanting to win more than ever
7150161 our car was really good since we unloaded it off the truck today our camping world chevy has been really good the last few weeks and got the finish to show for it and got the pole earlier hopefully we can go to memphis when i drive again and get a win and im pretty sure kevin harvick his car owner will get us a couple before the year is out
7150162 oh its big i mean you come to a racetrack like bristol its known as not one of the easiest tracks and obviously im really excited about it and hopefully itll pay off for me next year when we get to run a little bit more hopefully ive really enjoyed with kevin and delana the last couple of years its been an awesome ride
7150163 yeah not too bad smiles we were able to stay up front most of the night and stay out of most of the trouble and a lot of fun racing out there i tell ya you run two wide pretty easy its a lot of fun
7150164 it was really good all weekend we unloaded this morning and the car was good qualified good and ran up front all night we really had a good time with our camping world chevrolet its the same car that i run at orp and it seems to be doing pretty good
7150165 i feel like i was a little bit better on the longer runs the real long run the shorter runs were getting me just a little bit but i think that comes with experience and hopefully well get to do more races where we can maybe get a win before too long
7150166 that was a pretty cool race but we needed to do better than that to win raybestos rookie of the year and i think thats our goal right now its achievable so we just have to get back in the swing of good races and i think we can do it the national guard chevy was good all night we had the 196th with us this weekend and cam strader crew chief did a great job it could have been a lot worse
7150167 that last set again were struggling with tightness and it was making it difficult and then the 22 car he was racing me like it was for the win and he was a lap down absolutely gave me no room whatsoever and that really hurt us stremme did a better job getting through the traffic and that was it and i got freight trained after that i pushed the front fender in trying to get past the 22 and that got us tight it was a real shame those last 15 laps because the fastenal guys did a good job all day and as i say apart from the 22 car i had a great time out there
7150168 im just driving as hard as i can i mean kevin and delana have given me an awesome opportunity the last couple of years to drive for them and well see the way the sponsorship deals pan out and everything obviously were looking for sponsors for next year to try to finalize some things but i think kevin and delana are going to keep me around obviously i want to race full time but im getting an opportunity a lot of guys dont get i race my 13 races or however many races that kevin and delana want to give me its been a lot of fun and ive learned a lot im a part of kevin harvick incorporated and it feels really good to come out and perform for myself and also for them and my team and my sponsors
7150169 cale is going a really good job we were really fast off the truck this morning and hes starting to get a good feel for these race cars now he could even feel two clicks in a shock adjustment today he could feel a half a pound of air pressure in practice because i did quite a few things based off what we did with the truck the other night hes a young guy so i keep moving things until he feels it like ill move the track bar just so he can start learning he did a really good job tonight he didnt spin the tires on restarts weve got to work on his restarts a little bit but at least he didnt spin the tires and stuff and he raced with some really good guys and he didnt roll over when the boxed him in im real proud of him i think he done a really good job for a young guy its pretty intimidating to be at bristol
7150170 thats the thing thats what kevin and i have talked about we think he has really good potential because he hasnt had much seat time you know these last few races hes gone to he out to be turning some heads because the kids got some talent he builds our shocks at the shop hes really smart about race cars its just kind of fun to work with him
7150171 mens wearhouse is proud to partner with roth racing limited and sponsor the no 25 car marty roth began his racing career in the 1970s and that is when mens wearhouse first began helping men like the way they look this year mens wearhouse is celebrating our 35th anniversary and were thrilled to reach that milestone and race well beyond it with the help of marty and the great team at roth racing we thank all of our customers for our success over the past 35 years and look forward to serving them for years to come i guarantee it
7150172 its an amazing weekend it was a new track again and we were really good we tried to catch raphael matos in the qualifying he tested here last weekend so he had a better chance of being good than us so its good that we got the pole we had a good race the car was consistent we didnt have to push it 100 percent it was good to have a race like that
7150173 it was a good race were trying to maximize the points as much as we can this weekend its important that we come out of this weekend with a real chance at the championship were leading the championship by one point so its a good thing richard antinucci finished behind me unfortunately we didnt have enough for franck perera but it was a good race and well make improvements for tomorrow
7150174 we had that great start but unfortunately i had to give way rules are rules i was just following my line and my row on the start we had a better start than the other line with raphael matos on the front row i had to let him by so i let him by i dropped one spot at the end of lap 1 in a weird way and let him by we had good speed at the end i think were there and well make improvements for sunday
7150175 it went well we definitely made some gains in the car particularly at the beginning of the race we definitely had the speed of the guys up front and then as we started getting into the race the front tires just started going off so that was affecting me on the brakes particularly in some of the slower corners i was having a tough time keeping up i fell into the trap of either youre overdriving it a little bit or youre just a little bit slow that was a fine line that i crossed over a little bit too far a couple of times that allowed logan gomez to catch back up a little bit but well make a couple of changes here and i think well have a really good run tomorrow
7150176 we qualified fourth which is a season best for guthrie racing weve got izod on the car for this race so i think its some good luck it was good to qualify fourth weve just got to stay up there i ran into some trouble with another competitor who passed before the green flag you cant do much once theyre by you and then youve got to pass them i ended up making a pass on track for fifth again it was just a tough race well see where the inversion goes and see where well be starting tomorrow there wasnt much passing in the race so maybe we can start up front
7150177 the guys did an incredible job moving past the fire turning the page and moving forward if there is a team that can rebound its team penske they proved it today were happy with every accomplishment that weve made this weekend starting on the front row is big for us were going to continue working hard tomorrow and hopefully have a good finish
7150178 its been pretty clear we have really fast cars on the road courses i think apart from st petersburg weve had the front row every time its been really good also between helio castroneves and myself we really push each other a lot too and thats a big bonus having two really fast cars on these tracks we compare the data after every session and ill pick up a bit where hes strong and hell pick up a bit where im strong and we just try to put it all together so i think that really helps too its great to have team penske sweep the front row again
7150179 its good we carried it through weve sort of been there all weekend in the top three were happy about that i think i could have done a better job in that last run but it does feel good theyre very long races we know its a lot about strategy a lot of yellows fall in this race were just happy weve got two cars up there were doing well
7150180 we were one change behind in the firestone fast six we tried everything and as a team weve come a long way weve been struggling on the road courses so im glad to see were in the top four at infineon you dont want to start worse than the second row
7150181 i think were probably disappointed with our qualifying the car was fairly decent and then on that last qualifying run we tried to lower the car a lot to see if we were just missing and every time i tried to touch the brakes i was locking them up and we couldnt even get within eight tenths of a second of our last run it was worth a try i think we would have only been one spot better maybe in fourth we just didnt have enough for what those two penske cars had we always seem to race a little bit better and were definitely happy with where were at we just have to make sure we can follow up with some points tomorrow
7150182 we had a great first two sessions and i was really happy with the car but at the end we made a mistake with the pressures and the car was sliding all over plus the track got hotter and i just couldnt stay close i think we had a chance to put in a good lap at the end at least to beat scott dixon but i waited a little too long to get a gap and i didnt get to make a run just a terrible session but im happy that the car was good in the first two sessions and were in good position for the race
7150183 im disappointed that we didnt make the firestone fast six for the first time this season i thought we had the potential the mcdonalds car was quick but just a little difficult to drive it was right on the edge all the way around so we couldnt quite put a lap together i think we have the performance to gain some spots but i dont think this track lends itself to overtaking well just have to have a smart race stay out of trouble and keep picking them off one at a time maybe we can overtake but its only if somebody makes a mistake weve seen a lot of people go off around here its a tough track the better your car is the more fuel you can save and the more chance you have of passing people in the pit s we just need to make sure the car is good tomorrow morning in the warm up
7150184 were not where we want to be because i think anything other than being in the firestone fast six is a disappointment but the guys did a great job on the car and i think we can race from here tomorrow the engineering staff turned a 14th place car into an eighth place one overnight and we had something for the rest of the field until we got to the slow speed sections of the track we were as fast as anyone in the first half of the lap and i think we could have caused some trouble but we just didnt have the whole package today well work on it some more and get it tomorrow
7150185 it was great that the motorola car was able to make it into the fast 12 i cant believe how close the times were of course i wish that we would have been able to make it into the firestone fast six but we are headed in the right direction hopefully we can keep the car up front and out of trouble throughout the race
7150186 i had my hands full in qualifying today the car was on the edge of grip at both ends we made one little change and we completely tipped the car over from understeer to oversteer it wasnt our best effort today and we would be happier if we were starting a bit higher on the grid the blockbuster star clone years race car is very good though so were confident heading into tomorrow
7150187 i was tickled to death regardless of what happens to this point we made a few changes and honestly it didnt feel that much quicker but you can be a tenth one way or the other here i had to feather it a little bit off of four because i got just a little hung out but it was a good solid lap i thought maybe thatll be ok but well see
7150188 its frustrating but everybody else is frustrated too so you cant kick them down too bad
7150189 we just have to keep digging all we can do is try to take our z line toyota home and build on it for next year and try to make it better
7150190 its not what we wanted but we got spots at the end to get a top 10

7150199 biden ha denunciado la d bil capacidad de juicio de obama en materia de pol tica exterior y ha reafirmado con sus propias palabras lo que los americanos est n a punto de comprobar que barack obama no est preparado para ser presidente
7150200 este asunto hace aflorar discrepancias que est n sobre la mesa desde 2002 puede tener consecuencias muy serias para occidente mosc es un socio fundamental en casi todas las prioridades internacionales ir n crisis energ tica terrorismo nuclear
7150201 la ampliaci n de la otan tiene como precio la enemistad de mosc
7150202 en mi opini n es un error es una cinta de transmisi n de problemas desde el este hacia el coraz n del oeste creo que en t rminos estrat gicos ser a enormemente m s rentable apostar por una buena cooperaci n con el kremlin que desgastar esa relaci n para anclar a ciertos pa ses en la rbita occidental mosc es demasiado relevante

7150205 mosc ha logrado su objetivo advertir a occidente de que no acepta su pol tica y a los pa ses vecinos de que tengan mucho cuidado
7150206 ahora lo previsible es que reconduzca su conducta dentro de cauces menos agresivos que s lo provocar an un acercamiento de posiciones dentro de la otan y deje a occidente frente a sus contradicciones

7150209 lo que me preocupa es que en ee uu el debate p blico ha sido poco plural y los aspirantes a la casa blanca se han empleado en competir sobre qui n lanzaba las amenazas m s duras contra rusia

7150213 he needs to come to my face and tell me im not a person then the cops will have a reason to be here because he doesnt have that right
7150214 obamas decision to choose him is an exceptionally good choice that shows that obama is trying to unite all democrats behind him
7150215 bidens nomination is obamas attempt to balance his small foreign policy experience when compared to republican presidential candidate john mccain
7150216 this can lead to tension within obamas campaign which has been promoting a change away from the establishment
7150217 should obama win the election there will be a different foreign policy thanks to biden than the one under a republican mccain

7150358 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

7150361 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights

7150374 as a direct result of fr terrys actions numerous e mails regarding the propriety of that action came to our office
7150375 fr terry was called into our office to explain his actions and we pointed out to him that based on canon law at no time is any of our clergy to be part of or deemed to be associated with any political party except in the judgement of the eparchial bishop if a particular law so states the need to protect the rights of the church or to promote the common good requires it
7150376 it was also acknowledged that by promoting mr ignatieff that indirectly he was promoting the political stance on abortion and gay rights legislation that the candidate has
7150377 fr terry has been reprimanded and a letter to all clergy informing them of the current statutes and regulations regarding involvement in any political process will be sent and reinforced

7150381 im confident the university will deal with the question of a public representative making declarations that are inconsistent with the catholic faith
7150382 when you take a position in a catholic university you dont have to embrace everything the catholic church teaches but you cant make statements which call into question that identity and mission of the catholic church
7150383 we are grateful to archbishop burke for his example and leadership
7150384 his call for disciplinary action is entirely consistent with vatican principles for catholic universities sadly st louis university has repeatedly violated those principles
7150385 the catholic bishops of the united states in their 2004 document
7150386 our catholic institutions must promote the clear understanding of our deep moral convictions on an issue like abortion an act that the church calls an unspeakable crime and a non negotiable issue
7150387 a catholic must order their values according to a hierarchy of values and at the top of that hierarchy is the dignity of human life
7150388 that descriptor lgbt was not possible on church property we suggested they shift it change the nature of it a little bit and they did
7150389 the reason is quite simply because it was a lgbt pride prayer service and that is really inimical to the teachings of the catholic church
7150390 by steadfastly choosing to be pro choice a catholic politician or not excludes himself or herself from communion
7150391 arrogantly insist that the church does not have the right to her own teaching
7150392 the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion
7150393 having made every effort to inform and to persuade governor sebelius and after consultation with bishop ron gilmore dodge city bishop paul coakley salina and bishop michael jackels wichita i wrote the governor last august requesting that she refrain from presenting herself for reception of the eucharist until she had acknowledged the error of her past positions made a worthy sacramental confession and taken the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion
7150394 recently it came to my attention that the governor had received holy communion at one of our parishes
7150395 i have written to her again asking her to respect my previous request and not require from me any additional pastoral actions

7150398 the quintessential liberal fascist isnt an ss storm trooper it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from brown or swarthmore
7150399 this featured quote tells you all you need about the quality of the research that went into this book
7150400 and others who would wail how can he call teachers nazis what an idiot and not only is that idiotic but brown amp swarthmore dont offer educational degrees this is the level of pure lie and idiocy that typifies this book lies dont bother reading it i certainly wont
7150401 what is this mythical principles the founders didnt agree on everything there is no source to return to
7150402 but every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle we have been called by different names brethren of the same principle we are all republicans we are all federalists
7150403 religious views are a matter of private conscience and no public authority has a right to interfere in how it is exercised
7150404 of atheism it is true that a little philosophy inclineth mans mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth mens minds about to religion for while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to providence and deity
7150405 but it did mean that it was understood to be improper for such actions to be taken without first having given the people a voice in the process of designing and enacting laws that might interfere and coerce them the phrase no taxation without representation

7150407 the foundation of authority is laid firstly in the free consent of the people
7150408 the choice of public magistrates belongs unto he people by gods own allowance
7150409 they who have the power to appoint officers and magistrates it is in their power also to set the bounds and limitations of the power and place unto which they call them
7150410 there is great division of judgment in matters of religion amongst good ministers amp people which moved mr

7150412 united for the general preservation of their lives liberties and estates which i call by the general name property
7150413 by property i must be understood here as in other places to mean that property which men have in their persons as well as goods
7150414 for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure by entering into society and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the people who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience and are left to the common refuge which god hath provided for all men against force and violence
7150415 human knowledge and human power meet in one for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced nature to be commanded must be obeyed and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule
7150416 these principles may flourish and triumph in the schools where it is indeed difficult if not impossible to refute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determined sceptic in the same condition as other mortals
7150417 let there be therefore and may it be for the benefit of both two streams and two dispensations of knowledge and in like manner two tribes or kindreds of students in philosophy tribes not hostile or alien to each other but bound together by mutual services let there in short be one method for the cultivation another for the invention of knowledge

7150421 222 the reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property and the end why they choose and authorize a legislative is that there may be laws made and rules set as guards and fences to the properties of all the members of the society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every part and member of the society
7150422 well its everyones duty especially those with more to sacrifice for the community
7150423 at the time of his graduation from william and mary jefferson was eighteen durin the two preceding impressionable years he had been under the tutelage of professor small and had been well grounded in the ethics commonly taught at the colleges in those days we have no theses from william and mary because of the fire but the ethical theses that are available from the four colleges harvard yale princeton and brown are all sufficiently alike to make it clear that they represent the moral philosophy teaching of the time under ethics or politics at most of the colleges they defended the proposition that authority for government devolved originally on the people and was by them transferred to the ruler if he did not rule for the benefit of his people they had a right to remove him and substitute another this is the teaching that was in many minds at that time as the result of their college theses and it was this that was incorporated in the declaration of independence the source of whose theory of government must be found in this ethical philosophy that was the common teaching of all the colonial colleges and had for centuries been the teaching of the universities generally unless they were under royal influence
7150424 he determined that little is gained by teaching the child his sounds and letters as the first step to being able to read since individuals could recognize words very rapidly the way to teach children how to read was to show them words and tell them what the words were
7150425 how do we know what to do if we dont have any ism to guide us ah he knows follow him
7150426 i have therefore found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith
7150427 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
7150428 he who dares to undertake the making of a peoples institutions ought to feel himself capable so to speak of changing human nature of transforming each individual who is by himself a complete and solitary whole into part of a greater whole from which he in a manner receives his life and being of altering mans constitution for the purpose of strengthening it and of substituting a partial and moral existence for the physical and independent existence nature has conferred on us all
7150429 to the right understanding of any arguments that may be adduced under this head it is requisite that we should have a clear idea of the meaning of the term necessity he who affirms that all actions are necessary means that if we form a just and complete view of all the circumstances in which a living or intelligent being is placed we shall find that he could not in any moment of his existence have acted otherwise than he has acted according to this assertion there is in the transactions of mind nothing loose precarious and uncertain upon this question the advocate of liberty in the philosophical sense must join issue he must if he mean any thing deny this certainty of conjunction between moral antecedents and consequents where all is constant and invariable and the events that arise uniformly flow from the circumstances in which they originate there can be no liberty
7150430 it has appeared that the idea of necessary connexion between events of any sort is the lesson of experience and the vulgar never arrive at the universal application of this principle even to the phenomena of the material universe in the easiest and most familiar instances such as the impinging of one ball of matter upon another and its consequences they willingly admit the interference of chance or an event uncaused in this instance however as both the impulse and its effects are subjects of observation to the senses they readily imagine that they perceive the absolute principle which causes motion to be communicated from the first ball to the second now the very same prejudice and precipitate conclusion which induce them to believe that they discover the principle of motion in objects of sense act in an opposite direction with respect to such objects as cannot be subjected to the examination of sense the manner in which an idea or proposition suggested to the mind of a percipient being produces animal motion they never see and therefore readily conclude that there is no necessary connexion between these events
7150431 but if the vulgar will universally be found to be the advocates of free will they are not less strongly however inconsistently impressed with the belief of the doctrine of necessity it is a well known and a just observation that were it not for the existence of general laws to which the events of the material universe always conform man could never have been either a reasoning or a moral being
7150432 book iv chap v it must be unnecessary to add any thing farther on this head unless it be a momentary recollection of the sort of benefit that freedom of the will would confer upon us supposing it to be possible man being as we have now found him to be a simple substance governed by the apprehensions of his understanding nothing farther is requisite but the improvement of his reasoning faculty to make him virtuous and happy but did he possess a faculty independent of the understanding and capable of resisting from mere caprice the most powerful arguments the best education and the most sedulous instruction might be of no use to him this freedom we shall easily perceive to be his bane and his curse and the only hope of lasting benefit to the species would be by drawing closer the connexion between the external motions and the understanding wholly to extirpate it the virtuous man in proportion to his improvement will be under the constant influence of fixed and invariable principles and such a being as we conceive god to be can never in any one instance have exercised this liberty that is can never of no service to morality have acted in a foolish and tyrannical manner freedom of the will is absurdly represented as necessary to render the mind susceptible of moral principles but in reality so far as we act with liberty so far as we are independent of motives our conduct is as independent of morality as it is of reason nor is it possible that we should deserve either praise or blame for a proceeding thus capricious and indisciplinable
7150433 but did he possess a faculty independent of the understanding and capable of resisting from mere caprice the most powerful arguments the best education and the most sedulous instruction might be of no use to him
7150434 man being as we have now found him to be a simple substance governed by the apprehensions of his understanding nothing farther is requisite but the improvement of his reasoning faculty to make him virtuous and happy
7150435 well its everyones duty especially those with more to sacrifice for the community
7150436 by thinking on the real through discernment between the permanent and the illusory the mental substance of consciousness though unstable and forever shifting can be converted into a profound and undisturbed awareness of the true the good and the beautiful and as the consciousness of these grows in the soul then their reality absorbs the substance of consciousness transforming it and redeeming it
7150437 well gee i really like this small painting in the window
7150438 we spent most of our time looking at and discussing

7150440 i have a huge passion for downtown and have lived downtown all my life
7150441 i think having a big event in town is fantastic for many reasons it draws the spotlight to our great little historic downtown

7150443 its been fun to see some of the smaller start up businesses courted for our skyway and street level spaces

7150453 have you ever felt you werent being told the truth
7150454 i talked to a clinton delegate here in maryland he told me they have been instructed to vote for hillary for president on the first ballot to make things more interesting there is a movement to swing 160 delegates from obama to clinton if that happens clinton could re establish her campaign and face john mccain in the fall
7150455 the group p u m a for public unity my a claims that 15 delegates have switched from obama to clinton in july there is still the possibility of a floor convention vote to fully seat the delegations from michigan and florida which would benefit senator clinton
7150456 the question is will it be an easy nomination for obama or one of the grandest political ambushes ever pulled off on the voting floor of the convention
7150457 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7150458 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7150459 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7150460 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7150461 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

7150474 many indigenous people believe that uranium is buried in the world because it is evil and it is for a very good reason that it should stay buried
7150475 indigenous peoples can provide a strong foundation for the rest of the world we believe in shared economies
7150476 this is a convergence of information and political strategy to confront industrialization and the role of multinational corporations that are infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples we reaffirm the utilization of our indigenous traditional knowledge and cosmo vision around specific issues of mineral extraction energy climate globalization and toxic contamination

7150480 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7150481 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything

7150492 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7150493 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7150494 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7150495 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7150496 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7150497 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7150498 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected

7150519 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7150535 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7150536 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7150537 although its not a done deal the idea of obama choosing joe biden as his running mate is kind of like getting underwear for christmas you know that you can use it but its not exactly what you were hoping for
7150538 obama never vetted hillary or asked either bill or hillary for their advice
7150539 its a given that the rs will attack joebama as the candidates that will talk everyone to death

7150542 just as party leaders pack their bags for denver our latest reuters zogby poll finds their nominee in some trouble interestingly obamas margins among what had been his strongest demographic groups dropped by as much as 12 points these include democrats women city dwellers and younger voters those ages 25 34 also obama has lost his lead among the swing catholic vote dropping 11 points to mccain over a month
7150543 obamas willingness to anoint a senator who voted for two landmark travesties the bankruptcy bill and iraq war gives us some disturbing clues about the illinois senators attitude toward the economic progressive movement and the antiwar movement it also shows how much work those movements have in front of them and how in particular the antiwar movements strategy of focusing all attention on republicans has actually helped create the situation whereby the democratic party feels perfectly comfortable rewarding supposed serious foreign policy voices like biden even after they voted for the war

7150553 he conversado con ni as abusadas en el contexto de la iglesia y sus padres no les cre an cuenta si bien los niveles de abuso suelen ser un poco m s bajos en las iglesias que en otros mbitos el silencio suele ser mucho mayor

7150685 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that

7150687 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7150688 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly

7150691 still the new building has its own kitchen and many of the same facilities as the main building the only difference is the amenities in the new building are dedicated to the needs of the academy
7150692 the new building also allows local communities to maintain involvement with the cobham grounds as they play weekend matches there as well as permitting the academys management structure and football in the communitys 136 coaches to work alongside one another

7150696 we were pretty disappointed with our record early in the season and we knew we were a lot better team on defence than we had shown
7150697 it was up to us to change that to make no excuses to get out there and do it it was about everyone buying in
7150698 theyve adapted to the conditions very well and it looks as though they have done a lot of work on their defence and come up with some pretty sound tactics they seem a pretty happy side and they want to work for each other the introduction of some young players with self motivation and energy has really helped
7150699 it used to remind me of a holiday station the way it was earlier in the year if they carry on the same way today as they have been doing you will see the markers playing a far more significant role
7150700 one noticeable change is how the players are on the balls of their feet in the defensive line theyve gone from being flat footed and thats nothing but attitude
7150701 we havent worried over the last eight weeks about what others are doing if you did youd be in a bit of trouble

7150788 there are two major and regrettably common mistakes augustine wants us to avoid one is the lure of utopianism the mistake of thinking we can produce a society that will solve our problems and bring about the kingdom of god on earth this was the basic error of both marxism and 19th century liberalism my observation think new christian left the other error equally disastrous is cynicism this creeps upon us as we see ever present evil we withdraw into our own self contained circle of contentment which can just as well be a pious holy huddle as a secular skeptics club

7150798 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics
7150799 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7150800 they will never be in charge of the nations affairs
7150801 they can say and do anything and not be accountable for it whereas the opposition has a responsibility to the wider community because they could conceivably be the government
7150802 the only reason that the minor parties votes even matter is because dr nelson and the liberal party are trying to take an axe to the budget
7150803 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election
7150804 if youre fighting inflation the last thing you do is increase taxes on alcohol cars software and other functions of business
7150805 the responsibility of the government is to do everything it can to drive confidence in the business community
7150806 around 400 000 australians didnt vote for the major parties in the senate they voted differently between the lower and upper houses so basically senates do have a watchdog role

7150808 we are on the frontlines of genocidal environmental attack by major corporations like conoco phillips continental carbon black and ponca cities landfill they are poisoning the air the water the earth and all connecting relatives such as animals plants fish and rivers indigenous peoples have outlived centuries of abuse we have the strength the knowledge and the courage to survive

7150812 many indigenous people believe that uranium is buried in the world because it is evil and it is for a very good reason that it should stay buried
7150813 indigenous peoples can provide a strong foundation for the rest of the world we believe in shared economies
7150814 this is a convergence of information and political strategy to confront industrialization and the role of multinational corporations that are infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples we reaffirm the utilization of our indigenous traditional knowledge and cosmo vision around specific issues of mineral extraction energy climate globalization and toxic contamination
7150815 well brian i think looking back there is something to be said for the idea that i will be a better president now than frankly i would have been four years ago
7150816 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7150817 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7150818 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7150819 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7150820 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7150821 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7150822 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote

7150827 a final concern related to the ongoing rise in the airs co2 concentration is the worry that it may lead to catastrophic global warming there is little reason to believe that such will ever occur however for several observations of historical changes in atmospheric co2 concentration and air temperature suggest that it is climate change that drives changes in the airs co2 content and not vice versa in a study of the global warmings that signaled the demise of the last three ice ages for example fischer et al 1999 found that air temperature always rose first followed by an increase in atmospheric co2 some 400 to 1000 years later likewise petit et al 1999 found that for all of the glacial inceptions of the past half million years air temperature consistently dropped before the airs co2 content did and that the co2 decreases lagged the temperature decreases by several thousand years in addition the multiple degree centigrade rapid warmings and subsequent slower coolings that occurred over the course of the start and stop demise of the last great ice age are typically credited with causing the minor co2 concentration changes that followed them staufer et al 1998 and there are a number of other studies that demonstrate a complete uncoupling of atmospheric co2 and air temperature during periods of significant climate change cheddadi et al 1998 gagan et al 1998 raymo et al 1998 indermuhle et al 1999 hence there are no historical analogues for co2 induced climate change but there are many examples of climate change induced co2
7150828 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7150829 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7150830 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7150831 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7150832 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7150833 faith based because there is absolutely nothing that shows humans can or are affecting climate with co2 production

7150844 i think having a big event in town is fantastic for many reasons it draws the spotlight to our great little historic downtown
7150845 it gives everyone a chance to put on a great coat of paint and were seeing agencies work together like never before to accomplish the best possible hosted environment
7150846 its been fun to see some of the smaller start up businesses courted for our skyway and street level spaces
7150847 serving as a conduit for getting information to the community
7150848 we have incredible volunteers who have put over 1 500 hours into crc in the past year
7150849 we could not have the kind of committee contributions and overall presence without our great board members and volunteer friends

7150866 it gives us work but the one single concern for most people is logs going out of this area we do not want that to happen
7150867 stuart lake lumber looks like it might be starting up again and pope and talbots been sold
7150868 i want to drive i want to work i dont want to be on uic
7150869 we need help from the government because to ban raw logs means to save jobs for fort st james or surrounding area
7150870 lets face it big companies will do whatever it takes to transport logs
7150871 were facing perhaps the toughest challenge we as a community and perhaps as a province have ever faced i want to recognize the positive attitude and the dogged persistence of the public its because of that that we are going to weather the storm and were going to make it through these challenges
7150872 ive always said for a city its size its food scene is incredibly strong i look at pittsburgh and minneapolis and they dont have near the amount of independent chef driven restaurants that you could really put anywhere in the country clevelanders and people in northeast ohio are really blessed and finally people are starting to recognize this

7150885 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7150886 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home

7150923 societies near the traditional pole emphasize the importance of parent child ties and deference to authority along with absolute standards and traditional family values and reject divorce abortion euthanasia and suicide these societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook societies with secular rational values have the opposite preferences on all of these topics

7150927 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7150928 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7150929 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7150930 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7150931 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7150932 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7150933 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7150934 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7150935 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7150936 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7150937 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7150938 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7150939 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7150947 at the hotel we discovered that there were already 48 russian journalists there together with us there were 50 people
7150948 i was the only one representing a foreign news agency the rest were from russian media and they arrived three days before we did as if they knew that something was going to happen earlier at the border crossing we met one man who was taking his wife and children from tskhinvali
7150949 the rhetoric that is coming out of moscow ethnic cleansing and genocide is just way over the top
7150950 its almost approaching the point where there is just no relationship to reality but again certainly the rhetoric is appropriate to a larger operation against georgia to just stop and reverse whatever military gains the georgians made in south ossetia on august 7
7150951 we have complaints against the osce regarding the initial stage of the conflict they were informed by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but they didnt warn the russian peacekeepers
7150952 the georgian leadership made a mistake on august 7 they should have understood from what they have seen from the russians that the russians were looking for a pretext they the georgians gave them that pretext when they decided to go in a fairly large way into south ossetia
7150953 the speed of the russian response suggests that the russians were ready they were just waiting for the reason and they took that as the reason
7150954 theres no such thing as a dumb question only stupid people

7150957 are you serious you have got to be kidding where the hell are you hearing this
7150958 well my brother says it and hes smoked pot for 10 years now and my friends who got me started on it say it and then the studies that no one has ever seen say it too
7150959 you are serious okay how to put this your brother is a total fat ass who still lives with your mom and steals from her purse to buy his weed
7150960 the reason no one has seen those studies is because they dont exist theyre a hoax

7150968 we want to do something for the children and the men and women that fight for our freedoms the nwwl offers a substantial media platform to create awareness
7150969 everybody is talking about the sort of notable players the guys who have played ryder cup before who are not on the team
7150970 ian is one monty is the other darren clarke for example and they have to be my rivals when it comes to a pick
7150971 im sure azinger has a notion one way or the other whether im going to be on that team or not and if i play well its just going to help my cause and if not it may add some doubt
7150972 im just going to have to try to block that all out
7150973 ive said all along i want the guy that makes birdies
7150974 i told paul he needs to go to the list everybody knows our stats on tour and the ryder cup is about making birdies
7150975 i made a mistake and learned from it and try to move on from it
7150976 i talked to the right people and clarified everything and got everything out in the open with them
7150977 my fathers life has been documented in many ways and i have always appreciated those who painstakingly sought to tell his story accurately
7150978 two simple examples producers would refer to as creative license
7150979 i asked for an interview with dr bob in his office and told him about my discontent and my thoughts of leaving
7150980 his voice booming he pronounced me a failure and predicted only more failure ahead
7150981 he felt there was not sufficient treatment of his father preaching and when he was preaching it was watered down
7150982 he told her there are some inaccuracies in the film which she doesnt dispute
7150983 she can do what she wants but shes not representing the billy graham evangelistic association nor would she say she is
7150984 why are all of you white people so racist just because he is black
7150985 there is information that 20 girls from 15 to 20 years left for the forest in chechnya
7150986 people didnt accept the aid and started throwing stones at the soldiers saying the afghan army is our enemy we dont want anything from our enemies
7150987 we will continue our demonstration until the international community listen to us and bring those who carried out yesterdays attack to justice
7150988 with either good or bad intelligence the most important lesson to learn from this is that we need to rely more on ground troops
7150989 since nato and the coalition dont have these troops the reliance on air support is greater so if they can increase their ground operations it would probably alleviate some of these problems
7150990 this is a civilian house and regretfully when a bombing takes place an aerial bombing or any kind of smart bombing definitely you will have these kind of regretful casualities
7150991 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the unco ordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
7150992 i cannot smile such would be a dire lie and he of creation gazes his fury on it
7150993 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7150994 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7150995 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7150996 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7150997 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7150998 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7150999 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this

7151004 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him

7151006 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7151007 id rather slit a vein than vote for john mccain

7151047 it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness
7151048 hopefully it will help said rafael ramos a son of the woman
7151049 i will go to congress and support legislation that requires electric utilities to produce at least 20 percent of their power from renewable resources by 2020 mandates a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and helps other countries adapt to climate change
7151050 while its obvious that some people have not been doing their jobs we can no longer have a government that puts the profits of oil companies ahead of the needs of the people and we can no longer ignore the realities of climate change we also need to end the skyrocketing gas prices that are hurting our economy and working families
7151051 brandon graduated from borah high school and so hes an idaho boy and im doing this in his memory his names on it and its a legacy were going to build up for him and im sure hed be really happy
7151052 no more killings no more guns no more shooting we love our youth
7151053 the fact that weve had six black youths killed since january tells me that we need to do something different
7151054 theres a short distance between being an attorney and dying a street corner

7151065 teen challenge boasts about its program being saturated with fundamentalist christianity and makes it clear that required participation in religious activities is key to its approach
7151066 bush administration officials have claimed that they do not fund religious activities but this grant suggests otherwise
7151067 apparently their policy is to do it until they get caught
7151068 tax funds were being funneled to this organization even though it openly boasts about its religious content and theres no evidence its approach even works
7151069 this incident is a perfect example of whats so wrong with faith based initiatives
7151070 this was a clear example of unconstitutional support of religious coercion and discrimination im glad we were able to bring the matter to an appropriate conclusion

7151124 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7151125 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7151126 we are very confident but i can not give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7151127 i wish i knew how you could overstate the value of the deadlift
7151128 to say that the would be innovator must be heard gratefully and respectfully is simply to acknowledge the debt we always owe to those who ask unfamiliar questions because they prompt us to explore our tradition more deeply

7151133 people just come to the mall to stay cool said chris balberona a driver for a bank who was at manilas megamall watching ice skaters on an artificial rink
7151134 life is hard right now so we dont really come here to shop
7151135 there has been no noticeable decrease in this number primarily because the malling lifestyle has become a way of life for the filipinos
7151136 if you have small kids of course you go to the mall
7151137 you want your kids to be happy because you hardly see them during the work week
7151138 its like they give you everything just so you go
7151139 before it was a regular family day for us to go to the malls even if we went there to just eat or walk around
7151140 now its really impossible even for that its just out of our budget
7151141 first of all working out a problem provides for necessary friction without which writing is pointless it also makes for a process i go through the sequence of my reactions in chronological order trying not to leave anything out since even the smallest details can contribute i suppose in a sense its like detective work possibly combined with court procedural these things help me to understand the matter at hand if only subjectively but they do not guarantee a resolution which may not be the point anyway i may circle round the matter sift the ashes exhume the cadaver lay everything out on the examination table but that may still leave a core that i cant quite penetrate im relieved when that happens in fact anything i can resolve fully is likely to be insubstantial
7151142 ive seen few films in recent years that have compelled me as much as woody allen opens up for a thoughtful honest conversation

7151149 the teacher who is currently suspended from school and doing clerical work in the selangor education department has been undergoing two week counselling
7151150 she has been reprimanded and given a stern warning the teacher has promised that the incident will not recur
7151151 this is not true it was not a promotion the shift was only a temporary one we view the case very seriously although the parents of the students involved accepted the teachers apology the case had spread widely among the indian community
7151152 a school is a place to instil racial harmony and mutual understanding it shouldnt be used as a zone to quarrel the ministry is constantly monitoring for such situations which will lead to misunderstandings and racial insensitivities
7151153 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7151154 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7151155 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7151156 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7151157 there are some really good candidates running third party campaigns
7151158 if the gop happens to lose because theyve abandoned their principles and traditions maybe that will be a signal for the future
7151159 they have their own sewage system they dont need the government and they dont want its intrusion

7151162 he was a good kid he just needed a little guidance
7151163 he fell behind the wrong crowd and he just did some wrong things but we all make mistakes and he didnt deserve for the chicago police to take his life he didnt deserve it
7151164 we try to make sure everything we do is fair and timely
7151165 i dont need it for what i want to do with computers
7151166 i consider that a mans brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stack it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work
7151167 the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system
7151168 surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning no man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so
7151169 you say that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work
7151170 should priority be given to research driven by the pure curiosity of the specialists or more to the development and practical application of already known scientific results moreover which of the hundreds of specialties from the study of black holes in astrophysics to problems of cognitive psychology in early childhood to vast problems concerning the biomedical research community should be favored

7151228 i just wanted to make sure my son was going to be safe here
7151229 why did you not just ask to see my ship
7151230 linda didnt want me to interrogate you at dinner but i have a few questions about you mari
7151231 a police officer who conducted an illegal search on my property i believe you call it breaking and entering or do you have a warrant
7151232 no not until you tell me why you were about to shoot me
7151233 a defensive habit from being a cop for so long
7151234 have you ever been shot with a disruptor on disable
7151235 how does an eighteen year old own an almost new ford spyder and afford to buy three hundred acres on new korea
7151236 they are flare burns i got them using caledonias sun to slingshot myself to jump
7151237 why do you look so much like princess mia kim
7151238 not unless you charge me with a crime and get a court order
7151239 will you be here when i get home from work tonight
7151240 if i felt my life was in danger from you yes
7151241 now get out and pray i dont tell linda what happened here
7151242 if you harm my family i will kill you myself young lady
7151243 there is a discrepancy in your statement to earth guard bradley and ms lexington and i would like you to explain it to us before you speak with the authorities
7151244 the eight hours worth of time left in your airpaks you were picked up twelve hours after princess mia kims ship allegedly crashed on mc2647
7151245 that may be but it still doesnt explain the events from the time you say she dropped you off until you were picked up by earth guard rescue
7151246 all i know is she said she was leaving the system i made her drop me off and she left me there i found out she was killed after i was rescued
7151247 we came to you because we thought you would talk to us
7151248 if we found this discrepancy dont you think earth guard will dont you think the iss will they will arrest you if they think you are hiding something
7151249 this is still earth and a man is still presumed innocent until he is
7151250 earth guard might play by those rules but the palace wont not if they think you are hiding something
7151251 if the empress feels you contributed to the death of the princess earth law will not protect you
7151252 i will not admit to anything just to ensure a favorable conclusion in the name of diplomacy i told you what i know and that is what i will tell earth guard and the iss
7151253 the report doesnt lie and a human cant regulate breathing enough to conserve that much air do you love her that much that you would sacrifice your freedom to protect her
7151254 you run the risk of causing an incident of galactic proportions if youre not honest with me
7151255 and what does ellingson have to do with this i doubt the world government knows you are cooperating with him
7151256 hes the one who found the discrepancy he invited me along because he thought youd be more cooperative with us than an earth guard interrogator
7151257 if word of this gets out your career would be worthless vanessa
7151258 it was a price i was willing to pay for you to tell me the truth
7151259 from what you and ellingson tell me it looks like i need one
7151260 im going as the guest of captain renkin it is business especially in the wake of princess mia kims death
7151261 what happens if your father or the iss indicts me for contributing to the delinquency of a princess will you jeopardize your career to be with me i think youll cut your losses and hook up with a hero of the empire thats only fitting earths wonder girl and the empires war hero you should ensure peace for another hundred years
7151262 get out vanessa go back to new york and get ready for your jubilee if you want the answers you and ellingson came here for tell your father to indict me and take his chances in court
7151263 you know vanessa she did ask me to go with her she asked and i told her that my place was with you thats the reason i waited on a cold airless asteroid i see that i would have been better off smeared across the surface of that rock
7151264 you are alive and living by the eastern sea princess
7151265 a neutron charge and a mountain is all you needed to fake your death
7151266 you were in sedona this morning and you went with jackson ellingson to see bradley why
7151267 damn it vanessa this is serious arent you wondering how i know
7151268 we have a team on bradley just in case she tries to make contact with him again
7151269 of course travis is not a provocateur and neither is the princess we spotted it as soon as the report was released
7151270 ellingson saw the report yesterday and he called me he asked me to come to sedona to get the truth out of bradley
7151271 thanks its easy when the power settings on the welder are correct
7151272 why dont you run and tell your mother ill be home soon
7151273 and the discrepancies in the story he gave to eg
7151274 from the look in your face id say you know him very well i also know how to use a neutron charge to give the appearance of the destruction of a spacecraft while traveling at one third ls
7151275 dont the police deal in proof or are flights of fancy now considered evidence
7151276 i didnt say i was here to make an arrest princess
7151277 you must have me mistaken with someone else mr chen
7151278 do you think bradley will be able to stand up to the interrogation methods the iss employ you pursuing this anyway
7151279 whats a cop from new seoul doing with his nose in eg business
7151280 because i dont want any trouble and i dont want you putting my son in the same position you put bradley travis
7151281 i told you your family is in no danger from me
7151282 you on the other hand are starting to get on my nerves
7151283 just to be able to live the rest of my life in peace and grow old here
7151284 see john i told you you can do whatever you want
7151285 by the time you go well have you reciting hyperdrive theory in your sleep
7151286 i saw a bunch of soldiers up in the hills
7151287 well i dont know but i saw the reflection of the sun off a few sets of binoculars
7151288 at least i have the confidence to take the test
7151289 youre my friend and being lovers just wouldnt be good
7151290 do you know how many girls have told me that
7151291 i have my own problems that have nothing to do with you
7151292 sorry i just thought that well since we got along so well and have the same interests
7151293 in a few months youre going to be at a school full of girls with the same interests and youll forget all about me
7151294 ill bet none of them are as beautiful as you
7151295 youre sweet but mark my words by midterms youll be calling to tell me you found the love of your life
7151296 sure youre a good looking guy and smart as hell too
7151297 i have to get the field coils aligned if youre not there by nine ill come looking for you
7151298 for what teaching him how to polish plasma conduits and laser weld
7151299 i saw the endorsement on his application and i know it was your doing
7151300 start calling him john johnny is his mothers name for him and shell call him that until the day she dies hes a man now pak and it would do him a lot of good if his father acknowledged it
7151301 do you want to grab something to eat or are you worried your fianc e will find out
7151302 its okay it was bound to happen in the future we just werent meant to be together
7151303 id rather not sit in my room by myself just yet i just cant promise ill be good company
7151304 excellent ill meet you at your room i have to take a shower and change
7151305 she is dead campbell d e a d deader than kelseys nuts gone in a blaze of glory your spirits should get hooked up to the net so they can get timely news
7151306 the balance of power is about to change and we need her to
7151307 our destinies are intertwined mr travis whether you want to admit it or not the galaxy depends on the three of us and we cannot abdicate our responsibility
7151308 after the terrible weekend allan mcnish and i had at the n rburgring it is so nice to be back in a top position for me this pole is really special because i could not run in the session before qualifying i was a little bit afraid but on my first flying lap i understood that the car was good and a like it i had just to push i had a big power slide out of the last corner and i was afraid that this could have cost me the pole but at the end it was good enough
7151309 we could not hope for more we have both cars in front both dindo capello and marco werner did a really extraordinary job to put both audis on the front row on this track which is normally not the best for us is really exceptional we are very happy with the set up for the race we start from the best position lets just hope it will not rain tomorrow
7151310 i am actually quite satisfied marco werner is of course a bit disappointed because definitely more would have been possible weve all seen that but thats racing sometimes you are lucky sometimes unlucky our day was tough but good after what happened yesterday we can be happy with second position on the grid we have a good car for the race im looking forward for tomorrow
7151311 of course we are satisfied to have both cars on the front row personally ive a fairly thick neck because of mister montagny who cost me two tenths of a second this would have been pole but the most important thing is we have both audis in front
7151312 it was a great team effort especially after what happened yesterday both cars were back in good shape for qualifying and both drivers did a fantastic job congratulations to the drivers and the whole team for their hard work
7151313 a large part of the improvement in our time is due to the new dfi engine with direct fuel injection but compared to 2007 weve also improved the cars set up considerably although i was almost three tenths of a second faster than the top acura itll still be close racing tomorrow
7151314 towards the end of the qualifying we made some more changes to the car and they paid off
7151315 im sure we can make the car a touch faster for the race
7151316 im very pleased with position two on the grid not a lot more was possible today
7151317 this circuit is extremely difficult for drivers so im expecting a very exciting race tomorrow romains qualifying lap was a huge achievement
7151318 the competition in the gt2 could hardly be closer either the outcome of the race is anyones guess
7151319 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7151320 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
7151321 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7151322 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7151323 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped

7151329 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7151330 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7151331 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7151332 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7151333 the exploratorium snackbook http www kendallhunt com elhi cssea html 7 atau string and stiky tape experiments and turning the word inside out an 174 other simple physics demontrations physics
7151334 finally while senator schumers statements may have accelerated public concern about indymacs financial condition we do not believe that we can prove that they caused the banks failure
7151335 concern for the safety and soundness risks posed by indymac
7151336 while we certainly empathize with the plight of the employees their ire is better directed at the management of indymac
7151337 getting agitated doesnt help i dont think ill do that anymore
7151338 i would like to impress upon this committee that 144 a barrel oil will be perceived as a victory for the jihadist movement and a reaffirmation that the economic warfare component of its campaign against the west is a resounding success
7151339 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7151340 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7151341 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7151342 we need to win the war before we withdraw our troops
7151343 exactly what proof do you have that man is responsible for global warming
7151344 well thats the sixty four thousand dollar question we dont know the answer to that and its for that reason that i just got a grant from the national cancer institute nci to try and understand the answer to that
7151345 so theres the great flavor the great taste the ease of smoking and then theres a social factor
7151346 vibrai rijo o chicote marinheiros fazei os mais dan ar
7151347 why would we feel that that is in the past its over also its not the fault of americans who come here now why would we take it out on them
7151348 im particularly angry because some of those khmer rouge people are in power now theyre not khmer rouge any more but they havent been punished or anything i think they should go to gaol

7151363 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colors but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7151364 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7151365 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7151366 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7151367 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7151368 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7151369 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7151370 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

7151407 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it

7151410 ronit peled from the faculty of health sciences at ben gurion university of the negev israel led a team of researchers who questioned 255 women with breast cancer and 367 healthy controls about their life experiences and evaluated their levels of happiness optimism anxiety and depression prior to diagnosis
7151411 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7151412 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7151413 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7151414 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7151443 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7151444 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7151445 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7151446 well be angry well be against it but we wont shoot at the hebron
7151447 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7151448 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a so we have good support
7151449 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarization open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7151450 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay

7151453 carrie kicked the door open for taylor to pass through
7151454 but we have an investment in blood and blood dear beloved is a big expense and should be respected and cherished
7151455 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the international space station for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7151456 the us government cannot pay russia for services to the space station unless the president can certify that russia is no longer supporting iran and these other countries
7151457 well we know that he cant do that the only way around that is to have a waiver that waiver that has been in effect expires in 2011 that has not been resolved yet so that we can have the ability to buy flights for us astronauts on russian spacecraft
7151458 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
7151459 it is a lose lose situation we have a 100 billion space station and in theory we couldnt even get people up there

7151470 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7151471 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7151472 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7151473 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7151474 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7151475 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7151476 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7151477 based upon my review and the need for public confidence in i have concluded that an outside opinion is warranted

7151479 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job

7151496 nato itself would have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that give it meaning
7151497 the norms of law cannot be interpreted narrowly formally in isolation from the general context of the modern world
7151498 by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting pre emptively
7151499 to keep military strength beyond challenge thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace
7151500 any comprehensive u s threat assessment would conclude that the normal constraints of international politics counterbalancing powers no longer immediately inhibit the exercise of american might
7151501 history has called america and our allies to action and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedoms fight

7151528 obama from the crowd in springfield illinois and a rueful smile from the vp hopeful
7151529 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you one of the aides said
7151530 obama biden banners made their debut in springfield as the 35 000 strong crowd gave a rapturous welcome to the two democrats standing on the same steps where senator obama launched his white house quest back in february 2007

7151532 do you want time off or a holiday on august 26 polling day probably a day off i will relay the message to penang chief minister lim guan eng

7151537 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7151538 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7151539 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7151540 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7151541 i felt confident when he fought back after mambo in seattle got to him but the wire looked like it was never going to come up

7151543 im 46 but people were making me feel like im 80
7151544 i always said that if you win it once its great but if you win it twice it really validates your ability
7151545 i thought i just turned 46 and all of a sudden ive got a bad back
7151546 i had been getting to the age when i was thinking you dont know if youre going to win another one

7151574 today has been a truly remarkable and memorable day it was wonderful to spend time getting to know gloria for she is a very smart inspiring and hopeful woman i can honestly say that she gave one of the best speeches i have heard while at hamilton

7151598 chet had the right background hes a southern moderate with strength in veterans issues but hes not as well known as these other individuals
7151599 and its very unusual for someone in the house to make it on the ticket
7151600 chet has really benefited by this process and now more people know who he is and think positively of him
7151601 my priorities have been my family and to fight for our district and be a champion for veterans and military families
7151602 to accomplish those goals did not require me to cater to the washington press corps or to run around in the d c social circles as a consequence i am not known nationally but that doesnt bother me i just try to be a workhorse and not a show horse

7151898 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7151899 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defence foreign affairs and oil revenues
7151900 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7151901 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7151902 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilisation against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centrepiece of their iraq strategy
7151903 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7151904 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7151905 oh this is by no means what a hollywood party is like
7151906 those dont look like woolly mammoths theyre like cartoon fiberglass elephants fooking ell
7151907 none of them know what those strange oblong things called books are
7151908 they probably call it the wall with good childrens names
7151909 is this what its like when you go out in hollywood
7151910 this is how the other half live im an east side hipster we stick to indie rock red wine and artistic integrity
7151911 i dunno maybe theyre hefs playmates or maybe theyre on some reality show
7151912 what show would that be surgical mistakes stephen quipped no doubt coming soon on spike tv
7151913 im singularly responsible for harvey dent and the arc of that character and then everything else in between we would just collaborate on to various degrees
7151914 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7151915 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7151919 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7151920 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

7151934 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7151935 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7151936 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7151937 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7151938 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7151939 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7151940 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7151941 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7151942 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7151943 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7151944 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7151947 everyone is talking about how it will really serve the interests of the americans not the iraqis
7151948 everyone knows the u s administration once they occupy a country if they want to make an agreement to stay 80 of the terms will fulfill their interests
7151949 we want to rebuild our army police society we want to help our country
7151950 they came to us as liberators and now they are occupiers this is ridiculous its been five years
7151951 the government that came with this occupation does not represent us
7151952 we dont want any financial agreement any political agreement any security agreement with them we dont want anything to do with them
7151953 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7151954 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7151955 the ones in baghdad and diyala province just changed their t shirts there are large numbers who were really al qaeda we have to really look hard for those elements without blood on their hands
7151956 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7151957 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7151958 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7151959 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
7151960 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7151961 we have the same problems around the country we cant just create a program to pay some people and not others
7151962 if the government of iraq doesnt decide to employ all of them you have jobless rates that skyrocket
7151963 we dont have a get out of jail free card for the sons of iraq there is law and order in this country and we respect the iraqi government
7151964 in the event that the u s military and government dont live up to their promises it could turn back to a violent form of resistance
7151965 we have to get rid of the iranian influence in iraq and rebuild the democratic state
7151966 definitely he will go to the resistance he will go back to violence
7151967 we feel this is a political game to embarrass and expel us
7151968 we are just dealing with the matter because we have no choice
7151969 to the point where every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to
7151970 i can use him as a hitter but we need to let that quiet down so with a day off i chose this time
7151971 were not going to sit idly by there will be changes
7151972 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7151973 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7151974 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7151975 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7151976 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7151977 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7151978 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7151979 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7151980 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7151981 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7151982 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7151983 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7151984 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7151985 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7151986 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7151987 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7151988 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7151989 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7151990 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7151991 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7151992 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7151993 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7151994 will win the al wild card and make things interesting
7151995 since tampas success is a hot topic lately i thought it would be a good time to revisit this post the insane reasons for my prediction and see if i can find any statistical links showing why the
7151996 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
7151997 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
7151998 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
7151999 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7152000 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7152001 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7152002 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7152003 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7152004 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7152005 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7152006 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7152007 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7152008 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7152009 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7152010 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7152011 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7152012 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7152013 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7152014 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7152015 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7152016 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7152017 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7152018 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7152019 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7152020 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7152021 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7152022 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7152023 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7152024 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7152025 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7152026 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7152027 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7152028 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7152029 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7152030 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7152031 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7152032 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7152033 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7152034 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7152035 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7152036 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7152037 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7152038 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7152039 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7152040 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7152041 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7152042 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7152043 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7152044 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7152045 im more enlightened then thou since i use a mac
7152046 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7152047 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7152048 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7152049 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7152050 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7152051 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7152052 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7152053 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7152054 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7152055 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7152056 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7152057 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7152058 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7152059 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7152060 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7152061 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7152062 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7152063 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7152064 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7152065 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7152066 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7152067 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7152068 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7152069 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7152070 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7152071 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7152072 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7152073 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7152074 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7152075 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7152076 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7152077 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7152078 pour le second ton mod nest simplement pas francis ou pas de support de la langue fran aise donnes nous le nom de ce mod si cest bien celui auquel je pense
7152079 the branch of medicine that deals with the care of women during pregnancy and childbirth and for some six weeks following delivery
7152080 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7152081 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7152082 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7152083 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7152084 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7152085 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7152086 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7152087 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7152088 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7152089 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7152090 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7152091 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7152092 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7152093 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7152094 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7152095 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7152096 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7152097 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7152098 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7152099 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7152100 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7152101 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7152102 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7152103 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7152104 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7152105 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7152106 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7152107 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7152108 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7152109 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7152110 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7152111 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7152112 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7152113 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7152114 try and have a normal life and not let work dominate me
7152115 i had a day job as an office manager for the seattle office of an international firm
7152116 what did i do why did i order a fireman that makes no sense im going to look like an idiot
7152117 am i the only one who sees a giant wang
7152118 wait a minute this is not an erotic bakery this is costco i should be able to order any stupid cake i want and be confident that it will not be sexually charged

7152121 i am not finished and it is rude to interrupt do not tell me that you have add and will forget what you meant to say and therefore must interrupt because i have add now too or did you forget
7152122 no i did not say that i could predict the future or know more than the doctors do but
7152123 god dang it what do you think they are going to do to fix the kid you cannot fix a genetic condition you just cant
7152124 a little cystic fibrosis and those kids can digest food just fine with enzymes
7152125 but i need to get some things from there before i leeeeave
7152126 organizarea acestui congres deriv din situa ia intern din partid incluz nd rezultatele foarte slabe ob inute la alegerile locale precum i necesitatea preg tirii unei conduite politice a partidului n alegeri n data de 5 iulie am avut o edin a cnc la bucure ti iar atunci am discutat despre aceste aspecte de i conducerea partidului i m refer aici la domnii milu i pavelescu a evitat acest lucru eu am cerut atunci ca pre edinte al cnc s fie ridicate sanc iunile care s au dat i s nu se mai ia astfel de m suri dar s a refuzat totodat am cerut i convocarea congresului
7152127 n data de 23 iulie am avut la timi oara o discu ie cu domnul milu
7152128 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the groundballs that i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day basically everything you dont want to do i did today
7152129 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone
7152130 he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7152131 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7152132 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7152133 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7152134 a lot of the time especially at this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7152135 its kind of cool that it was here in toronto where i started where i had number one
7152136 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7152137 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7152138 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7152139 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7152140 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7152141 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
7152142 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7152143 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7152144 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
7152145 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
7152146 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
7152147 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
7152148 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
7152149 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
7152150 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
7152151 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things
7152152 if the perception prevails out there then people are going to miss an opportunity to get a good value
7152153 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university
7152154 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university
7152155 few will have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation
7152156 i hide my thefts and disguise them these other authors put them on parade and on account thus they have better credit with the law than i like those who steal horses i paint them mane and tail and sometimes poke out an eye if their first master used them as amblers i put them to trot and to the pack saddle if they served for the riding saddle
7152157 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7152158 do you think the plagarism thing will hurt biden and obama in the election many people think its old news but it was the first thing i thought of when bidens name came up as a potential running mate
7152159 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7152160 im going to make this country proud of our government again
7152161 my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
7152162 the kids are in the streets theyve got their t shirts on theyre eating salsa and chips and shouting viva chuck todd

7152174 please can we start we have our nap planned for 2 pm
7152175 i need you to contact the american embassy in st petersburg to confirm that it is safe for americans to visit under the current climate
7152176 i called before we left but i need an update on the situation before myself and my wife go ashore and i am surprised you have not told the passengers this as well
7152177 well i just saw the news and it doesnt look good the russian troops have taken georgia and have just crossed the border into alabama and cnn reports large explosions coming from inside a taco bell what you just experienced there is two and half lines of nothing which was freds exact response
7152178 i want to come to britain so i can buy an arabic newspaper from an indian store where the cashier speaks polish
7152179 a native of scranton pa bidens heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class in the senate biden has fought for americas cops firefighters and other first responders
7152180 the obama biden partnership is uniquely suited to bring about the change america needs put our country back on track
7152181 setelah mendengarkan penjelasan dari perwakilan kedua belah pihak serta kedua pembalap steward memutuskan tidak perlu ada tindakan terhadap insiden tersebut
7152182 saya tidak bisa mempercayainya saya tertahan oleh timo dan tentu saja saya teringat budapest hungaria karena itu insiden yang persis sama
7152183 we only want to use chemotherapy where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help use determine that
7152184 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer
7152185 the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatment this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
7152186 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
7152187 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
7152188 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
7152189 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralises their potential benefits
7152190 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolising enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
7152191 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7152192 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7152193 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7152194 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped
7152195 we are now collecting the corpses lying in the streets
7152196 the town is calm today and were busy burying the victims of the fighting the islamists are at the abandoned sea and air ports and people here are hoping to reopen their businesses
7152197 its the second most traumatic thing thats happened in my life
7152198 i woke up somewhere in the middle of my surgery
7152199 i felt tug tug tug pull it felt like someone was reaching into my belly button and pulling my organs out i wanted to give some kind of sign but i couldnt
7152200 i was screaming shaking and going into the fetal position the pain was on a level that is completely indescribable and my body was going into the comfort position because it couldnt take it
7152201 im having night terrors and hyperventilating my blood pressure and heart rate shoot up im a wreck im a total wreck
7152202 the psychiatric care should be within hours hours make a difference
7152203 i would make contact with a counselor or psychiatrist right away
7152204 it would be up to that professional to make a determination on the timetable
7152205 barb go to sleep go to sleep they dont know youre here
7152206 heart rate and blood pressure which are monitored during surgery are not always indicators of alertness
7152207 if nothing else id like to see these monitors used to prevent this from ever happening to anybody else
7152208 theres no way im ever going to have surgery ever again ever
7152209 you expect to wake up and get on with healing you dont expect to fall apart its a horrific horrific ordeal its too horrible to explain
7152210 almost a week after the surgery she talked about it and broke down and bawled her eyes out for five minutes solid
7152211 shes literally obsessed with this now it is consuming her she has the nightmares on a nightly basis
7152212 most people just have a vague recollection of being in the operating room
7152213 we need to alert the public not to scare them but to spare them
7152214 my surgeon was awesome and id recommend him to anyone
7152215 but i dont know that ill ever get over the surgery how could i
7152216 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7152217 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7152218 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7152219 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7152220 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7152221 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7152222 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7152223 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7152224 the hum an papilloma virus vacc ination programme will offer the hpv vaccine to girls and young women aged 12 to 18 years of age
7152225 we are currently considering the issues around offering the vaccine to those over 18 years of age including the cost effectiveness of such an intervention
7152226 vaccinating older girls and women who have active sexual lives will have an effect but it will be much less than immunising the virgins
7152227 there is the real anxiety that these older girls and women may think that they have had a magic bullet are protected dont go for their smears and the cancers arent picked up at an early stage
7152228 this seems a logical approach to the issue and it is in line with the approach other countries have taken
7152229 you have probably noticed i am not short of confidence
7152230 its the snp that have a 10 000 majority not us
7152231 the problem for us is becoming too self critical defensive or defeatist we should have more pride in ourselves
7152232 winning for a purpose what is a fourth term for
7152233 my centre is giving way my right is in retreat situation excellent i shall attack
7152234 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
7152235 but it not just taking the lift to the office and leading a highly sedentary lifestyle that will increase the risk factor
7152236 too often patients attribute heart attack symptoms to indigestion fatigue or stress and consequently delay seeking prompt medical attention
7152237 early diagnosis and treatment saves lives and delays in getting medical assistance can be fatal
7152238 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
7152239 huh bub i can see why they have just kept their mouth shut on anything brought up in these forums
7152240 its just weird i mean something happened to make this guy veer left off the runway
7152241 the fire was so intense theres not a lot of the plane left
7152242 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7152243 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7152244 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7152245 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7152246 recognize ccp as an emerging anglican province in north america
7152247 recognize ccp as the emerging anglican province in north america
7152248 our prayer is that our common cause federation will continue to grow and mature as anglican province
7152249 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7152250 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7152251 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7152252 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7152253 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
7152254 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7152255 thank you so much for saying that that is the nicest thing anyone has said to me all day
7152256 those folks specialized in primaries and now were focusing on the general
7152257 the poll was flawed because normal people dont use landlines
7152258 who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain
7152259 if you are praying for your house to be paid off sew a seed and make a house payment for someone else who needs it
7152260 he must be fleecing his flock i mean did you get a whiff of him all those expensive spices and oils
7152261 where did he get the moeny to pay for all that bread and fish
7152262 he rode into town while others walked who does he think he is
7152263 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
7152264 whats the best way to protect yourself from a knife
7152265 wrought under the sea beyond the memory of any person now living
7152266 the fashion world is getting bigger everyone is interested in brazil and russia and india the new markets are very open to innovative ideas which makes them exciting
7152267 im a brazilian person but i dont consider myself to be a brazilian designer
7152268 i try to study all different cultures and cater for different tastes however i cant think about winter summer is my focus and my designs are brightly coloured brazil is all about bright colours
7152269 this paper argues that recent and future changes in the employment of crown servant engineers will soon leave the mod unable to fulfil its intelligent customer remit and hence jeopardize airworthiness
7152270 engineering teams are punch drunk with additional requirements and there is evidence that they do not have the capacity to comply with existing regulations
7152271 no oh well i suppose i sort of have mmm yes
7152272 a very small politician in stature of place in the world and position
7152273 i cant tell you anymore about it but it was a long long time ago
7152274 like a size 10 foot in a size six shoe
7152275 its very demeaning to be standing here but at the moment we dont have any other way to get food
7152276 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7152277 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7152278 i think there is more emphasis on our creativity of the sporting legacy that is left after the olympics and on fun in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world i think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012
7152279 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7152280 we are looking at what we can do with the various sites and venues to make sure that we dont have a significant waste of taxpayers money
7152281 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7152282 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7152283 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7152284 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgement who doesnt have to hide behind bluster
7152285 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7152286 he has disdain for privilege and for limousine liberals the mark of an honest working class democrat
7152287 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7152288 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through dangerous waters internationally
7152289 i got elected when i was 29 and i got elected november the 7th and on december 18th of that year my wife and three kids were christmas shopping for a christmas tree a tractor trailer a guy who allegedly and i never pursued it drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalised my two sons with what were thought to be at the time permanent fundamental injuries
7152290 the forced production of cotton and rice originally not indigenous to hungary
7152291 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus
7152292 we are for responsible adult behaviour when it comes to alcohol
7152293 take care of each other and use our alcohol treatment services to the maximum
7152294 oh man we have alcohol we better drink it all tonight because we might not have any next weekend
7152295 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7152296 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7152297 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7152298 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7152299 based upon my review and the need for public confidence in new orleans flood protection system i have concluded that an outside opinion is warranted
7152300 we will work closely with these independent reviewers to ensure that all issues are dealt with comprehensively and expeditiously and we are quite confident that when all is said and done the end result will be the same as the previous investigations and audits
7152301 implies that operator error was responsible for the mammoth hydraulic pump failures
7152302 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and catastrophic failures of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job
7152303 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7152304 it was a result of our continuing investigation into the trace back of contaminated meats
7152305 because it was such a small quantity we were able to identify the specific stores
7152306 we are always looking for ways to reduce our carbon footprint
7152307 it is great to see the shires out again on the roads around town
7152308 we are aiming to get them out delivering within a mile or twos radius of the stables when we can fit it in to their busy schedule
7152309 deliveries by horse drawn dray finished about five years ago when we moved distribution off site
7152310 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

7152331 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
7152332 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
7152333 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results

7152362 already as a youth i wanted to be a rastafarian since then no hairdresser was allowed to touch my scalp of course
7152363 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near
7152364 if my people pray then will i hear from heaven
7152365 god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you
7152366 evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud
7152367 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit
7152368 i exhort therefore that prayers be made for all men
7152369 and shall not doubt in his heart and when ye pray believe
7152370 o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come
7152371 enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise
7152372 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually
7152373 wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel
7152374 in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god
7152375 ask and it shall be given you for everyone that asketh receiveth
7152376 if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them
7152377 and in all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
7152378 how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him
7152379 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it
7152380 ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you
7152381 hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full
7152382 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god but let him ask in faith nothing wavering
7152383 yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss
7152384 if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us
7152385 ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts
7152386 whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
7152387 if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me
7152388 when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood
7152389 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us
7152390 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight
7152391 oh thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come
7152392 and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear
7152393 call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not
7152394 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven
7152395 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers
7152396 what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
7152397 if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
7152398 if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it
7152399 and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
7152400 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
7152401 did not have professional trained staff dedicated to the function of getting requirements and the vast majority view the process of getting requirements to be inefficient
7152402 we just realized that were building products for customers not just for technologys sake so the sooner we could engage with our customers the better we could make it from an architecture feature quality and scalability perspective all of the things that customers care about
7152403 users get earlier glimpses of products and microsoft gets feedback earlier but the jury is still out on whether microsoft is going to ship software more quickly and reliably as a result
7152404 i believe microsoft attempts to do agile programming where possible but the reality of its situation is that the complexity and size of the code base prevents it from truly implementing that coding process
7152405 now its a matter of making itself semiagile wherever possible
7152406 but we are driven by the end quality we feel we have to deliver which lives on far after the rtm party we have on campus
7152407 almost everything that we asked for while testing sql server 2008 is now in the final product
7152408 we had a lot more time to evaluate the product
7152409 and we were more experienced about how to work directly with the people at microsoft
7152410 truly are listening and really take into account what is said
7152411 they dont take on a hubris in the product development that they know best
7152412 a lot of discussion about whether microsoft is actually pushing out ctps too quickly
7152413 our philosophy for the most part was i know what im building is right for you
7152414 and the feedback that we wanted was here are some bugs
7152415 that way a group can really own a particular feature
7152416 i think its a much bigger thing for a tester to roll out a piece of infrastructure like windows server
7152417 so we release both ctps and betas but we offer better support for betas to encourage testers to actually go into production with them
7152418 even though we deployed the windows server 2008 beta in our production environment it takes time to go through our change management testing and validation process
7152419 leader who is ready to step in and be president

7152458 yang datang mungkin sekali manusia manusia jahat semua orang pandai di kong beng leng terluka berat selama tujuh delapan hari mereka belum mendapat pengobatan yang tepat kita tak akan bisa melawan musuh kalau bertempur kita semua akan mengantarkan jiwa
7152459 musuh meyerang dari tiga jurusan saudara saudara kita tak tahan
7152460 thio tayhiap yo co soe wie hiat ong musuh yang menyerang kita terdiri dari kie keng pang hay see pay sin koen boen dan lain lain

7152463 kay pang bersama sam boen pang dan boe san pang juga turut menyerang
7152464 bangsat segala partai cilik seperti ngo beng to dan toan hoen chio juga berani datang kemari aku mau lihat apa yang bisa diperbuat mereka
7152465 jalan satu satunya menyembunyikan diri dalam jalanan rahasia musuh mungkin tak akan tahu tapi seandainya mereka tahu tak gampang gampang mereka menerjang masuk
7152466 kau sekarang mundur untuk sementara waktu begitu lekas kita sudah sembuh kita boleh keluar untuk bertarung menurut pendapatku tindakan ini sama sekali tidak menurunkan derajat atau keangkeran kita
7152467 para cianpwee walaupun thio boe kie bukan anggauta beng kauw tapi sesudah kita bersama sama melewati bahaya besar perhubungan antara kita adalah perhubungan mati hidup bersama sama apakah para cianpwee kira aku seorang manusia yang takut mati apakah para cianpwee duga ada sesuatu yang tidak diketahui olehku
7152468 menurut peraturan beng kauw yang sudah berturun turun jalanan rahasia di kong beng teng dianggap sebagai tempat suci kecuali kauw coe anggota yang manapun jua tak boleh masuk kesitu siapa yang melanggar peraturan dia akan kena hukuman mati karena thio tayhiap dan siauw ciauw bukan anggotra partai maka kalian berdua tak usah menaati peraturan tersebut
7152469 thio tayhiap memiliki ilmu silat yang sangat tinggi dan rasa perikemanusiaan yang sangat luhur di samping itu thio tayhiap telah membuang budi yang besar luar biasa kepada kita sampai mati kita semua tak akan bisa membalas budi itu kalau sekarang kita ramai ramai mengangkat kau sebagai kauw coe turunan ke tiga puluh empat maka sebagai kauw coe kau bisa memerintah kita semua untuk masuk ke jalan jalan rahasia itu kalau di perintah oleh kauw coe sendiri kita tidak melanggar peraturan yang sudah ditetapkan
7152470 boanpwee masih terlalu muda dan berpengetahuan terlampau cetek boanpwee tidak mempunyai kemuliaan apapun jua bagaimana boanpwee bisa menerima tanggung jawab yang sedemikian berat disamping itu thay soehoe juga pernah memesan bahwa boanpwee sekali kali tidak boleh masuk ke dalam kalangan beng kauw dengan merasa sangat menyesal boanpwee tidak bisa menerima usul pheng tay soe
7152471 boe kie aku adalah kakekmu dan sebagai kakek aku sekarang memerintahkan supaya kau masuk ke dalam beng kauw
7152472 andai kata dalam ikatan dengan kau kedudukan sebagai kakek tidak lebih tinggi dari thay soehoemu tapi sedikitnya sebagai kakek aku tidak jauh lebih rendah dari guru besar itu sekarang dengan menggunakan kekuasaan sebagai kakek aku memudahkan perintah thay soehoemu kalau kau menerima orang luar pasti tak akan bisa menyalahkan kau tapi biar bagaimanapun jua aku menyerahkan segala keputusan kepada pertimbanganmu sendiri
7152473 kata orang bertemu dengan paman seperti bertemu dengan orang tua sendiri orang tuamu sudah meninggal dunia dan aku sebagai pamanmu bisa menggantikan kedudukan orangtuamu
7152474 waktu berada dalam jalan rahasia aku telah mendapatkan surat wasiat mendiang yo kauw coe aku mengambil surat itu untuk diperingatkan kepada kalian dan surat tersebut mendiang yo kauw coe memesan supaya ayah angkatku kamo mo say ong diangkat menjadi kauw coe untuk sementara waktu
7152475 seorang laki laki tidak boleh terlaku berkukuh dalam hal hal kecil seorang laki laki haris bisa menyesuaikan diri dengan perubahan perubahan besar dalam dunia sekarang cia soen tidak berada di sini maka itu aku sekarang mengusulkan supaya sesuai dengan keinginan mendiang yo kauw coe thio tayhiap menduduki kursi kauw coe untuk sementara waktu
7152476 sesudah para cianpwee mengunjuk kecintaan yang sedemikian besar jika aku tetap menolak maka aku akan menjadi manusia yang berdosa sekarang untuk sementara waktu boe kie menerima kedudukan kauw coe nanti sesudah kita melewati bahaya dengan selamatan kuharap kalian suka mengangkat seorang lain yang lebih cakap
7152477 aduh harap kalian jangan begitu bangunlah yo co soe aku minta kau segera menyampaikan perintah kepada semua orang supaya seluruh anggota agama kita dari yang tinggi sampai yang rendah semua masuk ke jalanan rahasia perintahkan ang so kie dan liat hwee kie melepas api dan menahan musuh semua bangunan yang berdiri di atas kong beng teng harus dibakar habis

7152479 biarpun seng koen adik seperguruan mendiang yo kauw coe dan guru dari kim mo say ong kita tak pernah bertemu muka dengannya
7152480 siapapun takkan menduga bahwa selama beberapa puluh tahun ia mengatur dan menjalankan siasat untuk merobohkan beng kauw
7152481 yo coe soe wie hong ong sesudah masuk dalam perangkap kalian masih juga belum mendusin dan dilihat begini kalian seperti juga manusia manusia tolol
7152482 pada akhirnya bangsat seng koen mampus juga dalam tangan saudara ya ong
7152483 kalian baru saja sembuh dan tenaga dalam belum pulih semuanya bersabarlah beberapa hari lagi
7152484 yo co soe selama beberapa hari ini nona kecil itu tidak pernah melakukan pelanggaran apa apa kuharap kau suka membuka rantainya
7152485 kauw coe biarpun siauw ciauw masih berusia muda tindakan tindakannya sangat aneh kita harus berhati hati
7152486 pada waktu kira kira setengah tahun yang lalu waktu aku bersama poet hwie jalan jalan di bawah gunung tiba tiba kulihat dia sedang menangis di gurun pasir sambil memeluk dua mayat
7152487 sesudah siauw ciauw berdiam di kong beng teng pada suatu hari ketika aku mengajar ilmu silat kepada poet hwie itu terjadi sesuatu yang luar biasa aku mencoba memberi penjelasan tentang kedudukan ke enam puluh empat dari pat kwa anehnya poet hwie masih belum mengerti mata siauw ciauw sudah mengawasi kedudukan yang benar
7152488 tapi belakangan aku bercuriga dan dengan sengaja menyebutkan satu kauw koat teori ilmu silat yang sangat sulit kauw koat itu belum pernah diturunkan kepada poet hwie untuk menjajalnya aku sengaja menyebutkan kedudukan kedudukan pat kwa yang kalah benar saja kulihat alisnya berkerut sehingga aku menarik kesimpulan bahwa ia tahu akan kesalahanku itu mulai waktu itu aku berhati hati aku tahu bahwa nona cilik ini memiliki kepandaian tinggi dan kedatangannya ke kong beng teng mengandung maksud tertentu
7152489 apakah tidak bisa jadi kedua orang tuanya paham kitab ya keng dan ia mendapat pelajaran turunan
7152490 sebagiamana kauw coe tahu ya keng yang dipelajari oleh seorang selalu bersamaa dengan ya keng yang dipelajari untuk ilmu silat kalau benar siauw ciauw mendapat pelajaran itu dari kedua orang tuanya maka kedua orang itu adalah ahli ahli silat kelas utama supaya dia tidak bercuriga sikapku sama sekali tidak berubah beberapa hari kemudian dengan menggunakan satu kesempatan baik aku menanyakan nama ayah ibunya dan asal usul mereka tapi ia sangat licin dan aku tidak dapat meraba apapun jua akupun tidak marah aku hanya memesan supaya poet hwie berhati hati satu hari aku berguyon dan poet hwie tertawa terbahak bahak siauw ciauw yang juga berada di situ tak takut untuk tidak tertawa ia berdiri di belakang aku dan poet hwie dan rupanya ia mangganggap kami berdua tidak akan lihat tertawanya di luar dugaannya ketika itu poet hwie sedang memegang sebatang cit sioe pisau yang mengkilap bagaikan kaca dan bayangan mukanya terlihat nyata ke badan pisau itu dengan tertawanya itu penyamarannya terlucuti ia ternyata bukan seorang wanita jelek romannya yang jelek bukan sewajarnya tapi dibuat buat kecantikannya bahkan melebih poet hwie
7152491 membuat muka yang aneh itu terus menerus memang bukan pekerjaan mudah
7152492 malam itu sesudah larut malam diam diam aku pergi ke kamar poet hwie untuk mengintip gerak geriknya
7152493 bahwa ia masuk keluar kamar hanya untuk main main karena tak bisa pulas
7152494 kauw coe aku merasa pasti bahwa dia datang kemari atas suruhan musuh kita sebab dia mengerti kedudukan kedudukan pat kwa maka mungkin sekali dia anggauta boe tong ataupun go bie tapi biar bagaimanapun jua kita tentu tak usah terlalu berkuatir dia hanya seorang gadis cilik dengan mengingat jasanya bahwa dia sudah merawat kauw coe selama beberapa hari kauw coe sudah menaruh belas kasihan dan mengampuninya dia untung besar bertemu dengan kauw coe dan aku pun tidak menentang keputusan kauw coe
7152495 yo co soe sudah lama kita terkurung di penjara dan kurasa sekarang sudah tiba waktunya untuk kita mencari sedikit hiburan
7152496 kedua ciang kie soe dari ang soen dan kie bok tak boleh ikut serta yang lain keluar semua
7152497 musuh sudah menyerang sampai di sini biarpun kita tak ingin bertempur kita tak bisa tidak bertempur akan tetapi kalau bukan terlalu terpaksa kita tak boleh melukai atau membunuh sesama manusia kuharap kalian suka ingat pesan ini
7152498 saudara saudara peh bie kauw yang di pimpin oleh in kauw coe harus menyerang dari jurusan barat ngo heng kie yang di pimpin oleh boen ciong siong ciang kie soe dari kei bok kie menyerang dari timur yo co soe yang memimpin soe boen menyerang dari utara ngo siang jin menyerang dari selatan wie hong ong dan aku sendiri akan berdiam di tengah tengah untuk memberi bantuan kepada yang memerlukan bantuan
7152499 kita berdua keluar dari jalanan rahasia dan serang mereka secara mendadak
7152500 anggota anggota dari berbagai partai dengarlah semua pemimpin beng kauw sekarang berkumpul di sini tak guna kalian melawan terus lemparkan senjata kalian aku akan mengampuni jiwa kalian dan memperbolehkan turun gunung tanpa diganggu
7152501 mengapa pedang milik go bie itu bisa di tangan tay soe
7152502 nah why bother now i wore it like this all day
7152503 for me this is a tremendous accomplishment this guys work ethic has been off the charts i want to see him in the clubhouse and i want him to be part of the club theres a place on this team for him next year hell be pitching in some role at the end of games next year
7152504 right now im just getting myself ready to play at the big league level whether it be the sixth seventh eighth ninth inning it doesnt really matter at this point
7152505 obviously anytime velocity is down its a concern especially when youre used to looking at a power pitcher
7152506 daniel is a power guy when you start to see that you start to say is he ok but he said that he feels good he feels strong
7152507 anything is possible and believe me weve talked about a lot of those things
7152508 obviously a guy that is throwing the ball with conviction and feels confident in what theyre doing they get more out of what theyre doing
7152509 i think it would suit him better to know when hes going to pitch to get him more on a routine of what he does in between starts
7152510 well playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7152511 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7152512 everything i hit everything i putt just falls into the hole and its just amazing
7152513 i was playing well coming in but still you dont know exactly how you are going to show up for an event
7152514 but now that ive been hitting it well for a while i can be a little bit at ease because you get some confidence going
7152515 uh you arent by chance moving the girlies bed upstairs now are you
7152516 weve got people coming for dinner in an hour and a half and youre bringing up the bed now unbelievable do not move it up g will want people to come to her room to play and i guarantee you wont have the frame up in time it will be sitting there for kids to run into and crack their knees open with the metal corners not a good idea
7152517 all right take it easy poor judgement perhaps but dont get so mad at me its totally uncalled for
7152518 oh yes it does youre getting better but i swear since weve been married every time we entertain you run out at the last minute to get booze and im by myself to get the door drinks and continue to prepare the apps and food
7152519 yeah i guess so tight that it was completely off
7152520 this minds a solitary confinement everywhere i run a wall appears the shadows grow bigger the light keeps fading away soon there will only be darkness frightning sounds screams and laughter the breathe of the demons chase chills along the skin a thousand deaths in slow motion a million lies become the truth in time the dark becomes comforting the screams are soothing the demons are my only friends a real death is the my only fantasy the walls keep me safe happiness found in the lies never to realise the truth i only lied to myself it was never murder only suicide i am the many demons i was the only one screaming i couldnt see cuz i looked away and the only wall blocking my path was the failure to believe in myself but im happy here in my mind becuz no one can hurt me anymore no one but me
7152521 should have done something but ive done it enough by the way your hands were shaking rather waste some time with you
7152522 secretly tape recorded by the fbi on june 25 2006
7152523 discussed ways to get a pipeline bill through the alaska legislature with bill allen an oil services executive accused of providing the senator with about 250 000 in undisclosed financial benefits
7152524 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look you gotta get this done
7152525 my mouth is bigger than my talent and i was 0 4 against ohio state
7152526 i think its great how shes always wearing him so before we bash the bjorn lets please try amp remember that she has other carriers and probably just switches them around depending on where shes going or what he likes
7152527 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7152528 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7152529 voc conhece um atleta longevo quem vive muito s o aquelas velhinhas sedent rias que tomam ch com bolo no fim da tarde
7152530 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7152531 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7152532 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7152533 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7152534 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7152535 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7152536 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7152537 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7152538 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7152539 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7152540 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7152541 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7152542 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7152543 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7152544 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7152545 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7152546 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7152547 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7152548 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7152549 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7152550 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7152551 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7152552 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7152553 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7152554 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7152555 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7152556 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7152557 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7152558 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7152559 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7152560 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7152561 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7152562 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7152563 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7152564 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7152565 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7152566 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7152567 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7152568 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7152569 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7152570 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7152571 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7152572 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7152573 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7152574 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7152575 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7152576 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7152577 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7152578 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7152579 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7152580 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7152581 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7152582 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7152583 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7152584 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7152585 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7152586 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7152587 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7152588 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7152589 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7152590 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7152591 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7152592 por natureza as pessoas s o parecidas pela pr tica tornam se bastante diferentes
7152593 imagino que no futuro as pessoas v o ler sobre n s e v o se admirar com o jeito que a gente arrumou pra n o deixar de se amar

7152599 todas as artes contribuem para a maior de todas as artes a arte de viver
7152600 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7152601 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7152602 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7152603 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7152604 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7152605 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7152606 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7152607 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7152608 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7152609 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7152610 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7152611 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7152612 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7152613 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7152614 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7152615 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7152616 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7152617 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7152618 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7152619 this is a planning took where all things are going
7152620 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7152621 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7152622 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7152623 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7152624 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7152625 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7152626 youre not the right color for me to date you
7152627 dragonfly theres a fantastic sale here you absolutely cant pass this up
7152628 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7152629 senator biden needs to apologize to more than just senator obama every black american deserves an apology these comments are reminiscent of the mentality that necessitated the civil rights movement of the 1960s these comments belittle every success and successful black american in the nation hiding behind one term in a statement whose total purpose is too subtly insult will not fool us the mainstream media may not wish to address this but i will for me senator biden will never get my vote but the underlying thought of his statement cannot be warmed over by platitudes or a plea of a single term misstatement the meaning of the full comment does not change that meaning places me and 14 of america in a second class less than meaningful position i will not accept that of an american president or politician if possible
7152630 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7152631 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7152632 give of your best to master give of the strength of your youth
7152633 jesus has set the example dauntless was he young and brave
7152634 it is only by gods grace that you have been saved
7152635 many times he held back his anger and did not unleash his fury for he remembered that they were merely mortal gone like a breath of wind that never returns
7152636 he heard we were coming back in port he was there to greet us and say thanks
7152637 he told me the biggest thrill he ever had in high school was sacking walt butch hriniak natick highs star quarterback
7152638 they were so impressed they made me an honorary member
7152639 that team ignited a spark you wanted to play for natick high
7152640 i sailed boats around the world from fort lauderdale to south africa
7152641 i turned professional but i was past my prime i became a club pro in south carolina
7152642 he was sixth in ryder cup standings but in the british open hitting a shot out of the rough he hurt his shoulder and that was that
7152643 youre looking for someone to celebrate with and theyre all gone
7152644 generally theres a salary involved enough to take care of travel expenses and what you have to take care of at home the percentage of the golfers winnings thats where you make money
7152645 you go out and get to know the golf course as best you can
7152646 every yardage from every point on the course you need to know how to re grip clubs and clean them you learn how to travel because sometimes after a tournament ends sunday the next day you have to get to a pro am we used to drive now everybody flies traveling is no fun anymore its just horrible
7152647 never miss an opportunity to keep your mouth shut lee trevino said he never saw a jockey carry a horse across the finish line its about the players talent his skills
7152648 ive seen guys walk away from it theres no telling what fred couples might have been he didnt want the spotlight
7152649 hes the king no question about it ive never seen anyone is sports or entertainment who so easily connects with people
7152650 i refuse to figure out how many miles ive walked on a golf course it would floor me
7152651 sto facendo i cannelloni per il criceto di susan vuoi provarli
7152652 ultimo cassetto in alto a destra ultimo cassetto in alto a destra
7152653 ok posso aspettare ma intanto andiamo a dare una sbirciatina a
7152654 che il ragazzo con cui sono uscita fosse la sua ultima fiamma
7152655 diamine mariol perch dici tutte le cose che pensi tienitele in questa bella testolina una volta per tutte niente male tu niente male tu ma come cazzo ti viene in mente di sbatterglielo in faccia no nn arrossire altrimenti capisce nn arrossire nooo diamine perch sta ridendo ora che ha da ridere e pensa a nn arrossire intanto nn arrossireeee d qualcosa evita questo silenzio imbarazzante d qualcosa
7152656 didascalia didascalia ma perch mariol devi essere cos disperatamente imbranata digli solamente che vuoi dargli il suo numero
7152657 oh s mio dio s crusue fatti le pippe quanto ti pare tanto lost diventato il mio telefilm preferito bisogner che chieda qualcosa a larry ma ora corri immediatamente a comprare questa cazzo di torta veloce vaiii
7152658 chiss perch neanche me lo chiede dar per scontato che io lo so lei di certo deve averlo visto sul biglietto che ha pescato ma chiederlo ora dopo pi di due ore che stiamo vicine mi sembra piuttosto imbarazzante
7152659 mmm una tipa strana bisogna che ne sappia di pi bisogna che capisca
7152660 i am el shaddai god almighty serve me faithfully and live a blameless life i will make a covenant with you by which i will guarantee to give you countless descendants
7152661 when i look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers the moon and the stars you set in place what are people that you should think about them mere mortals that you should care for them
7152662 theres a lot of revenue thats made that you cant argue is illegal but fees dont have to be as high as they are
7152663 people feel they have to be nice and that if they upset the person across the table they wont get anything
7152664 a whole industry has grown up making money off families money
7152665 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7152666 most of this is through their management who regard fees as the most important part of the business rather than delivering service or looking after clients
7152667 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month
7152668 the key thing here is we dont charge for work that hasnt been completed
7152669 theres no question that we are a commercial organisation and we have shareholders and we intend to make a profit thats nothing to be ashamed about
7152670 in public trust we did see a real shift from an organisation that was very client centric to very much a revenue and profit driven organisation
7152671 trustee corporations would be similar to any other corporate where the powers that be the executives set their budgets for the organisation and have various ways to cascade that down
7152672 as long as i am chief executive we will never progress to the point of incentivising or creating the expectation of not selling to need
7152673 like many things in new zealand it has been left unattended for a long time
7152674 are estate companies better than each other i dont know but there needs to be a commission of inquiry a full shake out of trust and estate management in new zealand
7152675 is there a problem the fact you sunday star times
7152676 this shoe came straight from the manufacturer nike shoe company
7152677 it was a marketing move we thought it was a pretty interesting strategy the aim was to attract attention the people in the queues told passers by about the iphone
7152678 the aim was to draw peoples attention to the product and to make some buzz around it

7152698 it is no seret that the oilers were very in on gomez on july 1 2007 and i am quite sure that if he becomes available they are in line
7152699 we are hearing that the rangers will sign mats and deal gomez

7152709 we will replace batteries of the first generation ipod nanos with new ones if customers find that the batteries overheat
7152710 we are still investigating the cause of the glitch but weve identified one particular supplier of the batteries
7152711 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
7152712 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country

7152715 i do not have 97 to hand over to the library nor do i think that is a remotely reasonable fee
7152716 i would be very grateful to be able to use the downtown library again but if i cant then i cant
7152717 the disc she lost has been marked as claimed meaning she reported that she had already returned it
7152718 we appreciate that ms cooper wants to be able to use our services again and that she is aware of all that a chicago public library card offers

7152720 freudian slip that it said betrayed the 47 year old senator obamas unreadiness to serve as commander in chief
7152721 obama from the crowd in springfield illinois and a rueful smile from the vp hopeful
7152722 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you one of the aides said
7152723 obama biden banners made their debut in springfield as the 35 000 strong crowd gave a rapturous welcome to the two democrats standing on the same steps where senator obama launched his white house quest back in february 2007
7152724 those who judge minimalism by its appearance alone will call it spartan austere even soulless but art and design are not just about appearances ornamentation is not art great art is about heightening our experiences to me the minimalist aesthetic is the most humanist of all one that elicits the full power of all our senses what le corbusier called the spirit of order a unity of intention is what allows us to see beauty and to take part in the journeys of our own hearts and minds
7152725 death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live
7152726 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7152727 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7152728 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7152729 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7152730 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7152731 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7152732 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7152733 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7152734 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7152735 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7152736 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7152737 standards technologies that are standards because of overwhelming market adoption as opposed to
7152738 standards technologies that are formally voted in as a standard by one body or another the reality is that the technologies that underlie a standard are rarely created in a vacuum and increasingly the lines between
7152739 does the fact that a standard undergoes revisions even frequent mean it wasnt ready to be standardized

7152749 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence

7152752 that locks down the important swing state of delaware and puts the combined fatuous egotism of the ticket into overload territory
7152753 it was a result of our continuing investigation into the trace back of contaminated meats
7152754 because it was such a small quantity we were able to identify the specific stores
7152755 don and i have served together in congress for many years and i consider him a friend
7152756 don has been an outspoken voice against environmental extremists over the years and has strongly opposed the types of federal regulatory overreach advocated in the name of environmentalism
7152757 what seemed like a brilliant exercise in media management devolved into a late night rearguard maneuver
7152758 well i obviously care if i didnt i wouldnt even be talking to you nerds would i
7152759 act to remove federal penalties for personal use of marijuana by responsible adults

7152765 you see that yahat by the pier i paid for that yahat by giving head jobs
7152766 the hand job was good the head job was great how much for the whole package

7152768 well i was playing with the birdy but then it spit this white stuff at me i got really mad so i broke its neck stepped on its eggs and burned its nest
7152769 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
7152770 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7152771 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7152772 had not spent 5 1 2 years in a north vietnamese prisoner of war camp to have his courage or integrity questioned
7152773 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
7152774 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
7152775 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
7152776 un homme mari cest comme un livre la biblioth que on peut lemprunter mais il faut toujours le remettre sa place
7152777 for 30 years i have witnessed congress dangling a carrot in front of amtraks eyes funding it just enough for it to limp along and ill tell you this has to stop now is the time to commit politically and financially to a strong safe and efficient passenger rail system
7152778 to prosecute individuals who intentionally allow mass copying from their computer over peer to peer networks
7152779 update and reform our copyright and patent systems to promote civic discourse innovation and investment while ensuring that intellectual property owners are fairly treated
7152780 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
7152781 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7152782 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime
7152783 authorize the justice department to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations
7152784 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7152785 the democratic partys de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism
7152786 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7152787 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7152788 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7152789 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7152790 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7152791 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7152792 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7152793 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7152794 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7152795 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7152796 video that lists the necessary ingredients and shows some self described rednecks blowing up small plastic bottles in their yard
7152797 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations
7152798 crimes dangerous to the life limb and well being of minor children
7152799 at least one in person medical evaluation of the patient
7152800 to an individual under the age of 18 years including any such sale using the internet
7152801 the chairman will be required to hold this meeting in this largest room in the capitol and there will be lines wandering all the way down to the white house
7152802 our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7152803 there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren
7152804 our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team
7152805 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us
7152806 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
7152807 it is absolute madness in the car industry there are more and more joint ventures only in formula one do we all try to reinvent the wheel
7152808 i dont see many people interested in our gearbox or our suspension or our brakes
7152809 yeah might be my only chance i dont i cant i
7152810 get it right this time harkness and we wont have to do it again
7152811 of course i can im your big brother arent i
7152812 if anyone gets this and gives a fuck there are one hundred and fifty three bodies on floor zero of the game station some of them died to save humanity some of them just died i thought that was important once cant tell which are which now though anyway they probably have families somewhere so come get em if you want em the daleks are dust and im getting the hell out of this tomb heres to the fourth great and bountiful human empire
7152813 doctor if you see this im heading for cardiff late 1969 ill see you there
7152814 captain what are you doing here the meeting with t7 and the prime minister started an hour ago
7152815 have written in areas that seem particularly disfavoured by the canadian legal establishment
7152816 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7152817 that this instrument which we intended to deal with discrimination in housing employment and the provision of goods and services would be used to muzzle the expression of opinion
7152818 tolerance is the highest virtue that goes a long way to account for the spectacle of in tolerance that canada has been offering the world
7152819 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7152820 the us economy is crumbling because the way we conduct the activities of daily life is insane relative to our circumstances
7152821 the association of muslim scholars of iraq and the baath party call for boycott of the provincial elections
7152822 the local elections are part of a strategy being carried out by the united states for the complete partitioning of iraq and their clauses were written into the constitution in order to effectuate the partitioning of iraq by virtue of them and the law on provincial councils is nothing but a confirmation of that strategy
7152823 the law on provincial councils which was the subject of controversy originally between groups and parties participating in the political process is the magic key for the partitioning of iraq into 18 statelets having many dimensions positions and features of partition that are obvious
7152824 people and fresh water are often not in the same place
7152825 we are on a dangerous path water itself is at risk because we tend to overuse it
7152826 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
7152827 cr ticas del gobierno a las ong pretenden esconder su ineficacia en resolver conflictos sociales
7152828 hoy se habla mucho de democracia inclusi n y de di logo pero hay que quitarse las caretas y que cada uno realmente sostenga si cree en el di logo que lo ejerza si cree en la democracia que la viva si cree en la libre discusi n de las ideas que respete y tambi n exponga las suyas y as seremos el pa s que queremos ser
7152829 realmente se ve que a r o revuelto ganancia de pescadores porque salen titulares en los medios de comunicaci n como si todo fuera un festival no se ores son nuestras familias nuestros amigos nuestra realidad y territorio es la estima por este pa s y el deseo de superaci n
7152830 conversar sin interesarse por el resultado de la verdad es entonces quien miente con m s habilidad en las opiniones sobre temas pol ticos econ micos y culturales lo primero de todo es que la verdad tiene que estar encima de la mesa no la ideolog a
7152831 ya no es solo el rendimiento econ mico que debe haberlo sino qu beneficio trae al desarrollo de la zona desde el punto de vista social aqu hablamos de escuelas hospitales desarrollo humano comunicaci n y una serie de aspectos que van a hacer la vida m s humana y al mismo tiempo van a respetar el mbito cultural de las personas
7152832 es perfectamente compatible un buen nivel econ mico una buena situaci n social y al mismo tiempo un cuidado de una calidad de vida
7152833 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7152834 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7152835 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7152836 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7152837 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7152838 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7152839 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7152840 the competition for grain between the worlds 800 million motorists who want to maintain their mobility and its two billion poorest people who are simply trying to survive is emerging as an epic issue
7152841 the use of food as a source of fuel may have serious implications for the demand for food if the expansion of biofuels continues
7152842 it is likely to be even smaller than the disastrous drought ravaged 2006 07 harvest and the worst in more than a decade
7152843 we have already passed the phosphate peak of production for united states 1988 and for the world 1989
7152844 from the studies mentioned above and from an increasing body of case studies it is becoming evident that organic farming does not result in either catastrophic crop losses due to pests nor in dramatically reduced yields
7152845 organic farming can yield up to three times as much food on individual farms in developing countries as conventional methods on the same land
7152846 supermarket shelves were being stripped of staple foods in scenes of panic buying sainsbury asda and safeway reported that some branches were having to ration bread and milk
7152847 filmed in hawaii california australia new zealand and peru poster features a great picture of aussie bob pike on a huge wall at laniakea misspelled l
7152848 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
7152849 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
7152850 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
7152851 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
7152852 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
7152853 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
7152854 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
7152855 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
7152856 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant
7152857 were sorry this site cant be embedded in a frame
7152858 were sorry this site cant be embedded in a frame
7152859 i loved it when roy orbison said i may be a living legend but that sure dont help when ive got to change a flat tire
7152860 its easier i dont need to prepare everything i say reminds me of something else just give me three minute sign at the end and i can wrap it up
7152861 if i were ever persecuted for my religion i truly hope their would be enough evidence to convict me
7152862 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7152863 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7152864 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7152865 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7152866 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7152867 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7152868 the invite page will continue to have invite your friends across networks
7152869 the invite page will continue to have invite your friends across networks
7152870 did we succeed in setting off two security alarms back there
7152871 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7152872 und wenn sie mich beim kehren rund um eine neu aufgestellte skulptur fotografieren es passt ich mache hier ja fast alles
7152873 die werken schon l nger als 2 jahre an der sache das muss fertig werden bis 6 september
7152874 zwei millionen betriebskosten im jahr ich denke nur an die fu bodenheizung ein wahnsinn
7152875 wie das mit 40 oder 80 kronen eintritt pro kopf einnehmen
7152876 was geld verdient ist kunst das arbeiten an sich ist kunst und gutes gesch ft ist die beste kunst
7152877 die sterreicher verraten nicht woher sie diese fantastischen vitrinen haben ich m chte wissen wo die gemacht werden sie zu kaufen k me billiger als sie immer anzumieten
7152878 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7152879 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are

7152888 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
7152889 it is all a part of one and the same great truth
7152890 so clinging perfumes that it hung long in the hair and beard of those about
7152891 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
7152892 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately

7152900 one must learn to love and go through a good deal of suffering to get to it and the journey is always towards the other soul
7152901 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
7152902 our aggressive military activities in afghanistan are foolish and wrong
7152903 the pashtun people have extremely different values than ours values we may not agree with in any case but its not our business to try and teach them lessons with weapons
7152904 we are seeking to confirm media reports that an australian has allegedly been kidnapped near mogadishu in somalia
7152905 of widespread armed conflict very high threat of terrorist attack against western interests
7152906 there is a very high threat of terrorist attack in somalia
7152907 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu foreigners including australians have been kidnapped
7152908 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
7152909 better than everybody else you dont know my state my state was a slave state my state is a border state my state is the eighth largest black population in the country my state is anything from a northeast liberal state
7152910 slave state that fought beside the north thats only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way
7152911 in 2004 sen john kerry referred to sikhs as terrorists and sen hillary clinton jokingly referred to mahatma gandhi as a gas station owner
7152912 a clear double standard in the mainstream media will likely ensure sen biden gets a pass over these comments that would get a republican in deep trouble if he ever made a similar statement
7152913 hey my love it seems your eyes are troubled care to share your time with me would you say youre feeling low and so a good idea would be to get if off your mind see you and me have a better time than most can dream of make it better than the best so you can pull on through whatever tears at us whatever holds us down and if nothing can be done well make the best of whats around
7152914 if you cant get rid of the skeleton in your closet youd best teach it to dance
7152915 our mission as late night at the peif is to redefine partying at nmu
7152916 especially since everybody has the negative connotation that partying at college is a lot of alcohol and were trying to go against that and say guess what you dont need alcohol
7152917 weve just got to dissect everything figure out whats going on go to work thats the only thing you can do
7152918 we were mad about different things in 2007 that were going on it still bothers me weve got to go out there and sign our name to something make a statement early on set our reputation for the year
7152919 they havent even had a test yet theyre still studying
7152920 its like theyve got their tutors their coach and theyre building up to it but now its time to play and put it out there and find out who we are
7152921 everybody talks about who they are in preseason nobody really knows unless youve got 20 starters back from last year or something and you still dont know how theyre going to react but you at least have seen them before

7152934 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7152935 her condition was serious and at this moment the only thing we can do is support the family on their pain
7152936 it was tough to get here but it was worth it
7152937 i knew before coming that it would be worth it
7152938 i didnt think the ball was going to go in it took forever
7152939 if you have someone who has experience with other operating systems i dont think its all that difficult switching over to linux
7152940 conceptually the commands are the same the structure is similar its just learning what the exact commands are to accomplishing various tasks
7152941 another skill in linux is you have to be willing to ask other people for help
7152942 we came in at six oclock last night and heard absolutely nothing
7152943 this is not a big enough posting not at all
7152944 there should be a big sign and a gate coming in here

7153216 we will work closely with these independent reviewers to ensure that all issues are dealt with comprehensively and expeditiously and we are quite confident that when all is said and done the end result will be the same as the previous investigations and audits
7153217 implies that operator error was responsible for the mammoth hydraulic pump failures
7153218 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and catastrophic failures of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job

7153232 let me lay my cards on the table if i were to give an award for the single best idea anyone has ever had id give it to darwin ahead of newton and einstein and everyone else
7153233 i must say that in that little study at our home in regency street and in my research room at barts i had some remarkable experiences it was entirely gods doing i have known what it is to be really filled with a joy unspeakable and full of glory
7153234 i have never spoken in tongues either in private or in public
7153235 the memory of that night never faded for those who were present
7153236 suddenly this man was entirely transformed his voice deepened a power came into it even in his speech and he prayed in the freest most powerful manner i have ever heard in my life the prayer meeting continued without intermission and the freedom that had accompanied this mans prayer was given to all the others one felt that one was outside time that one was in heaven one was really lifted up to the spiritual realm
7153237 it gives clarity of thought clarity of speech ease of utterance a great sense of authority and confidence as you are preaching an awareness of a power not your own thrilling through the whole of your being and an indescribable sense of joy you are a man possessed you are taken hold of and taken up i like to put it like this and i know of nothing on earth that is comparable to this feeling that when this happens you have a feeling that you are not actually doing the preaching you are looking on you are looking on at yourself in amazement as this is happening it is not your effort you are just the instrument the channel the vehicle and the spirit is using you and you are looking on in great enjoyment and astonishment there is nothing that is in any way comparable to this that is what the preacher himself is aware of what about the people they sense it at once they can tell the difference immediately they are gripped they become serious they are convicted they are moved they are humbled some are convicted of sin others are lifted up to the heavens anything may happen to any one of them they know at once tha t something quite unusual and exceptional is happening as a result they begin to delight in the things of god and they want more and more teaching
7153238 it is not for me to say anything about the paper all i shall say is this the people who count at charing cross all liked it while i myself was moved to an extent that i have never experienced before
7153239 there is thus no successor to the apostles by definition there never can be or has been a successor to the apostles
7153240 there is one thing i have looked for and longed for and desired
7153241 i approach the next matter with much hesitation and a sense of utter unworthiness i suppose we all fail at this next point more than anywhere else that is in the matter of prayer prayer is vital to the life of the preacher read the biographies and the auto biographies of the greatest preachers throughout the centuries and you will find that this has always been the great characteristic of their lives they were always great men of prayer and they spent considerable time in prayer i could quote many examples but i must refrain as there are so many and they are well known these men found that this was absolutely essential and that it became increasingly so as they went on i have always hesitated to deal with this subject i have preached on prayer when it has come in a passage through which i have been working but i have never presumed to produce a book on prayer or even a booklet certain people have done this in a very mechanical manner taking us through the different aspects and classifying it all it all seems so simple but prayer is not simple there is an element of discipline in prayer of course but it surely cannot be dealt with in that way because of its very nature all i would say is this and again i am speaking here from personal experience that once more it is very important for one to know ones self in this matter whether this is a sign of a lack of deep spirituality or not i do not know i do not think it is but i confess that i have found it difficult to start praying in the morning i have come to learn certain things about private prayer you cannot pray to order you can get on your knees to order but how to pray i have found nothing more important than to learn how to get oneself into that frame and condition in which one can pray you have to learn how to start yourself off and it is just here that this knowledge of yourself is so important what i have generally found is that to read something which can be characterized in general as devotional is of great value by devotional i do not mean something sentimental i mean something with a true element of worship in it notice that i do not say that you should start yourself in prayer by always reading the scriptures because you can have precisely the same difficulty there start by reading something that will warm your spirit get rid of a coldness that may have developed in your spirit you have to learn how to kindle a flame in your spirit to warm yourself up to give yourself a start it is comparable if you like to starting a car when it is cold you have to learn how to use a spiritual choke i have found it most rewarding to do that and not to struggle vainly when one finds oneself in this condition and that it is difficult to pray do not struggle in prayer for the time being but read something that will warm and stimulate you and you will find that it will put you into a condition in which you will be able to pray more freely but i am not suggesting for a moment quite the reverse that your praying should be confined only to the morning when you start your work in your study prayer should be going on throughout the day prayer need not of necessity be long it can be brief just an ejaculation at ti mes is a true prayer that is surely what the apostle paul means in his exhortation in 1 thessalonians 5 17 pray without ceasing that does not mean that you should be perpetually on your knees but that you are always in a prayerful condition as you are walking along a road or while you are working in your study you turn frequently to god in prayer above all and this i regard as most important of all always respond to every impulse to pray the impulse to pray may come when you are reading or when you are battling with a text i would make an absolute law of this always obey such an impulse where does it come from it is the work of the holy spirit it is a part of the meaning of work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure phil 2 12 13 this often leads to some of the most remarkable experiences in the life of the minister so never resist never postpone it never push it aside because you are busy give yourself to it yield to it and you will find not only that you have not been wasting time with respect to the matter with which you are dealing but that actually it has helped you greatly in that respect you will experience an ease and a facility in understanding what you were reading in thinking in ordering matter for a sermon in writing in everything which is quite astonishing such a call to prayer must never be regarded as a distraction always respond to it immediately and thank god if it happens to you frequently from every standpoint the minister the preacher must be a man of prayer this is constantly emphasized in the pastoral epistles and elsewhere and as i say it is confirmed abundantly in the long history of the church and especially in the lives of the outstanding preachers john wesley used to say that he thought very little of a man who did not pray four hours every day nothing stands out so clearly likewise in the lives of people like david brainerd and jonathan edwards robert murray mccheyne and a host of other saints that is why one is so humbled as one reads the stories of such men

7153251 many individuals simply dont understand that business and professional fields are becoming more like the radio business
7153252 they stay current get new ideas to follow up on and earn the respect of their teams with that respect the team members are more likely to work harder for the boss
7153253 people are becoming less likely to sit back quietly while their boss steals ideas or takes credit for great ideas which werent their own

7153265 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7153266 i cant seem to figure out who i am suppose to see i need to get some information who normally makes the real buying decisions in your office regarding xyz and how can i get in to see them

7153274 i know this sound nuts but i have been asked to get with someone who knows and graph your paperwork flow do you know what i mean i dont either but it is my job will you help me try
7153275 most people will talk freely and proudly about their lifes work

7153290 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7153291 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7153292 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7153293 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7153294 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7153295 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

7153298 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail
7153299 such a warning from the environment agency must be taken extremely seriously the failure of just one container could prove catastrophic
7153300 absence of robust arguments which demonstrate that this target is achievable in practice
7153301 that are not expected to be durable over periods of hundreds of years
7153302 it is not clear how package integrity during storage can be assured over the extended timescales now being suggested
7153303 if we are going to dispose of the waste this should be done as quickly as reasonably possible
7153304 it makes sense to address all gases that lead to climate change
7153305 the more gases you cover the greater flexibility countries have
7153306 very little is known about sources current and future emissions and atmospheric abundance of these gases
7153307 emissions in 1990 are assumed to have been close to zero but are increasing exponentially
7153308 in principle increase the demand for tradable units under the kyoto protocol
7153309 there are not big amounts of these new gases emitted now but many parties want to ensure that there are no increases

7153311 weve definitely lost 20 percent of the population this year and probably more

7153314 bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now outweigh the costs
7153315 g lobal warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070
7153316 unlike even moderate co2 cuts which cost more than they do good we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low carbon energy

7153321 moreover protection of red list species which includes the far eastern leopards did not fall under the remit of any of the other agencies
7153322 this announcement marks the culmination of five years of hard work by wwf
7153323 this is a real opportunity for the leopard population in the region to gain a foothold and pull themselves up from the brink of extinction
7153324 any construction in the region should take into consideration the fragile state of this leopard population

7153331 cost pressures and complexity introduced by technologies like virtualization make accurate dependable capacity planning a critical capability for todays cio capacity manager makes accurate capacity and budget planning a reality for virtually any organization
7153332 capacity planning is a solution to maintaining business service quality and avoiding the consequences of downtime and brownouts and no longer a way to maintain a minimum level of service at the lowest possible cost
7153333 as data centers struggle with server consolidation and server virtualization capacity planning becomes the key to maintaining or improving service quality while containing costs

7153338 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7153339 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7153340 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7153341 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7153342 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7153343 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7153344 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7153345 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7153346 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7153347 its expected maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7153348 some guys will talk about the guys who didnt make the trip and did not play
7153349 but they had guys who did not play as well so you cant use that as an excuse

7153405 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7153406 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7153407 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7153408 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7153409 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7153410 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7153411 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7153412 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7153413 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7153414 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7153415 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7153416 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7153417 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7153418 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7153419 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7153420 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7153421 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7153422 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7153423 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7153424 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7153425 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7153426 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7153427 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7153428 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7153429 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7153430 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7153431 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7153432 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7153433 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7153434 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7153435 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7153436 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7153437 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7153438 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7153439 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7153440 if we werent doing patrols it wouldnt be as calm as it is
7153441 in the end we are making a difference because were establishing control
7153442 most of the time the people like us being there they like the security
7153443 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7153444 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7153445 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7153446 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7153447 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7153448 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7153449 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7153450 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7153451 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7153452 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7153453 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7153454 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7153455 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7153456 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7153457 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7153458 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7153459 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7153460 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7153461 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7153462 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7153463 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7153464 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7153465 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7153466 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7153467 my adoptive parents are not strangers its always repeated about how babies are handed to strangers after growing in someone elses womb complete strangers virtual strangers awful strangers my parents are not strangers to me you are not a stranger to squirt
7153468 its not being adopted that makes my life complicated its the minefield of everyones expectations of me that is constantly maiming me
7153469 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7153470 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7153471 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7153472 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7153473 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7153474 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7153475 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7153476 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7153477 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7153478 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7153479 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7153480 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7153481 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7153482 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7153483 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7153484 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7153485 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7153486 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7153487 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7153488 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7153489 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7153490 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7153491 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7153492 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7153493 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7153494 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7153495 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7153496 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7153497 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7153498 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7153499 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7153500 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7153501 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7153502 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7153503 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7153504 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7153505 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7153506 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7153507 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7153508 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7153509 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7153510 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7153511 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7153512 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7153513 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7153514 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7153515 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7153516 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7153517 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7153518 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7153519 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7153520 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7153521 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7153522 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7153523 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7153524 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7153525 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7153526 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7153527 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7153528 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7153529 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7153530 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7153531 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7153532 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7153533 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7153534 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7153535 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7153536 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7153537 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7153538 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7153539 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7153540 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7153541 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7153542 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7153543 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7153544 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7153545 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7153546 it is home to the under 9s through to the under 18s with each age group having their own changing rooms although while the scholars will be based there they will still have lunch in the main building in order to continue building a good relationship with both first team players and reserves
7153547 still the new building has its own kitchen and many of the same facilities as the main building the only difference is the amenities in the new building are dedicated to the needs of the academy
7153548 the new building also allows local communities to maintain involvement with the cobham grounds as they play weekend matches there as well as permitting the academys management structure and football in the communitys 136 coaches to work alongside one another
7153549 the community replacement building now means the 140 acre site can accommodate all elements of football from the elite through to the local communitys weekend games
7153550 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7153551 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7153552 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7153553 cela dit nous navons pas couch ensemble ce me semble ou jai un trou de m moire
7153554 what women get from men dick take it anyway you like it
7153555 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7153556 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7153557 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7153558 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7153559 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7153560 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7153561 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7153562 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7153563 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7153564 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7153565 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7153566 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7153567 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7153568 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7153569 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7153570 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7153571 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7153572 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7153573 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7153574 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7153575 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7153576 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7153577 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7153578 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7153579 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7153580 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7153581 identity is who you are image is how you are viewed by others both influence the choices that you make but identity offers much greater longer term rewards whenever possible base your key life decisions on the person that you are
7153582 the identity of one changes with how one perceives reality
7153583 identity is such a crucial affair that one shouldnt rush into it
7153584 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7153585 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7153586 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7153587 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7153588 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7153589 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7153590 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7153591 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7153592 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7153593 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7153594 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7153595 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7153596 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7153597 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7153598 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7153599 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7153600 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7153601 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7153602 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7153603 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7153604 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7153605 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7153606 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7153607 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7153608 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7153609 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7153610 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7153611 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7153612 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7153613 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7153614 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7153615 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7153616 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7153617 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7153618 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7153619 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7153620 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7153621 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7153622 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7153623 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7153624 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7153625 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7153626 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7153627 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7153628 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7153629 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7153630 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7153631 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7153632 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7153633 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7153634 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7153635 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7153636 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7153637 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7153638 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7153639 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination

7153641 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7153642 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7153643 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7153659 i was with some people this morning they said did you hear
7153660 the fact is when some of the most important republicans in the senate are praising joe biden it shows they respect that
7153661 sen biden has been well tested he has great foreign policy experience
7153662 i really think a lot of americans will say those two are washington insiders on the ticket
7153663 they also privately admit joe biden is their worst nightmare they know he will have strong republican support
7153664 his values are firmly rooted in the middle class along with his foreign policy experience he will be complimentary to moving this country forward for the change that we need this election season and the next four years
7153665 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well

7153680 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7153681 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now

7153706 i actually just looked at it for a while i just held it there and i laid it across my bed and i just stared at it for a few minutes just because as a kid growing up this is the ultimate ultimate in basketball
7153707 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that youre fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
7153708 no its a cool thing for me to say i feel great about it and im not ashamed to say it i mean this is a tremendous honor
7153709 im just trying to get an opinion on what i need to do how bad the injury is and if i can do anything to play
7153710 im going to do the best i can to get back on the field and get ready for carolina
7153711 if its turbo i get a bigger kick out of it
7153712 thats why most of my cars have turbos theyre just that much more fun to drive
7153713 thats what this type of racing was all about back in the day
7153714 its going to be awesome hopefully well be in good shape it will be fun
7153715 theyre going to change the cars too so it will be a big challenge
7153716 i dont know what else will change but im sure that wont be all and for those of us who have gotten used to naturally aspirated engines it will be a major difference were going to have to get used to it again
7153717 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7153718 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7153719 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7153720 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7153721 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7153722 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7153723 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points

7153746 yes but ive been meaning to tell you for a while i just havent had the time
7153747 there are certain times namely when we are in a negative emotional state that any desire to make a decision that could potentially change the state of the union should be held off for more rational times
7153748 i remember what you did and its not okay no matter how much you regret doing it

7153751 how can we make an optimal use of this f ims we spent so much f money on
7153752 an ims communication service is a type of communication defined by a service definition that specifies the rules and procedures and allowed medias for a specific type of communication and that utilises the ims enablers
7153753 communication services are fine with me as long as as an operator i can use them when i see an interest for it and not use them when i do not see any
7153754 as perceived by the user should be consistent with the behavior perceived when using the equivalent services on pstn isdn and cs mobile networks
7153755 how likely are you to recommend this company to a colleague
7153756 single most reliable indicator of a companys ability to grow
7153757 reichhelds claims are grossly overstated with regard to the merits of the net promoter score despite the scientific research criticizing the nps claims the nps developers still presses the claim that the nps is the best predictor of company growth
7153758 already more tools and applications such as office software e mail and customer relationship management are being served from such centres and we can expect the range of applications and services available to grow
7153759 i get kind of sad when im asked about what customers can do to secure their crm applications
7153760 one question you can ask is how are you in compliance about the owasp top 10 how are passwords stored what type of access rules do you enforce is there some kind of access control system ask how granular it is a lot of times looking at feature set of an application can give you an idea of how secure it is
7153761 businesses could find an effective crm approach will give them an important competitive advantage under recessionary conditions
7153762 offers marketing sales and service decision makers independent realistic understanding of how their business strategies will be influenced by and can take advantage of the evolution of it
7153763 creating and sustaining an agile process powered organization and explains how to align business strategy and it to maximize operational agility providing new opportunities to expand revenues and productivity
7153764 single place within the crm system to capture and analyze relevant customer data
7153765 leading edge of a movement to shift the focus from the transaction to the customer
7153766 the fact that crm has been rather successful despite this deficiency says more about the market lifecycle than it does about our ability to know the customer
7153767 a database for tracking customer demographic information that can be maintained by the customer as well as the vendor much like a social networking site a community interface through which the company could ask its customer base about product innovation messaging and anything else relevant to how the customer consumes its products and services this interface a kind of customer laboratory would support typical bidirectional interactions with customers as well as one to many interactions for example a company could collect data while individuals interact to trade information about their use of that companys products and services analytics to slice and dice the data generated by the community a mechanism for rewarding good customer behavior repeat purchases or contributions in the community
7153768 in 2005 36 000 new products hit the market and by early 2006 80 percent of them were projected to fail i doubt its much different today
7153769 catchphrase that many new technologies use to make the web appear a friendlier more powerful place and help users be more productive
7153770 unfortunately the phrase makes identity thieves crackers phishers and other criminals more industrious as well web 2 0 does not so much introduce new kinds of computer crime as it exposes new vulnerabilities to old types of criminal activity
7153771 doing so takes some awareness and a certain amount of technical sophistication but it is not difficult
7153772 all of a sudden in the last five six years predators figured this out that these elderly people have a lot of financial gain and it just evolved
7153773 not to say there still isnt a lot of nursing home abuse thats sadly still continuing but definitely the evolution has been to this financial sector

7153781 all restoring and no play makes johnny a dull boy
7153782 just download a free app from the app store and restart it worked for me
7153783 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
7153784 oh how cute it thinks it has something to tell me
7153785 how many 3rd party apps do you have on your phone
7153786 five only five well talk again when you have over 50 five gimmie a break
7153787 now i am deleting apps from the phone and they are coming back on after a reboot
7153788 none of the apps from app store load and all my media files disappearing from the ipod
7153789 cultural and behavioral barriers regarding accurately charging patients for services rendered
7153790 inefficient contracting process missing sense of urgency and accountability lack of aggressiveness with vendors
7153791 its particularly difficult if youre being asked to change and you know a new leader is coming and he may ask you to change yet again
7153792 in the rest of this year its going to be a challenge to hit those targets
7153793 it would be my hope to renegotiate every contract because they all cost money
7153794 and its like anything else when you dont need them you want to wind them down
7153795 commercially valuable plans proposals and strategies that are of competitive advantage

7153808 being a part of the game on sunday is the biggest thing for me ever
7153809 when i got to the nba finals i thought that was big but winning an nba championship would never compare to winning a gold medal for my country
7153810 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7153811 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7153812 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7153813 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7153814 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7153815 it doesnt matter if you win or loose as long as we beat new zealand
7153816 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7153817 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7153818 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7153819 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7153820 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7153821 gee the value is too large better stuff each byte into the receiving value sequentially
7153822 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7153823 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7153824 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7153825 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7153826 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it

7153828 surtout pas tu vas en avoir 7 ou 10 cest selon autres qui vont appara tre
7153829 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7153830 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7153831 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7153832 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7153833 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7153834 because the rules are different i dont think it hurts you
7153835 so from our standpoint we would like to see our guards play in space as opposed to seeing them covered and our center covered so i dont think its a downside when you get kind of mix and match a little bit
7153836 i should have stopped and filled up before i left
7153837 surely there has to be a house not far ahead
7153838 yes sir i ran out of gas and i was trying to get to a phone do you have a phone i can use

7153885 we were pretty disappointed with our record early in the season and we knew we were a lot better team on defence than we had shown
7153886 it was up to us to change that to make no excuses to get out there and do it it was about everyone buying in
7153887 theyve adapted to the conditions very well and it looks as though they have done a lot of work on their defence and come up with some pretty sound tactics they seem a pretty happy side and they want to work for each other the introduction of some young players with self motivation and energy has really helped
7153888 it used to remind me of a holiday station the way it was earlier in the year if they carry on the same way today as they have been doing you will see the markers playing a far more significant role
7153889 one noticeable change is how the players are on the balls of their feet in the defensive line theyve gone from being flat footed and thats nothing but attitude
7153890 we havent worried over the last eight weeks about what others are doing if you did youd be in a bit of trouble
7153891 and now it is up to ourselves we have a little bit of control
7153892 we want to put that myth to bed as we have so many others
7153893 hes one of the biggest wingers in the comp hes showed that when hes on he can tear apart any team some people talk about the fact he drops the ball occasionally but the problem is that when a bloke like him gets his game and confidence up nothing can stop him
7153894 im hoping he has a sound game but hopefully i have a better game than him ive got my hands full this week
7153895 no me importa esta medalla yo quer a el oro

7153897 if you have someone who has experience with other operating systems i dont think its all that difficult switching over to linux
7153898 conceptually the commands are the same the structure is similar its just learning what the exact commands are to accomplishing various tasks
7153899 another skill in linux is you have to be willing to ask other people for help
7153900 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgement there were a number of people that took offence to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7153901 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7153902 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7153903 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7153904 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7153905 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7153906 that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him

7153911 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7153912 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7153913 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7153914 i told him if hes going to compete hes going to have days like this
7153915 its not the last time its going to happen to him in his life its a good learning experience
7153916 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7153917 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7153918 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7153919 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7153920 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7153921 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7153922 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7153923 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7153924 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7153925 its expected maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7153926 some guys will talk about the guys who didnt make the trip and did not play
7153927 but they had guys who did not play as well so you cant use that as an excuse
7153928 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7153929 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
7153930 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7153931 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7153932 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7153933 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7153934 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7153935 its always at the back of your mind especially as someone who owns a business you wonder whether to keep building and reinvesting
7153936 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7153937 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7153938 we are living here and we believe we will continue to live here and make wine here
7153939 its a tragedy there because there are two nations in one place
7153940 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7153941 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7153942 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7153943 well be angry well be against it but we wont shoot at the israeli army we are not gaza or hebron
7153944 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7153945 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a real peace treaty so we have good support
7153946 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarization open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7153947 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay
7153948 if there is real peace well welcome syrian riders to ramot ranch
7153949 im a zionist and israel is my home but if i have to leave here ill be bitter im sure ill be bitter

7153958 where hes wrong is that we went into iraq at the invitation of the government not as an invasion
7153959 the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars to be treated and appreciated by their nation

7153966 if anything i said cast a negative light on our fine men and women in the military

7153968 everything is looked at from his life experiences from always having been in the military
7153969 going into homes of iraqis in the dead of night terrorizing kids and children
7153970 if you study hard and you do your homework you can do well if you dont you get stuck in iraq
7153971 if you have doubts about the mainstream medias stranglehold on what most americans view and read and the willingness of the media to go to any lengths to make sure your news is only what supports their political views and candidates then you need to read to set the record straight by scott swett and tim ziegler a detailed account of how vietnam veterans led by the example of the swift boat veterans and pows for truth left john kerrys 2004 campaign up the creek without a paddle

7153981 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7153982 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7153983 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7153984 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7153985 its just weird i mean something happened to make this guy veer left off the runway

7154014 we should thus enthusiastically recognise family based commitment and the support that family members give each other wherever it is encountered we ought in particular applaud rather than denigrate those who make personal sacrifices to rear their children especially where they do so as lone parents we ought to encourage and facilitate non custodial parents who take an active part in the rearing of their children

7154016 a senior pastor must be one who rules his own house well having his children in submission with all reverence for if a man does not know how to rule his own house how will he take care of the church of god
7154017 i am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured
7154018 these misdeeds which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust deserve unequivocal condemnation
7154019 those responsible for these evils must be brought to justice
7154020 akinyemi akinpelu too slipped between the cracks in july 2005 he was found dead in his council flat in wythenshawe by a group of boys playing football his body had been there for 10 weeks when the police came there were no sheets on his bed and his clothes were in suitcases on the floor he was 34 and had been living in manchester for less than three years akinyemi had come to the uk from nigeria in 1995 to take a masters degree in ocean engineering at university college london femi adeyemi who was on the same course said that he had ambitions to return to his village to set up his own engineering company he told me that when he came he had 10 000 cash in his suitcase that was the money his father gave him from nigeria but 10 000 was not enough to meet his living costs and tuition fees akinyemi dropped out later enrolling on similar courses at aberdeen and glasgow universities and finally at manchester where he was given an outstanding grade for his dissertation each time he was unable to cover the costs required to complete his degree there was a stack of letters from debt collectors in his flat his passport records showed that he was allowed to stay in the uk only until 2002 at the time of his death akinyemi was liable for deportation deliberately perhaps he faded from view his last known human contact was a trip to the co op on 1 may 2005 to buy four cans of mushy peas and two litres of milk he never made it back to nigeria sandra and akinyemi were comparatively young to die
7154021 originally i wondered whether it would be possible for a person to know no one in this day and age with facebook and social networks we are so over connected it sometimes seems that we can have too many friends but sandra and aki did cut themselves off and that seems to be something about the way we live now in the old days you would know someone had died because the milk bottles would pile up on the doorstep now with so much more online shopping we seem to be cutting down the need for human contact
7154022 do not ask us what we can do for you on returning back to nigeria as we promised you nothing when you left
7154023 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that mr tanner told the ten network
7154024 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7154025 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape he said
7154026 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly

7154033 in terms of nervousness the toughest match of the week was against benesova in the semifinals its always difficult to play someone from your own country
7154034 in terms of the tennis todays match with peng was my best match i just tried to concentrate from the very first ball i knew i had to serve well and i did that in both sets i was also trying to control the points when i could because when shes aggressive and in control shes very tough to play
7154035 i really enjoy it here its a very calm place and i have great memories from my first title here
7154036 i was injured at the beginning of the year and havent had my best results but this week has helped me regain my confidence in time for the us open ill celebrate this win and just look forward to new york
7154037 anna was playing really aggressive i was playing into her game too
7154038 i was thinking if i win this tournament i have to play my own game and make her do the things i want her to do i realized id lose if i didnt change something anyway so i just tried to change my tactics and it worked
7154039 i just didnt have enough power especially in the third set its quite important that youre able to run and fight on the court if you cant do that youre going to lose
7154040 i won quite a few matches and im actually pleased with my game except for today
7154041 if i compare the way i played to one month ago its much better im looking forward to playing the us open its the most important tournament ill get a day off in between each match so hopefully i can stay fresh for each one
7154042 my first title was in scandinavia but it was smaller than this
7154043 this is a really big tournament before the us open and i beat some really great players to win it im just happy to have won both tournaments

7154205 e stata una partita stregata nel senso che noi abbiamo offerto diverse occasioni ma purtroppo non siamo riusciti a concretizzarle effettivamente ci sono state alcune sbavature comunque fra sette giorni inizia il campionato ed importante essere pronti per la sfida contro la reggina squadra tosta ed ostica che dovremo affrontare con grande grinta concentrazione
7154206 e stata una partita strana proprio perch quando crei diverse occasioni da gol prima o poi le concretizzi
7154207 effettivamente stato un risultato che non pensavo di raggiungere comunque godiamoci questo momento ma non montiamoci la testa perch il padova rientra in un altra dimensione infatti noi da marted dovremo calarci subito per la prima di campionato dove affronteremo una trasferta insidiosa come quella di legnano comunque sono consapevole di avere una squadra competitiva dove stato mantenuto lo zoccolo duro della passata stagione con linnesto di giocatori giovani che stanno dimostrando di essersi ben amalgamati
7154208 sono soddisfatto del passaggio del turno tra i tanti bene izco e paolucci ma voglio esser sincero mi piace di pi parlare delle condizioni generale della mia squadra oggi ho fatto giocare chi di pi mi ha convinto in questa ultima fase del ritiro comunque nessuno si deve preoccupare c posto per tutti capita quando si ha una rosa di venticinque giocatori che qualcuno possa rimanerci male quando non gioca il campionato ancora lungo ripeto ci sar posto per tutti adesso ci godiamo questo importante passaggio del terzo turno di coppa italia ed incominciamo a pensare allesordio in campionato
7154209 quando si vince va sempre bene siamo soddisfatti perch abbiamo giocato e vinto contro una squadra fortissima che merita sicuramente la serie a ovviamente non guardiamo solo al risultato positivo che ovviamente ci gratifica ma che deve stimolarci per lavorare ancora e migliorare in prospettiva del campionato anche se la condizione fisica pare che sia buona dato che abbiamo corso sino al fischio finale infine voglio ringraziare il pubblico che ci emoziona sempre e sempre uno spettacolo vedere quanti tifosi ci seguono ad ogni occasione
7154210 sono felice per la vittoria del catania e soddisfatto a livello personale un esordio cos lo immaginavo e me lo auguravo anche se devo ringraziare i miei compagni peppe mascara e mariano izco che mi hanno servito perfettamente adesso devo continuare a lavorare per raggiungere una condizione fisica ottimale non sono ancora al 100 i miei goal non sono un messaggio al mister io faccio il mio lavoro e se il mister ha bisogno di me sar pronto ad ogni occasione

7154220 you know you were ten miles from the alabama border and if those news media people hadnt been there you might never have been heard from again
7154221 here are the documents and if you do not withdraw the suit i will sue you

7154322 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
7154323 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
7154324 these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7154325 countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere
7154326 we know what the expectations are and i dont think theyre unfair
7154327 this is ohio state weve got a lot of guys back
7154328 the general feeling you have at ohio state is that youre always expected to win every game you pick up jack parks history books and you feel like ohio state never lost a game that woody hayes never lost a game
7154329 youve got a big race to run that never ends thats just what it is but its exciting
7154330 basically it was just that im having fun right now i wasnt ready to make football a job yet
7154331 wherever you go thats all people want to talk about is that third game
7154332 the past doesnt matter what happened 20 years ago isnt going to get you a first down today
7154333 they illinois players understand that the mood out there is last year just a one and done year for illinois
7154334 so its going to be a great challenge for us
7154335 you have to win you have to prove you can win to create that excitement and i think thats what we did last fall
7154336 out of our top 46 47 guys probably only a third of them i could put in ink where theyre going to be
7154337 from the standpoint of all the questions about a so called outside guy coming in i have not heard that at all from my fans maybe theyve said it behind closed doors but the places ive been to and talked to michigan fans theyve been terrific
7154338 i think if you dont talk about championships within your football team and within your program youre doing your players a disservice and selling them short our goal will be to win the big ten championship this season
7154339 we scored some points and ran the ball fairly well last season what we didnt do was stop anybody we went out and recruited defensive football players twenty one of the 31 kids we signed are defensive players we feel like weve recruited one of the top recruiting classes in the country
7154340 ive got high expectations for this team i like where were at right now i believe were poised to hopefully take another step this year
7154341 we always say to our seniors if you have a career best year we have a chance we have 25 seniors if they have career best years we have a chance
7154342 i suppose the fact that we were able to bring the purdue program back from the depths to being very competitive
7154343 any coach will tell you that if you can get a team to play with a little bit of an edge or a little bit of a chip on its shoulder thats something that can make you overcome certain deficiencies

7154399 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
7154400 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
7154401 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
7154402 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7154403 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7154404 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
7154405 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
7154406 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
7154407 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
7154408 if an acquirer could buy sun at a discounted price and then execute or facilitate the turnaround that has been close or elusive for sun it could represent a significant payoff
7154409 i applaud the choice of senator joe biden as the next vice president of the united states his long experience in public service will wonderfully complement senator obamas strengths as a leader
7154410 through the years senator biden has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7154411 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7154412 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7154413 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7154414 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7154415 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7154416 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7154417 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7154418 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7154419 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7154420 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7154421 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7154422 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7154423 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7154424 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7154425 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7154426 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7154427 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7154428 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7154429 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7154430 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7154431 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7154432 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7154433 who are open to doing something on the production side
7154434 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7154435 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7154436 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7154437 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7154438 it has loose clusters and works well here because we have some fungus issues
7154439 im just trying to make wine people can enjoy were certainly not a snob winery were making mostly reds in fact i made my first white wine this year
7154440 it goes well with steak or barbecue i dont believe in heavy oak i want my wines to be approachable and easy drinking
7154441 i retired in 1996 and started taking some wine making courses at grayson college home of the t v munson viticulture and enology center in 2000 my wife and i took a short course through grayson that took us to europe we kind of got hooked on winemaking during that trip we came home and planted an acre of cabernet sauvignon neither one of us had ever made a drop of wine before that
7154442 i knew nothing about wines when i started taking courses
7154443 i certainly didnt start my winery the right way most people make small batches for years i jumped in and started making tanksful of wine i certainly lost some tanks and some money but since we were growing our own grapes it wasnt that bad
7154444 now were making a little wine lots of friends and no money
7154445 im trying to do some things right were trying to grow a little but slowly
7154446 the winery is a barn type structure it was originally meant to be a barn but when the legislation passed we turned it into the winery there main floor is about 1 200 square feet and the cellar is another 900
7154447 theres a loft above the winery where we hold our events theres a large deck off of that weve already had three weddings there and a couple of parties we also have a harvest festival every fall
7154448 i was really horrible at chemistry in high school and in my first class at grayson he was talking about things i hadnt heard of in 30 years i was going to drop the course but he told me to hang in there i did and he sort of took me under his wing that really impressed me he asked me to help him with his winemaking at the homestead winery and i did a little bit of an apprenticeship there
7154449 my philosophy is just to make a good product and treat people right and theyll find you you need to make multiple use of your space with parties and weddings and other vents because youre not going to make a lot of money on the wine
7154450 if i were to give someone advice on how to open a winery id certainly suggest they start with a million dollars its going to take more money and more time than you expect
7154451 you have lost so much weight youre dying of cancer arent you
7154452 our wine is a true expression of our location being on lake travis we chose norton grapes because theyre at least tolerant of pierces disease plus we wanted to do something a bit different
7154453 we make a red wine called claros and a port
7154454 id describe claros as being close to a pinot noir it has that sort of softness to it id actually like it to be a little more full bodied but thats going to vary from year to year
7154455 theres obviously nothing i can do about it you just have to go with the flow you get these violent spring storms with golf ball sized hail that snaps everything off thats happened to us twice now or you get the situation we had last year where you get 24 inches of rain in six weeks and everything rots
7154456 we make a red wine called claros and a port
7154457 id describe claros as being close to a pinot noir it has that sort of softness to it id actually like it to be a little more full bodied but thats going to vary from year to year
7154458 theres obviously nothing i can do about it you just have to go with the flow you get these violent spring storms with golf ball sized hail that snaps everything off thats happened to us twice now or you get the situation we had last year where you get 24 inches of rain in six weeks and everything rots
7154459 part of the idea came from the romance of having a winery and my background ive always been very much into plants and that sort of thing it just became a rather natural progression once we had the land that it evolved into a winery
7154460 i would have to say it was more circumstances than anything else you know how things just evolve in life opening a winery wasnt something we set out to do in life it was something that just evolved
7154461 the people here are terribly friendly just like back home and a lot of the terrain is the same and the hot summers the weather is also different the barossa has a true mediterranean climate meaning it rains in the winter and has dry summers here its just completely unpredictable
7154462 its very rewarding theres something wonderful about planting a vineyard and then three years later picking the grapes and then two years after that drinking the wine theres a real sense of accomplishment to that the whole thing is a way of life its all encompassing and most enjoyable
7154463 i was buying maybe 1 5 million in wine at the wholesale level in 1978
7154464 back then that was quite a lot so i was fortunate enough to be involved in the wine industry in california when it was just getting off the ground back then nobody knew who those guys were today theyre rockstars but back then i was going into their wineries and spending the afternoon sitting on five gallon buckets turned upside down and learning everything they knew about winemaking i was also learning how much they didnt know it was an inspiration
7154465 i was thinking maybe we could do sherry or port or something like that in texas
7154466 they made three types of wine red white and ros and it was about 1 75 for a five liter screw cap jug it was widely regarded as just a monumental joke by the people of santa barbara they looked on it with absolute disdain
7154467 its hard to imagine today that the california wine industry was ever that primitive but 35 years ago it was
7154468 the first stage of the california wine industry was the development of the three colors
7154469 thats where most texas wineries are today wineries all over the state are making 15 20 wines and then they make one reserve and thats where they hang their hats
7154470 that was the beginning of the explosion of the california wine industry
7154471 when they got far enough that they had boutique wineries that didnt have to make trash varietals to survive
7154472 were at the very leading edge of trying to find out if texas can and will be willing to support a winery that will not make cash flow wine
7154473 ive seen so many wineries get started in texas and the first thing they do is pick up the phone and call california and ask how do i make this wine
7154474 europeans look at their winemaking so differently than the californians and there are really good scientific reasons they do california wine is basically high glycerin low mineral chemistry european wine is high mineral low glycerin chemistry so the two are diametric opposites when you talk to the french their opinion of climate is oh its somewhat important but its not like when youre talking to californians and theyre talking about specific microclimates they leave the listener with the impression that climate is some sort of super precise factor in their winemaking when in reality climate is sort of a window
7154475 you can look at the roads cut into the hills in south texas and on either side theres just solid white limestone all over the place
7154476 all of texas is just infused with calcium to an extent that no one had ever really thought possible and it radically affects all of our winemaking it also radically affects winemaking in europe vs california the presence of calcium in bordeaux is specifically the reason why cabernet sauvignon cannot be made as a varietal because cabernet is a mineral sponge unblended cabernet in bordeaux when youre barrel tasting tastes absolutely like sheetrock
7154477 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7154478 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7154479 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7154480 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7154481 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7154482 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7154483 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7154484 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7154485 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7154486 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7154487 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7154488 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7154489 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7154490 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7154491 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7154492 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7154493 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7154494 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7154495 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7154496 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7154497 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7154498 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7154499 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7154500 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7154501 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7154502 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7154503 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7154504 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7154505 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7154506 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7154507 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7154508 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7154509 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7154510 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7154511 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7154512 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7154513 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7154514 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7154515 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7154516 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7154517 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7154518 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7154519 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7154527 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7154528 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7154529 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7154530 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7154573 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7154574 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7154575 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7154576 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7154577 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7154578 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7154579 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7154580 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7154581 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7154582 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7154583 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7154584 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7154585 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7154586 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7154587 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7154588 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7154589 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7154590 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7154591 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7154592 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7154593 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7154594 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7154595 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7154596 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7154597 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7154598 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7154599 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7154600 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7154601 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7154602 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do

7154641 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7154642 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again

7154650 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics
7154651 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7154652 they will never be in charge of the nations affairs
7154653 they can say and do anything and not be accountable for it whereas the opposition has a responsibility to the wider community because they could conceivably be the government
7154654 the only reason that the minor parties votes even matter is because dr nelson and the liberal party are trying to take an axe to the budget
7154655 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election

7154662 implies that operator error was responsible for the mammoth hydraulic pump failures
7154663 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and catastrophic failures of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job
7154664 i strongly agree that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes

7154692 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many
7154693 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7154694 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7154695 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7154696 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7154725 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
7154726 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
7154727 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
7154728 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
7154729 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video

7154731 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7154732 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7154733 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7154734 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7154735 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7154768 reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7154769 e ion that i pondered for a long time was
7154770 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7154771 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7154772 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7154773 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7154774 we may not agree on this but were all democrats and we want this to come to a good conclusion

7154784 ive never been in this position before i know what the girls are capable of and theyve only showed it in a couple of games
7154785 weve got to look very closely at our competition back home and say that if these are the best players and im confident they were then our competition back home is nowhere near strong enough
7154786 weve got to look at our competition our national hockey league as it is soft i think our club scene is far too soft its accommodating to mediocre players
7154787 weve got secondary school players in a premier competition in christchurch and if the new zealand hockey public believe thats going to put us in the top bracket of the world theyve got it wrong
7154788 my hope is that the people who are in control of the purse strings recognise the ability of this group and the progress that this group has made
7154789 its one of those things when you dont get the results that you want youve got to put in even more to keep up with those top nations you need money
7154790 its so different than when youre the rabbit tonight i chased i knew what i wanted to do for my team

7154804 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7154805 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7154806 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7154807 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7154808 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7154809 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7154810 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7154811 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7154812 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here

7154821 in the last three or four years i have seen her maybe three or four times for lunch some of those times have been with brett i get on quite well with brett
7154822 i have been going through some troubles of my own and liz is a friend of mine that i could tell stuff like that
7154823 brett flew liz and her mother around the world so he could have them near him
7154824 all he ever spoke about was seeing his family so i am sure that cricket wasnt the reason for the break up liz certainly seemed to enjoy the lifestyle

7154829 this posture automatically carries with it the possibility of a russian nuclear attack by mistake

7154835 t he percent of income we spend on transportation has been remarkably constant over time even though the distance we travel per capita has nearly tripled
7154836 no matter how you slice the available data it tells more or less the same story the cost of driving is reasonably affordable today relative to what it has been in the past
7154837 we have never been a band to write the same record twice and we have never enjoyed records that are 1 single and 11 worse versions of the same song this record is the most diverse thing we have done to date every song is different and brings something new to the overall experience of the cd when you look back to all the classic records of our time they are full of all kinds of different songs vulgar display of power just wouldnt be the same without this love and hollow our record is a breath of fresh air in a scene that is turning stale

7154850 when it first appeared some critics dismissed manufacturing consent as just so much conspiracy theory
7154851 the united states has been arming and training georgias armed forces throughout the bush years under the guise of fighting terrorism but its fair to say that a stronger motive may be the fact that the critical baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline an outlet for oil from azerbaijan and kazakhstan that bypasses russian territory runs smack through georgian territory
7154852 notwithstanding two decades of critique and refinement recent events underscore the continued relevance of the propaganda model for understanding how and why u s news media operate as they do
7154853 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
7154854 i think clearly the problem is coming from moscow and i think if the u s is going to be effective we have to let the russians know directly that we think this is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century
7154855 i really feel like weve been pressured into this and i resent it
7154856 over the past couple of years i feel that when i have encountered things in the newspaper from randy paul they have seemed to be things i have cared about

7154878 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7154879 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of united states of america joe biden
7154880 obamas choice of joe biden clearly demonstrates that obama recognizes his vast lack of experience and weakness on foreign policy even biden recognized that barack obama was ill prepared to be our commander in chief in his own quest for the democrat presidential nomination biden declared that the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training and i couldnt agree more the selection of biden doesnt negate obamas flaws it highlights them
7154881 what that says about our conference is that each team takes a lot of pride in their defense
7154882 theres going to be no easy weeks from here on out we have to be ready to play every week
7154883 the directors vision was muddled and the plot left much to be desired
7154884 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7154885 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7154886 john mccain and the press knows this is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years
7154887 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7154888 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7154889 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7154890 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7154891 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7154892 world aint what it seems is it gunny you keep that in mind the moment you think you got it figured youre wrong
7154893 biden is also a long time member and current chairman of the u
7154894 in november 2006 biden and leslie gelb president emeritus of the council on foreign relations released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in iraq

7154906 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7154907 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7154908 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7154909 monday and tuesday next week we will be holding dialogues with local officials bishops and ulamas and different people in the areas affected so that we can take a closer look at the situation and try to see what is the best way of restoring normalcy to the life of everyone there

7154927 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it

7154941 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7154942 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7154943 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them

7154999 but the one time i tried it when i was in college it hurt so badly that i dont think i can ever try it again
7155000 im afraid that im not capable of doing it and i want to so badly
7155001 what form of lubrication did you use when you tried it in college
7155002 yes the anal canal doesnt have any natural lubrication so there must be some artificial lubricant used to prevent chafing and pain
7155003 ky jelly is the most widely used of sexual lubricants but most any water soluble lube will do
7155004 well there are few nerve endings in the anal passage some women can achieve release from anal penetration but most do not therefore additional stimulation is required to make the act pleasurable for the woman and manual stimulation of the clitoris by one or more of the partners is usually required since it is normally easier for the woman to apply the necessary stimulation and she is generally more attuned to her own needs it is usually left to the woman to pleasure herself during anal sex
7155005 and did your college partner properly relax your sphincter before penetration
7155006 well the method i suggest is to insert a small lubricated penetrant into the sphincter and get it to relax and expand to that size then introduce a larger one let the sphincter relax and expand to accept that size and gradually increase the size of the penetrant until the anus is spread to where the penis can be inserted without causing any significant additional stretching of the muscle the sphincter is capable of expanding to accept most any size cock that youll find on a human but it is a very strong muscle and has to be relaxed and gently enlarged to accommodate whatever youre looking to insert in there
7155007 and was the rest of your body properly relaxed before the anal penetration
7155008 well i dont want to get too personal but how many orgasms did your partner give you before the attempted anal penetration
7155009 why he didnt even give me one the whole time
7155010 well i recommend that any woman who is interested is allowing her partner to perform anal sex with her demand at least two non anal orgasms prior to the anal penetration this will relax the rest of her body and the subsequent relaxation and penetration of the anus will be much easier and more enjoyable
7155011 two orgasms i dont know if i can have two orgasms im happy to have just one
7155012 oh well have you ever tried to have multiple orgasms
7155013 well no i havent tried im usually just trying for one and if i do manage to achieve one hes usually done and asleep
7155014 so youve never required him to get you off before he starts himself
7155015 would you tell my boyfriend all this stuff if i brought him in to the office
7155016 well it is possible that youre either not capable of multiple orgasms or possibly incapable of relaxing the sphincter to properly accept your boyfriends member if that is the case then any talking i did with your boyfriend would be useless and would just frustrate the both of you even more what i suggest is that you let me examine you and as long as we dont find any medical problems that would prevent you from performing anal sex i can demonstrate the techniques that are known to work and then you could actually show your boyfriend how to do it in the proper manner
7155017 well do you have any plans for tomorrow say around 10 30 am we could meet here at the office
7155018 that would be great doc thank you so much for helping me out with this you are such a doll would you like me to bring some doughnuts
7155019 my what a beautiful day it turned out to be
7155020 the sky is crystal clear and not a cloud to be seen
7155021 ok a couple of preliminary questions if you dont mind
7155022 well then it looks like you can withstand an anal penetration
7155023 so your bowels are evacuated and you couldnt move any more no matter how hard you tried
7155024 good because it is easier to relax the sphincter if you pretend that you are trying to move your bowels and as long as youre confident that there is nothing to evacuate you will be able to press down and relax without having to worry about actually expelling anything
7155025 and you and your partner should be aware that passing gas is not unusual in these situations
7155026 yes you may have to fart before penetration during the act itself and quite often immediately after the penetrant is removed it is a natural function of the anal tract to expel excess gasses from the digestive system
7155027 ill have to remember to tell jeremy about that could i take some tums before we try it
7155028 you could but as long as you both realize that it is a normal bodily function you should just be able to ignore it when it happens i should hope that you and your partner would be too interested in pleasuring each other to let something like that distract you
7155029 oh havent i told you about him jeremy thurston is his name hes doing his residency at the hospital
7155030 well i hope the two of you can find true happiness together
7155031 last night in the bath after jeremy and i talked on the phone
7155032 oh goodness no the one that i did have absolutely wiped me out
7155033 hmmm well that might still be a problem but i doubt that it is insurmountable
7155034 when you masturbate do you use any sex toys a vibrator dildo or anything of the like
7155035 oh it was fantastic i had a tremendous orgasm just wonderful
7155036 thats good you might want to consider getting yourself some sex aids you can buy them over the internet these days without having to let anyone else know and without having to go into that grubby adult store downtown just be sure to clean them thoroughly with alcohol after each use and be sure to get a good supply of lube
7155037 then you could get yourself properly excited before intercourse to ensure your orgasm or if you can train yourself to be multi orgasmic then you could get yourself off once or twice before the two of you get started together many men are sexually aroused by watching their partner masturbate
7155038 what do you mean train myself to be multi orgasmic is it something that i can learn to do
7155039 well you admitted that youve never even tried to have more than one lets try it today and see if youre capable and sex is like anything else the more you practice the better at it you get why dont you step into exam room 2 take your clothes off and sit up on the examination table ill be there in a minute or two
7155040 the rnc and the dnc thats one of their things that they do
7155041 they converge hundreds of people into these cities and they like to leave something nice behind thats why the conventions are involved
7155042 they saw us and they said what a perfect way to give back
7155043 we had to seek out some vets to say we have this wonderful opportunity
7155044 theres not much democrats and republicans agree on but we all agree on supporting our troops
7155045 thats why the democratic and republican national conventions are proud to join homes for our troops in building specially adapted new homes in denver and minneapolis st paul for a seriously wounded servicemember and their family from each of these communities
7155046 sen biden has consistently expressed support for a womans right to choose while we have not agreed with him on every vote we have a longstanding relationship with sen biden that is open positive and constructive and we are confident this will continue in a new administration under sen obamas pro choice leadership
7155047 every environment is different the resources are different what you can use and what the people will accept is even different
7155048 even if you discover something that has already been done you have to figure out how to get it accepted here you have to be able to work with people on a human level those were our challenges in the beginning we realized early that half of our job was going to be to sell the solution
7155049 when i was at physician assistant school i never even considered that i would do anything like this
7155050 the reality of it is when you get out into your job you have to look around in the environment to find out what the problems are and decide how you re going to fix them
7155051 when we got here all we could see is what we could not do
7155052 we had to learn and accept what we could do and do it to the best of our ability once we got to that phase we took off like a runaway train it almost got simpler when we took a step back you cant solve all of these childrens individual medical problems but you can tackle very simple things that is going to impact a lot of people
7155053 once we convinced them to taste it they realized it was a good thing and they all gave their verbal pledge which is a big deal
7155054 they all stood up and agreed that their village and their families would use it
7155055 everything that we are doing goes back to clean their water
7155056 we are really trying to get to the lowest common denominator with everything
7155057 we are using this particular recipe because there is no cooking required
7155058 the types of ingredients we are using are not water based so this can stand on a shelf without refrigeration for four months this really works perfectly it wont go bad it wont cause disease and it wont cause sickness
7155059 we can teach them to make this the materials are here in the country and they can sustain this they just need to know how to do it and know that it exists
7155060 the children dont have to actually chew it they can suck on it they dont have to have a lot of strength or teeth
7155061 they are educated they see what we are doing for them and they are very appreciative one of the reasons they are so happy about this is they see us doing something and they know they can do it too
7155062 it is not just something we will implement while we are here and then we leave it is gone they are going to take this and they are going to run with it they want their kids to survive and now they are getting the tools to do it and realizing they can do it themselves
7155063 it is not unrealistic to cut the child birth mortality rate in half in an area with the implementation of this course
7155064 we are ready to see these programs moved on to a larger scale
7155065 the taliban works to say we are infidels i think the people we affect with our work see that we are trying to learn their ways and see that we are trying to adapt to their way we are trying to find ways to help them while respecting their culture an acceptance based on this will allow us to take big steps forward in working ourselves out of a job
7155066 the 132 kv substation in east diwaniyah is very important for the electrical grid in this region this new substation will reduce the load currently on two 33 11 kv substations built in 2003 to a reasonable level
7155067 the substations built in 2003 are part of the master plan developed by the iraqi ministry of electricity but were not built to handle the current demand for power
7155068 more substations are being built throughout the qadisiyah province and when finished will link together forming a stabilized grid
7155069 with the help of iraqi engineers like dukman working with contractor pauwels international who has employed hundreds of local iraqis this 25 million project is nearly complete

7155074 we consider this one of our most successful olympic games ever u
7155075 the team will surpass the total medal count in athens 102 but that doesnt tell the whole story
7155076 this team has represented the nation in exemplary fashion and brought honor to the united states
7155077 whats good for us as a country is overall participation
7155078 were fascinated like any country with gold medals but whats more important is for team sports to do well because thats what gets kids out of chairs and playing
7155079 our womens soccer team played very well they won gold but more important in a way for our country their actions will bring thousands more kids in to play that sport thats good for the health of the country
7155080 oh dont worry about that the distributor will pay for it
7155081 oh dont worry mr student teacher why dont you let mumof4 explain it all she is very experienced
7155082 all of a sudden everyone was like theres boys that are stuck up there does anyone have a cell phone and everyone just started panicking and screaming
7155083 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7155084 its just something to let the people know that shes not forgotten
7155085 this loss has taken a big toll on family and friends and its a big day for everyone
7155086 not just a friend but i really really loved her
7155087 what im so upset about now is that nothing has been done
7155088 i was promised the case would not go cold i was told by the detectives things would be fine and we would take care of it right away and theres a camera here at the murder scene as well and still nothings been done about it and i am freaking livid right now i am so upset
7155089 i want the rochester police department the mayor the chief of police i want them to know that not only my sister but everyone in rochester whos murder has not been solved i think they need to work a little harder to give the families some closure

7155103 i want to make it very clear that throughout my more than 36 year career as a firefighter i have never imperiled the general safety of newton firefighters or the general public by using or possessing illegal drugs
7155104 our understanding now from employees is that there was a problem with one of the machines overheating or sparking which caught some material on fire they did try to put it out initially but were forced to leave the building
7155105 id say the fire probably would be not necessarily suspicious any more but well leave it under investigation tonight
7155106 neighbors were all making sure everybody was out and ok
7155107 adding joe biden to the ticket just solidifies our support for senator obama senator biden has always been a friend of fire fighters just like senator obama
7155108 in addition to the structure fire there were also two trash fires around the same time in the neighborhood
7155109 i looked out the window and my god the whole house was aflame
7155110 the whole front of the house was engulfed its a very nice neighborhood a very quiet street you never expect it to happen here

7155140 im convinced this new crossover vehicles styling creature comforts and luxury will transform the market
7155141 early consumers designers and retailers ive spoken with share my view so i thought a bold groundbreaking vehicle should have an equally bold and groundbreaking network on the web where flex fans can congregate talk about the flex and discuss new innovations for this reason i created flexfans org as the virtual flex community and meeting place
7155142 while ive been participating as a resource in other online forums and sites focused on the flex demetra has introduced the first true social network for flex enthusiasts complete with photos video profiles blogs public and private groups and ask the expert wikis its the best social network available to those of us with something to express about the flex or those who want to watch and learn more
7155143 we were so excited about carsdivas new flex site we invited the carsdiva to our flex introduction party in philadelphia and she agreed to attend
7155144 i love a party i love the new flex and car folks are my favorite people i was thrilled to accept when several dealers invited me to attend consumer event launch parties for the flex
7155145 were enthusiastic to introduce the flex and wanted to throw a fantastic party around the vehicle launch friday im certain carsdivas presence will enhance the occasion

7155150 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
7155151 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
7155152 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
7155153 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
7155154 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
7155155 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle dbrickashaw ferguson was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
7155156 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
7155157 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pregame talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
7155158 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
7155159 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practice and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow

7155178 ive been out of the hospital for about three weeks now
7155179 there are a couple things that kind of give you that impression one is a biopsy which is just them taking a piece of your bone marrow out of your back and just seeing whats being produced at your bone marrow
7155180 brothers stem cells are producing new blood cells now in my body and its just going to take a while for me to build my immunity up so its been nothing but goodness since we got out and im just happy to be out of the hospital
7155181 i feel good you just take a nap during the day they said thats pretty normal especially with the medication that you take but other than that ive got to wear a mask when i leave the house
7155182 yeah i mean ive got my strength i cant just jump back into a workout just yet because i have to wear masks for three months out of the hospital so its almost been a month and thats to prevent like a fungus that you can get if you dont wear a mask when you go outside
7155183 oh yeah im very sure that everything is going to work out just fine
7155184 i appreciate that i didnt even realize it until just out of nowhere weve been receiving a lot of support from everybody and everywhere
7155185 frerottes got a great wealth of knowledge and he can still spin it for a guy his age
7155186 i mean hes really got great arm strength and great command of the ball i think his accuracy and his experience and his arm strength theyre all real positive about it obviously he brings a wealth of knowledge to the game
7155187 i thought it was a great get for us and i think hes made us better
7155188 hes got a different skill set in terms of his mobility and things like that but certainly hes capable of doing anything that we do he can negotiate all the throws he can get it down the field he can chuck it down he can do all the things that were required to do in this offense
7155189 a very unique arm for being his age being 15 years in the league to be able to spin it like he can
7155190 hes still got great velocity and can negotiate the ball well over 60 yards down the field
7155191 hes a positive in terms of leadership with the other guys too hes also a coach on the field for me he helps t jack find out where the bones are buried on certain plays hes a great help
7155192 because the rules are different i dont think it hurts you
7155193 so from our standpoint we would like to see our guards play in space as opposed to seeing them covered and our center covered so i dont think its a downside when you get kind of mix and match a little bit
7155194 from my personal experieces with games its pretty helpful when ur on a mount and youre allowed to fire a bow or gun or whatever i think this would make a pretty good addition to wow and for those of you who think this would introduce an unfair advantage to the game the attacks should have a far lesser chance of hitting the target personally i think this would be insanely helpful in pvp and like hunters there should be certain shots that have effects like stun and all that even if its only for one class i think the benefits would be great
7155195 alright so i was in nagrand today and i was picking up some food in garadar and thrall was there sitting next to greatmother geyah and noticed his armor was well lets just say he looks like he should be a level 40 im just suggesting to change the armor of thrall and make him look like the badass that he is

7155225 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
7155226 while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago

7155249 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7155250 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything

7155264 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7155265 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7155266 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership

7155279 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of united states of america joe biden
7155280 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7155281 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now

7155294 mommy why is that gun pointing at us whose gun is that
7155295 are you sure you wont use this as a sort of argument weapon against me in future
7155296 no lar i am just curious its normal for a girlfriend to find out about all the deep dirty secrets of her bfs past before she marries him
7155297 uh nope its not normal at all none of my exes ever asked about my exes
7155298 thats because you are not marrying them but you are marrying me come on i am just curious okay its what i do i always ask kaypoh questions to everyone okay
7155299 okay okay so we had sex it was only once or twice okay no big deal then she moved away and we broke up
7155300 who i dont remember having a boyfriend with that name
7155301 hmmm he does look familiar oh i remember now hes the one from st xaviers right
7155302 but hes not my ex we were not a couple or anything we just went out a few times thats all
7155303 yeah we went out for drinks and dinner a few times but there was nothing serious going on

7155308 my brother who paid rs 700 000 to a boatman to take his family to mannar was arrested by the ltte three months ago and is in jail in kilinochchi now those who are caught by the ltte have to serve seven year imprisonment
7155309 the ltte cannot survive longer there people do not support them because of their rigid rules they are sick of the ltte cadres who are harassing people
7155310 fighting for the ltte is compulsory for those who are 18 and below 45 years they have ordered all state and private sector workers in wanni to join the combat training
7155311 our people want to live a peaceful life and their only hope is to give a good education to their children but as tigers abduct school children most of the parents do not send their children to schools they keep them hiding now they wonder how long they are going to hide their children
7155312 earlier joining the ltte and the weapon training was not compulsory but now the villagers cannot refuse the order as the ltte will either kidnap us or will cut down the ration no option is left for the entrapped civilians the food and all other stuff sent by the government are controlled by the ltte though the distribution is carried out by the ga
7155313 we do not know the food allocation for the refugees and we cannot question the ltte the truth is that the innocent civilians who do not want their families die in hunger accept the challenge of becoming ltte cadres
7155314 earlier the ltte commanded a great respect and people helped them even by giving over their children to the movement but now people want freedom and they hate the ltte
7155315 people listen to the epdp radio channel but if they are caught the ltte will fine them rs 3 000 and will smash the radio
7155316 now instead of handing over the bodies to the families the ltte itself will perform the rituals and send a note saying that these cadres were cremated honourably
7155317 while they were crying and screaming the terrorist cadres took them away and we never saw them again
7155318 i cannot believe my eyes they did not know that we were coming when my parents inform the soldiers that we were coming for days without food they gave us their meals

7155328 afghanistan takes every necessary measure to avoid and stop such tragic accidents happening in the future
7155329 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7155330 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7155331 it provides propaganda to the taliban and if they dont take responsibility it actually helps the taliban
7155332 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

7155345 greece is not a rich country and we had problems with things like health system and education system people ask whether it was worth it
7155346 they hadnt planned for the venues to be given for sport to the public to the youth and to the local sporting clubs
7155347 what seemed more important was their financial and commercial use
7155348 the cost was very big and the result was not what it should have been
7155349 perhaps what they do mind is that after the olympics we did not use the olympics as a springboard for the country
7155350 was it worth it could we have done more to exploit the olympics afterwards the answer is absolutely yes
7155351 we could have done more in terms of using the facilities more and using the feeling that it created in the country

7155356 in febbraio il vicepresidente iracheno hashemi london middle east institute il suo intervento ha provocato forte reazioni riassumibili in due posizioni la prima stata una reazione fortemente negativa riportata nella nostra rivista di marzo scritta da uno sciita iracheno che ha espresso una manifesta sfiducia in quel che hashemi ha dichiarato in quanto a suo avviso il vicepresidente iracheno stava assumendo una posizione integralmente sunnita cercando di condonare e di trascurare in un certo senso i crimini del regime di saddam lintervento di questo scrittore iracheno riflette la situazione attuale del mondo politico iracheno in cui si sono accentuate le divisioni tra sunniti sciiti e curdi tariq hashemi ha parlato in modo chiaro e persuasivo aldil delle opinioni che si possono avere su di lui ma le forti reazioni che ha provocato in alcuni segmenti del pubblico riflettono i problemi pi vasti presenti allinterno delliraq laltra reazione al discorso del vicepresidente hashemi riportata sul giornale molto molto pi favorevole nel senso che ha colto la posizione accomodante assunta da hashemi ovvero un desiderio di parlare agli altri sunniti per coinvolgerli nel processo politico per forgiare un governo che rifletta di meno gli interessi settari in breve questo commentatore ha visto nelle parole di hashemi uno sforzo di accomodamento moderazione e pluralismo quindi abbiamo un riassunto della situazione politica irachena con una profonda sfiducia che attraversa le linee settarie qualunque cosa si dica in termini di accordo di pluralismo di collaborazione con laltra parte si ottiene sfiducia totale da gran parte di coloro che non appartengono allo stesso fronte questo stato danimo riflesso in questa discussione e abbiamo ritenuto utile evidenziarlo nella rivista per indicare queste profonde differenze

7155358 the major towns of the agency like khar raghagan hajilawant jar and others were completely deserted no sign of life was seen there some of the houses and a religious seminary near jar village had been dashed to the ground after being hit by missiles fired from gunship helicopters or jet fighters that were used in the operation

7155360 around 30 people were killed in our village during the operation which forced us to leave the town

7155382 another critical point that needs to be highlighted is that lyme ignorant physicians often administer medication that is contraindicated in patients with lyme disease the therapy most often prescribed that is extremely contraindicated is the use of steroidal anti inflammatories usually the glucocorticosteroids such as prednisone lyme patients suffer with many painful inflammatory symptoms mds not knowing that the patient has lyme disease think it is appropriate to treat these patients with steroids to reduce the pain and inflammation unfortunately steroidal therapy is very deleterious to lyme patients because it suppresses the patients immune system causing it to tolerate the presence of borrelia instead of attacking and killing it this harmful treatment significantly diminishes the prognosis of lyme patients it prolongs the course of the disease and makes it more severe in the long run

7155427 the long time head of the nflpa has been beaten up and vilified for a leadership style that was highly effective in the 1990s and new millennium but not stereotypically militant enough to please the media critics who hypocritically blast al sharpton and label any black man who chooses a different path a sellout

7155539 it is no secret that agriprocessors was forced to cut back production of meat and poultry after more than a third of its labor force was seized in a may 12th raid by immigration and customs enforcement
7155540 while the company has made big strides in hiring new workers and restoring production it is still significantly behind may 12th levels

7155543 one way or the other we are determined to deny iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them that is our bottom line
7155544 together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them saddam hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nations wealth not on providing for the iraqi people but on developing nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
7155545 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
7155546 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
7155547 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
7155548 as a member of the house intelligence committee i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
7155549 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
7155550 this december will mark three years since united nations inspectors last visited iraq there is no doubt that since that time saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
7155551 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
7155552 we know that he has stored away secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
7155553 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
7155554 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
7155555 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
7155556 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction im a co sponsor of the bipartisan resolution thats presently under consideration in the senate saddam husseins regime is a grave threat to america and our allies
7155557 i will be voting to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
7155558 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction
7155559 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do
7155560 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
7155561 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
7155562 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real
7155563 we need to help these countries develop sophisticated air defence and anti tank capabilities that dont pose any offensive threat to russia but promise the possibility of very high casualties were they to attempt what they did in georgia
7155564 nato has to make a fundamental decision here about its legal and ethical obligations and the only way we can really fulfil them is to help these countries defend themselves in advance of an attack
7155565 some of them are saying they are so upset that theyll never stay at a hilton again and some of them say theyll never come back to las vegas again

7155576 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7155577 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7155578 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7155579 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly

7155632 we will know less and less what is a human being
7155633 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7155634 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7155635 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7155636 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7155637 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7155638 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7155639 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7155640 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7155641 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7155642 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7155643 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7155644 if you trust every web site but not a government
7155645 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7155646 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7155647 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7155648 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes

7155673 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
7155674 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
7155675 i still would have probably made a slightly different choice than clinton did
7155676 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
7155677 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
7155678 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
7155679 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth

7155682 this could be one of the biggest pieces of corporate welfare ever
7155683 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
7155684 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
7155685 weve probably done a better job of the last 20 years on the problems the market can solve than the problems the market cant solve were doing pretty well on the size of peoples houses and televisions and the like were not looking so good on infrastructure and education
7155686 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
7155687 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
7155688 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
7155689 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7155690 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7155691 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
7155692 we all talk about apollo 11 but there were some pretty public pretty awful failures along the way

7155721 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

7155728 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7155729 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7155730 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7155731 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7155732 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7155733 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7155734 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7155735 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7155736 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7155737 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7155738 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7155739 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7155740 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7155741 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7155742 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7155743 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7155744 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7155745 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7155746 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7155747 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7155748 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7155749 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7155750 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7155752 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7155753 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7155754 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7155755 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7155756 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7155757 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7155758 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7155759 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7155760 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7155764 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7155765 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7155766 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7155767 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7155768 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7155769 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7155770 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7155778 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7155779 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7155780 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7155781 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho

7155786 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7155787 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7155788 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7155789 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7155790 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7155791 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7155792 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7155793 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7155794 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7155795 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7155796 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7155797 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7155800 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7155801 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7155802 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7155803 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7155804 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7155805 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7155806 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7155807 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7155808 tenemos que alcanzar un acuerdo de manera r pida para no perder una inversi n superior a los 1 2 millones de euros
7155809 estamos vertiendo aguas residuales sin tratar a las zonas de ba o y ya contamos con requerimientos de medio ambiente para encontrar una soluci n
7155810 hay que tener en cuenta su viabilidad y si se incrementan los costes del proyecto adem s de que hay que contar con informes preceptivos de otras administraciones
7155811 prioritaria y no va a perjudicar a los vecinos porque lo que se propone es instalar una tecnolog a sofisticada conforme a la normativa europea y por tanto con m s garant as de que no habr olores
7155812 en las eras hay ya una depuradora funcionando y no hay problemas de malos olores
7155813 es una necesidad inmediata que hemos negociado durante 4 a os porque los emisarios de los que disponemos en el n cleo est n rotos y vertiendo en las zonas de ba o algo por lo que ya hemos recibido advertencias de la consejer a de medio ambiente
7155814 hasta hace unos d as no ha habido ning n incremento en el n mero de m dicos forenses en santa cruz en los ltimos 26 a os frente al aumento de la criminalidad de haber pasado de nueve juzgados entonces a los treinta y tres en la actualidad y sobre todo la importancia que ha adquirido la figura del m dico forense en los ltimos tiempos porque antes era excepcional que intervini ramos en pleitos civiles no exist amos para los temas de menores de los entonces tribunales tutelares ni en asuntos laborales de la magistratura de trabajo y ahora s que somos requeridos a pesar de que como ya dije hemos venido contando hasta hace unos d as con el mismo n mero de plazas
7155815 nos permitir abrir la quinta verde como un parque y compartir las instalaciones con el cabildo
7155816 un sitio donde trabajo con las obras y los marcos artesanales pero donde al mismo tiempo exponen artistas y se intercambian ideas
7155817 quiero que la gente este c moda eso lo aplico a los clientes a los artistas y a mi misma
7155818 poco a poco saldr n de momento me interesa dar cabida a los artistas isle os
7155819 he aprendido desde lo b sico entr por casualidad a trabajar en una tienda y descubr que me encantaba estar entre molduras es muy bonito coger una obra y encontrar cual es el marco perfecto para ella
7155820 trabajo con una serie de modelos pero los personalizo es un reto cont nuo y hay que ir conociendo cada secreto
7155821 hoy en d a es dif cil encontrar quien ense e estas t cnicas de doraci n es todo un arte
7155822 la decisi n tiene que ser equilibrada yo aconsejo pero el cliente es el que tiene la ltima palabra intento preguntar cual es la decoraci n de su casa para poder orientar un poco
7155823 he trabajado con obras muy importantes por aqu han pasado cuadros de scar dom nguez o de juan ismael esto me da un poco de v rtigo es una responsabilidad
7155824 estoy muy contenta con lo que hemos hecho y lo que nos queda por hacer
7155825 soy muy visual la obra me tiene que gustar a la primera valoro mucho que los artistas innoven e investiguen
7155826 uno de los rincones de espa a que siempre llevo en mi coraz n porque en esta tierra me siento como en mi casa

7155828 quiero decirles algo que muchos no saben y es que hace muchos a os cuando yo era un chaval ven a mucho a veranear a tenerife me encanta esta isla los tinerfe os y los canarios
7155829 cuando sopla un poco de viento parece que una est en mitad del desierto a m lo que me preocupa es para qu han puesto aqu eso si es que hasta cuando quieres ver el suculum tienes que estar girando la cabeza a m que me expliquen para que sirve eso
7155830 parec a que el edificio iba a volar en peso
7155831 al principio daba miedo porque lo ibas oyendo poco a poco y no sab as muy bien lo que era
7155832 parece como si ah debajo hubiera todo el d a un temporal del polo norte no vemos la hora de que finalmente se caiga porque esto es insoportable
7155833 estamos pensando en ir al m dico porque hay veces que a uno le da hasta miedo
7155834 eso est hecho con tela de ce ir de las m quinas eso no tiene ning n valor
7155835 si se pod a haber hecho m s r pido
7155836 si est dentro de un tiempo l gico o si adem s hubo alg n fallo de coordinaci n
7155837 hay unos procedimientos y unos protocolos que se deben seguir a rajatabla

7155900 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7155901 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7155902 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7155903 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7155904 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7155905 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7155906 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7155907 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7155908 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7155909 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7155910 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7155911 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7155912 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7155913 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7155914 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7155915 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7155916 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7155917 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7155918 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7155919 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7155920 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7155921 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7155922 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7155923 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7155924 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7155925 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7155926 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7155927 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7155928 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7155929 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7155930 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7155931 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7155932 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7155933 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7155934 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7155935 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7155936 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7155937 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7155938 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7155939 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7155940 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7155941 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7155942 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7155943 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7155944 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7155945 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7155946 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7155947 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7155948 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7155949 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7155950 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7155951 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7155952 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7155953 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7155954 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7155955 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7155956 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7155957 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7155958 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7155959 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7155960 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7155961 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7155962 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7155963 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7155964 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7155965 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7155966 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7155967 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7155968 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7155969 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7155970 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7155971 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7155972 senator obama sees community health centers as a vital part of efforts to invest in prevention and reduce costs
7155973 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining
7155974 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7155975 was running a campaign to cut coverage for the poor
7155976 in the past we opened our doors and saw whoever came
7155977 we would see a patient who had general pneumonia and if we needed to see a patient who needed a liver transplant that liver transplant patient couldnt get in the door
7155978 we were taking general patients away from mercy hospital michael reese and they were financially at risk
7155979 we harmed other hospitals without knowing we harmed other hospitals
7155980 the collapse of the health care system was driving more and more people to the emergency room
7155981 the trend line was and is a disastrous one from the standpoint of maintaining the hospital their goal was to find an answer
7155982 some participants view the word urban as code for black
7155983 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7155984 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7155985 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7155986 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7155987 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7155988 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7155989 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7155990 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7155991 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7155992 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7155993 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7155994 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7155995 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7155996 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7155997 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7155998 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7155999 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7156000 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7156001 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7156002 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7156003 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7156004 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7156005 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7156006 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7156007 to prosecute individuals who intentionally allow mass copying from their computer over peer to peer networks
7156008 update and reform our copyright and patent systems to promote civic discourse innovation and investment while ensuring that intellectual property owners are fairly treated
7156009 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
7156010 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7156011 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime
7156012 authorize the justice department to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations
7156013 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7156014 the democratic partys de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism
7156015 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7156016 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7156017 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7156018 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7156019 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7156020 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7156021 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7156022 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7156023 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7156024 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7156025 video that lists the necessary ingredients and shows some self described rednecks blowing up small plastic bottles in their yard
7156026 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations
7156027 crimes dangerous to the life limb and well being of minor children
7156028 at least one in person medical evaluation of the patient
7156029 to an individual under the age of 18 years including any such sale using the internet
7156030 the chairman will be required to hold this meeting in this largest room in the capitol and there will be lines wandering all the way down to the white house
7156031 season 4 he really wanted to stay back in panama with sofia and his son l j but his conscious got the better of him and he followed his brother michael back to the states to help him out
7156032 i am and always have been a strong supporter of an 8 29 investigation into the levee failures that caused massive devastation in new orleans st bernard and surrounding communities in congress i have worked with sen mary landrieu to
7156033 the katrina myth the truth about a thoroughly unnatural disaster
7156034 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
7156035 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
7156036 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
7156037 ke kazzo volete da tom e bill kaulitz siete forse invidiosi dei tokio hotel cercate rogna secondo me siete gelosi della loro bellezza e bravura infinita se vi stanno sul kazzo annatevene a butt da 1 ponte e nn rompeteci i coglioni brutti rognosi by th girls p s siete solo dei mongoflettici mongoloidi mongospastici mongoli mongappati struppi ma andatevene a fare in culo rispondete in molti ahahahahahahahahaha naturalmente se avate coraggio siete bacucchi scaduti

7156040 have you bored yourself at last in this lust for blood
7156041 am i now to become pray to a lust to bring death
7156042 must you continue to see me as a monster no joy comes from causing death
7156043 must this scarred face be an infection which poisons our love
7156044 its already earned my sisters fear in place of loathing a mask a forced addition to clothing pity comes too late
7156045 so turn around and face your own fate an eternity with a phantom of a man before your eyes

7156071 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7156072 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7156073 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7156074 i knew i needed a break and he gave it to me all i can do is force him to run hard and he made a mistake im lucky
7156075 i just got loose down there and made a mistake and gave it away
7156076 biden is a brawler and the obama camp is eager to unleash him
7156077 two male career politicians from the senate is hardly transformational
7156078 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president

7156120 vivimos en una sociedad muy competitiva y la falta de tiempo es la nota dominante si esto lo traducimos al funcionamiento personal tendremos a individuos que buscan conseguir sus resultados en el menor tiempo posible reconocimiento laboral desde el primer momento ajuste con la pareja desde el principio de la relaci n comportamiento impecable de los hijos sin dedicar grandes esfuerzos y tiempo a su educaci n una comida suculenta sin esfuerzo ni largas esperas en la cocina

7156122 la incapacidad para demorar el esfuerzo se observa mucho en la infancia y en la adolescencia uno vive el presente de forma tan intensa que es capaz de sacrificar algo de su tiempo en beneficio de un bienestar mayor a medio largo plazo a veces se confunde el vivir el presente con no pensar en el futuro

7156141 the economy is in a bad situation and the need is growing
7156142 in july we served the highest number of meals in the 25 year history of the holy apostles soup kitchen and this month we are on track to break that record only yesterday aug 20 we served 1 691 meals
7156143 its hard to imagine a higher budget priority than ensuring that all families have enough to eat
7156144 surely a much better alternative would have been restoring previous fairer levels of taxation to the very wealthiest people who earn income in new york
7156145 they are not willing to talk about increasing taxes but at a certain point it becomes the responsibility of government to care for the common good
7156146 we are in trouble as a society and we need to have a larger discussion about what the common good is what are the responsibilities of elected officials and stop pretending that hunger and homelessness do not exist
7156147 several republican senators hagel lugar and specter have also offered praise for biden an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7156148 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7156149 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
7156150 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
7156151 united states officers and employees outside the governors office in ghazni afghanistan on jul 17 no soldiers were reported injured in the incident but aafia received bullet injuries
7156152 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
7156153 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
7156154 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
7156155 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
7156156 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
7156157 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
7156158 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
7156159 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
7156160 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
7156161 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
7156162 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
7156163 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
7156164 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
7156165 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
7156166 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
7156167 passion its not pefection in fact the root word here is passio the latin word for pain
7156168 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7156169 california impliedly allows parents to home school as a private school but has provided no enforcement mechanism as long as the local school district verifies that a private school affidavit has been filed there is no provision for further oversight of a home school it appears that the propriety of any parents home schooling will arise only in dependency or family law proceedings as in this case or in a prosecution for failing to comply with the compulsory education law
7156170 i can see why academically youd take him out of school but what about the social aspect
7156171 to educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society

7156174 we consider this one of our most successful olympic games ever u
7156175 the team will surpass the total medal count in athens 102 but that doesnt tell the whole story
7156176 this team has represented the nation in exemplary fashion and brought honor to the united states
7156177 whats good for us as a country is overall participation
7156178 were fascinated like any country with gold medals but whats more important is for team sports to do well because thats what gets kids out of chairs and playing
7156179 our womens soccer team played very well they won gold but more important in a way for our country their actions will bring thousands more kids in to play that sport thats good for the health of the country
7156180 senator bidens well known commitment to his catholic faith has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women his faith has helped him to find solace during times of tragedy and crisis we are optimistic that senator bidens history of seeking practical means of addressing abortion will help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate that has come to surround the issue senator biden accepts his churchs teachings on human life and can work to advance these teachings in ways that americans of all political persuasions can support catholics united is especially hopeful that operatives on the far right will refrain from using senator bidens faith and the teachings of the catholic church as political weapons in the coming campaign faith and values should be used to unite americans behind solutions to the key challenges of this age war poverty lack of health care and a looming climate crisis and not as partisan wedges to divide voters
7156181 not always buying new is one of the best ways people can cut down on trash for example in our county there is a store where people can get doors windows etcetera from houses that have been torn down people can even come into a house before it is taken apart and say what they want
7156182 think carefully about what you buy in the first place

7156188 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal

7156194 everybodys got his back and is behind him 100 percent and wants him to succeed but maybe he needs somebody to tell him not to put so much pressure on himself or whatever it is hes a great player and a tremendous right fielder thats why even when hes struggling with the bat hes in there every day because he can play right field and hes as great as anybody out there hes a professional and he was an mvp in japan hell figure out a way to get it going hell continue to play a huge part of our team over here
7156195 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
7156196 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7156197 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7156198 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7156199 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7156200 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging

7156244 construction costs and materials and labour have escalated to the point where the project is not feasible right now
7156245 i want to say how regrettable it is the impact that this will have on our purchasers on our suppliers and contractors and on our employees this is a really tough time
7156246 but it is really important for all purchasers to know that their deposits are fully protected theyre being held in trust at a law firm and theyre also protected under the provisions of the alberta new home warranty program

7156255 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7156256 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7156257 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7156258 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7156259 everything i hit everything i putt just falls in the hole
7156260 i knew i had to make par so i just thought that the odd stance would have been the best option for me actually making par
7156261 it was kind of new territory for me this week and i had to flip the switch and turn it around and get something positive going
7156262 he just seemed to make a couple more of those 10 to 15 footers

7156269 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7156270 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7156271 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7156272 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7156273 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7156274 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7156275 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7156276 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7156277 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7156278 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7156279 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7156280 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7156281 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7156282 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7156283 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7156284 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7156285 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7156286 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7156287 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7156288 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7156289 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
7156290 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7156291 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7156292 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7156293 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7156294 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7156295 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7156296 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7156297 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7156298 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7156299 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7156300 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7156301 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7156302 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7156303 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7156304 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7156305 this is a planning took where all things are going
7156306 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7156307 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7156308 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7156309 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7156310 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7156311 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7156312 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7156313 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7156314 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7156315 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7156316 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7156317 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7156318 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7156319 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7156320 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7156321 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7156322 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7156323 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7156324 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7156325 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7156326 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7156327 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7156328 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7156329 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7156330 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7156331 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7156332 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7156333 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7156334 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7156335 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7156336 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7156337 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7156338 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7156339 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7156340 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7156341 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7156342 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7156343 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7156344 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7156345 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7156346 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7156347 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7156348 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7156349 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7156350 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7156351 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7156352 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7156353 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7156354 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7156355 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7156356 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7156357 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7156358 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7156359 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7156360 i know how to enter grand slams second seeded federer said
7156361 i know how to enter the us open and what it takes to win thats a huge advantage i have
7156362 i come here as the defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7156363 i believe it is an advantage if you know how to win a us open federer said
7156364 rafa has never been beyond the fourth round so that is definitely the advantage that i carry
7156365 for five years i was expected to win every tournament federer said
7156366 so now it changes a little bit rafa will feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7156367 i tried to save a lot of energy at the beginning of the year so i would get through the entire season without a problem said federer who won the gold medal in doubles at the beijing olympics
7156368 i had a tough beginning to the season and i have been playing catchup all the way through
7156369 it is just a matter of winning a lot of matches in a row i really feel like this is going to happen at the us open
7156370 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7156371 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7156372 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7156373 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7156374 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7156375 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7156376 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7156377 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance
7156378 well they print the catalogues far in advance and cant always offer the same prices as we do on the website they are two different operations but the goods come from the same place
7156379 she was real close to my family so from the time i was little mike was always around
7156380 we used to joke that bunky was our oldest son
7156381 i think bunky has had as hard a time with this as anybody
7156382 he and dad were real close this has really hit him hard
7156383 lon wound up bent over at the side of the road just heaving
7156384 mike wound up face down in the lake he was so hot
7156385 but he never took it too seriously he really enjoyed the sport mostly i think he enjoyed the cycling with his buddies he had a really good time
7156386 mike always said i could do a triathlon but i just wasnt obsessed enough
7156387 ive just tried to get my body used to going these distances
7156388 but bunky has certainly put the training in for this thing thats the whole key to why he can do this
7156389 hes got a very deep desire to do this because hes doing it for mike
7156390 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into

7156416 probably my most poignant seder memory is not with the bergers but what happened right after i came back from meeting golda meir in 1973 i had predicted that something was going on in egypt and i remember people talking about what it meant to them if israel were actually defeated
7156417 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
7156418 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq
7156419 is that many americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring
7156420 he has to serve his sentence theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency but there is not a rationale to say what happened did not happen and should be pardoned
7156421 my worry is that if i were president to go and pardon pollard would make a lie out of the notion that there are certain rules you cannot give classified information period even to a friend if this were great britain it would be the same thing

7156518 in anticipation of the rain we do have flash flood watches still in effect as a precaution for the northshore and southshore through monday morning and into the evening hours for the possibility that we could see some very heavy rain
7156519 possibly in some spots up to five inches thats going to be the bigger threat to watch for
7156520 i dont want everybody to think that everything is over because weve got to watch this thing
7156521 as it made its move to north it could very well come back more to the south
7156522 the national weather service is telling us it will probably be more of a rain event additional rain of 2 to 5 inches here in st tammany
7156523 the winds are expected to be right around 30 or 35 miles per hour
7156524 the environmental conditions are forecast to become quite favorable for development next week and i do think this storm will become a tropical depression by monday or tuesday if not before then
7156525 i do not expect tropical cyclone development from 94 l for the day or two however as conditions become more favorable next week i suspect that it will become a tropical depression by monday or tuesday
7156526 this system will need to be watched very closely in the caribbean and it does pose a threat to hispaniola cuba and jamaica around the middle of next week further down the road based on the overall pattern next week into the following week this system may get very close to and possibly impact the us coastline
7156527 any development of this system is likely to be slow during the next couple of days as the wave moves westward at 15 mph

7156534 having hiv gives you a different outlook on life you think this could be my last thanksgiving my last christmas my last day you think about how you want people to remember you
7156535 most people think hiv is from doing things you think people shouldnt be doing and were quick to judge the truth is everyone makes mistakes
7156536 im seeing a lot of college kids with hiv what were seeing now are people in their 60s or older being diagnosed
7156537 blood transfusions are screened now but these people got transfusions in the 1970s or 1980s and are just now becoming symptomatic
7156538 originally people thought aids was only in new york and maybe in san francisco you didnt think you could get it and you didnt think a lot about it
7156539 youd hear about people being sick in the hospital and then theyd be dead youd never see them again
7156540 people wouldnt tell anyone if they had it because they were afraid of what could happen youd lose your job friends would be afraid to go near you
7156541 he looked at me and said why is this happening to me and not to you
7156542 i would love to have to look for a new job
7156543 there are only three ways you can get it sex intravenous drug use and if youre a mother you can give it to your child in the womb
7156544 you can get hiv from oral sex a lot of people think thats safe but its not
7156545 parents think if i talk about it its like giving permission but the cdc and statistics say thats not the case plus its hard to talk to your kids about sex i have a son i can talk to you about this all day long but its different to have to talk to him
7156546 if you take care of yourself you can live with it for decades my goal for someone with hiv is that they die at 80 from something unrelated to hiv
7156547 in the mid 90s when i began treating hiv there was only one drug azt
7156548 people used to think that after 10 years of being diagnosed as positive your body couldnt handle it and youd die but here i am
7156549 one of the biggest challenges for our county is caring for those people without resources
7156550 it can cost a minimum of 1 000 a month for hiv medications we have incredibly potent medicines that work but theyre very expensive
7156551 the cdc put out that hiv testing ought to be standard in routine blood tests but theres still a large stigma
7156552 people need to know to go to the health department or alamance cares and get free testing
7156553 wed water the tomatoes we put a little water on each plant to make it look like we watered them good then wed walk up to midway creek
7156554 then wed walk up to rocky run and hay creek
7156555 i clocked that in the car john barber 90 of duluth swings a crappie aboard while fishing on wild rice lake north of duluth minn july 30 2008 ap photo sam cook duluth news tribune ap the other day it was 10 miles one way wed think nothing of it
7156556 then i rowed a boat all day then id ride the bike back home
7156557 one time we drove back to duluth with a bunch of big northerns on the hood of our car
7156558 mom would bake 12 loaves of bread every other day

7156568 do i really need to get these wisdom teeth out
7156569 hey lets get out of here we dont need to get wisdom teeth out right
7156570 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7156571 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7156572 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7156573 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7156574 we hope to give them information about china they might not get otherwise
7156575 and see other kids their own age and learn about adoption and another culture at the same time
7156576 im anxious to see how people are going to attack us
7156577 i think theyll try to reduce us and try to get seven guys in in the box i think people will take an approach where they try to pass on us first and run on us second
7156578 i know this our offense is happy theyre not seeing a whole lot of marylands defense anymore
7156579 i dont really think we have the defense perfected the way i want to have it but were working on it some days its really good and some days weve got to get better at it im anxious to see how we do once the season is underway im anxious to see how we turn out
7156580 what seemed like a brilliant exercise in media management devolved into a late night rearguard maneuver
7156581 the completion of our pathfinder operation builds on last years successful sounding rocket flight test and brings us one step closer to realizing our goal of developing an affordable launch vehicle that supports numerous military scientific and commercial missions
7156582 by incorporating off the shelf components and technologies into the program and minimizing ground support requirements we believe atk can offer our customers a reliable and low life cycle cost launch vehicle
7156583 nasa is very disappointed in this failure but has directed its focus on protecting public safety and conducting a comprehensive investigation to identify the root cause
7156584 nasa is assembling a multidiscipline team along with the rockets maker alliant tech systems or atk of salt lake city to begin the investigation promptly
7156585 we should be able to conquer some of the challenges of hypersonic flight if we can get a better handle on air flow
7156586 at hypersonic speeds the temperature of the flow around the aircraft or spacecraft is so great that it affects just about everything that includes the shape of the vehicle the material its made of and even the chemistry of the molecules in the air
7156587 the scramp design offers a super stable re entry system sort of like a big hypersonic badminton birdie that rights itself nose forward after tumbling
7156588 the slot between the cylinder and the circular heat shield also enhances drag and stability
7156589 one of the three fields had an 83 percent hunter success rate with some harvesting 5 birds or more hunter density was high at guadalupe county leases
7156590 i bet you dont have a plug in that gun do you
7156591 strathclyde police are still investigating this matter very thoroughly at present we are questioning neighbours and possible witnesses to this crime we are also in the process of studying forensic evidence found at the scene of the crime once we know more we will release details to friends and family of the victim
7156592 while we believe the young man you mentioned did have a few enemies we cannot begin investigating that line of inquiry until we get confirmation of the identity of the victim and the cause of death
7156593 i dont believe they had reason to shoot four times just like that nothing justifies a death
7156594 my brother said what are you doing with my brother let go of him then i heard gunshots and my brother fell to the ground
7156595 its so important to have a transparent investigation to know what really happened
7156596 but they havent taken the police officers testimony yet what are they waiting for
7156597 if it happens once it can happen again and it has happened before
7156598 they are treating everyone in the neighborhood like they are would be gang members
7156599 there is poverty and a lot of social problems in neighborhoods like montreal nord but instead of dealing with poverty like by giving money to community groups they give millions of dollars to cops
7156600 caravans of 10 or 15 police cars will come into the neighborhood all of a sudden and we feel very insecure because it seems like anything can happen from one moment to the next it makes us feel very intimidated to have so many police everywhere
7156601 they see a few young people and even if there are little kids around they approach them trying to intimidate or what are they looking for they are provoking things trying to take this to the next level
7156602 they kill people and theyre not even accused of any misdoing
7156603 so they get away with it thats what we call impunity and because of it they know they can kill people so they just keep on acting like they can do whatever they want
7156604 and things like this happen because the politicians are too afraid to control the police more and they will continue to happen if nothing happens to these cops
7156605 the cops investigate themselves and there are no accusations so we never really know what truly happened the cops are not even suspended
7156606 that such practices are common within the different police services in quebec
7156607 so it really sends a message that the city and the government are backing the police
7156608 even if they say they think about the family and all that but they really seem more upset that there was a riot than the fact that the cops killed an unarmed youth
7156609 i dont think he can lead montreal nord correctly because hes not listening to his people
7156610 if he was listening to his people maybe fredy villanueva would still be alive
7156611 these people want jobs houses families and are tired of police harassment
7156612 if you dont give them some options what are they going to do
7156613 the police are not here to help people theyre here to criminalize people and then they do things like killing people
7156614 this makes it so that everybody in the community feels alienated like they are being unjustly treated and thats one of the reasons why an explosion like the one we saw after the killing of fredy villanueva happened
7156615 a lot of police are good officers but they tolerate abuses by other police officers how come they dont say anything about that they ask the population to anonymously denounce criminals but then they let criminals in their own ranks
7156616 if we could respect the police the riot wouldnt have happened but right now
7156617 theres no trust no respect we know what happened that night and thats why we want change
7156618 a pity that all who would still give a damn are dead except for me
7156619 perhaps to make some amends for what i did in the past we could bring you up to date on some of the things you may have missed during your absence
7156620 it looks like life wasnt as graceful to you as it obviously was to me
7156621 that wasnt be necessary i only wanted to help you

7156626 but what id like to know is how we are going to be returning to our own time
7156627 but from the readouts that we got from our scans of the eddy and your vessel if there is a way it may not be easy
7156628 this is what we would be facing if we tried to directly send your little tower back into the eddy
7156629 bringing your vessel to the anomaly without proper adjustments would literally tear it apart and may even
7156630 disrupt the flow of space time and destroy the bajoran system and us with it
7156631 i hope option two tell me you do have an option two is much better
7156632 a pity that all who would still give a damn are dead except for me
7156633 perhaps to make some amends for what i did in the past we could bring you up to date on some of the things you may have missed during your absence
7156634 it looks like life wasnt as graceful to you as it obviously was to me

7156636 you still dont trust me even after all this time

7156638 there are only a few things in this vast universe that could turn my stomach enough to ill me unfortunately it had to be you trelane
7156639 none of us like the situation but were here and we need to make the best of it
7156640 but what id like to know is how we are going to be returning to our own time
7156641 but from the readouts that we got from our scans of the eddy and your vessel if there is a way it may not be easy
7156642 this is what we would be facing if we tried to directly send your little tower back into the eddy

7156645 i hope option two tell me you do have an option two is much better

7156655 i give a mandatory response to his challenge that forces him to laugh
7156656 you know how many sorry ass motherfuckers round here this very evening looking for a ride home and got
7156657 he responds to my response forcing me to laugh also which eases the tension and now we both can back down from confrontation without losing face
7156658 well i guess well cross that bridge when we get to it
7156659 look man once you get in there first thing you do is go downstairs open the side door and let me in they keep it locked on the outside so security wont have to cover it but it opens from the inside in case of fire ive never seen any alarm systems on these dorms remember dont do nothing stupid dont say nothing stupid you get in then let me in and then just be cool an let me do the talkin these aint no high school girls we dealin wit this is grown woman pussy i know how to deal with grown women you still think like a high school boy cause youze still a young boy in the mind

7156665 part of the reason home prices are declining is a fundamental deterioration in the housing stock
7156666 during the boom nine out of 10 houses for sale in many markets were in prime condition now for every 10 houses at least three are dogs
7156667 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me

7156725 the world at the turn of the century which had experienced relative peace for approximately 40 years was becoming increasingly unstable this instability was accompanied by uprisings in the colonies and in rising tensions between world powers
7156726 there was expressed at every point the fear that the making of the treaty would be followed by the curtailment of hunting and fishing privileges and many were impressed with the notion that the treaty would lead to taxation and enforced military service we assured them that the treaty would not lead to any forced interference with their mode of life that it did not open the way to the imposition of any tax and there was no fear of enforced military service

7156732 tony was killed by a sniper in december 2005 while he was on patrol in fallujah our family went through all of the stages that follow such a tragedy shock grief numbness and acceptance but as i visited other families who lost young people in the war and as i attended the funerals of other fallen service men and women it occurred to me that there was no lasting tangible symbol that these families could use to honor their lost loved one there are two things that parents long for when they lose a child this way first they want their childs death not to have been in vain and secondly they want their childs sacrifice to be remembered

7156758 therefore by the authority which christ conferred upon peter and his successors and in communion with the bishops of the catholic church i confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral
7156759 the deliberate decision to deprive an innocent human being of his life is always morally evil and can never be licit either as an end in itself or as a means to a good end
7156760 nothing and no one can in any way permit the killing of an innocent human being whether a fetus or an embryo an infant or an adult an old person or one suffering from an incurable disease or a person who is dying furthermore no one is permitted to ask for this act of killing either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care nor can he or she consent to it either explicitly or implicitly nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action
7156761 as far as the right to life is concerned every innocent human being is absolutely equal to all others
7156762 there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone it makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the poorest of the poor on the face of the earth before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal

7156817 we havent given him the best run support but every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches and again he pitched great today
7156818 hes been the type of guy that has been plugging away
7156819 unfortunately he hasnt had the best couple of weeks but hes been a player in there working hard every single day so for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7156820 hes pitched some good ballgames where he got some losses and hes pitched some real close ones where he didnt get any decisions
7156821 thats my mind set to really focus on preventing runs instead of watching how many runs we have
7156822 were capable of scoring definitely more than three runs a night
7156823 when were clicking were going to average about five runs a game when were really good once we get consistent and start scoring runs like we can and our pitching stays as good as its been were going to win quite a few games
7156824 were putting a lot of pressure on our pitchers because were not scoring runs
7156825 hopefully the fans can sit back and watch us today because were busting our butts
7156826 youre not going to see everything fall like you did friday
7156827 we had a lot of chances at the end of the game we had a lapse it would have been nice to go one run down to see if we could have rallied
7156828 they dont get credit for it because were losing but ive always been proud of them weve gone through hell here the last couple of weeks they havent lost their concentration or their desire to win
7156829 he was playing deep and i kind of had to wait a little bit to throw the ball
7156830 obviously i dont want to hit him in the back while hes running to the bag
7156831 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7156832 youve got to be cold blooded to be in that situation and actually only focus on seeing the ball and staying in your zone
7156833 i knew he was a great pitcher with a great fastball
7156834 he throws real hard but i knew the situation with the bases loaded i was trying to get the runs in at the time
7156835 that was one of the toughest games for me in my career one of the toughest that ive lost
7156836 just being ahead like that and boom we lost it was just a tough game to swallow
7156837 amazing great job to be able to get to him in that inning and get to the bullpen it says a lot about how much our guys battled at bat for at bat
7156838 both those pitches that he hit out i really liked them

7156988 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
7156989 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7156990 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7156991 we also call for respect for free expression to become one of the criteria when selecting cities to host the games
7156992 we hail all those in china and abroad who did not stop pressing for more freedom of expression before the olympic games
7156993 we will remain vigilant in case the post olympic period ushers in a new wave of repression
7156994 they dont stop following me filming me and photographing me

7157002 brothers stem cells are producing new blood cells now in my body and its just going to take a while for me to build my immunity up so its been nothing but goodness since we got out and im just happy to be out of the hospital
7157003 i feel good you just take a nap during the day they said thats pretty normal especially with the medication that you take but other than that ive got to wear a mask when i leave the house

7157011 a very unique arm for being his age being 15 years in the league to be able to spin it like he can
7157012 hes still got great velocity and can negotiate the ball well over 60 yards down the field
7157013 hes a positive in terms of leadership with the other guys too hes also a coach on the field for me he helps t jack find out where the bones are buried on certain plays hes a great help

7157060 he who does not respect the elderly among us is not merciful to the youngsters among us and does not command the lawful and forbid the unlawful is not following our methodology
7157061 there are people whose skin is the same color as ours who speak the same language as we speak they mix correct matters which you know with bad matters which you denounce they mix the correct statements with the deviated ones they stand by the gates of hellfire inviting others to enter if one listens to them they push him in

7157063 i was working at warrior amp gulf navigation at the time as a pilot and was actually downstream 40 50 miles from the rooster bridge when the incident occurred
7157064 river conditions were extremely bad that spring one of the highest rises on the tombigbee
7157065 at that point the raging current took over and laid the cahaba starboard side to against the bridge once the port lower deck went awash there was no chance for recovery capt wilkerson in effect took a 37 foot tall towboat and put it through a 11 foot span
7157066 all right yall this aint no fire drill get off the damn bridge
7157067 one of the two detroit 16 149s was still running the port one had flooded out capt wilkerson said at one point he was straddled across the port wheelhouse door when the front window popped out and the wheelhouse filled with water
7157068 the reason these pictures stayed out of circulation for so long
7157069 several years later the rooster bridge was replaced with a high rise a few miles north and the original bridge was taken out much to the relief of all of us who navigated the tombigbee

7157076 it is not permitted to glorify buildings and historical sites
7157077 such action would lead to polytheism s o it is necessary to reject such acts and to warn others away from them

7157080 the government has finally woken up to the commercial value of religious tourism
7157081 and they are really the ones driving this construction boom in mecca
7157082 it is equally fundamentalist to say that we have to keep everything exactly the way it was while the world around us is changing every day

7157266 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that

7157268 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7157269 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly

7157295 folks again its not political sloganary when i say we literally cant afford four more years of this non energy policy written by and for the oil companies making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally not figuratively literally putting americas security at risk we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world
7157296 obama will have such an incredible opportunity incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally literally to change the direction of the world

7157303 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7157304 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7157305 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7157306 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7157307 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7157308 thats not a worry has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7157309 ive been out of the hospital for about three weeks now
7157310 there are a couple things that kind of give you that impression one is a biopsy which is just them taking a piece of your bone marrow out of your back and just seeing whats being produced at your bone marrow
7157311 brothers stem cells are producing new blood cells now in my body and its just going to take a while for me to build my immunity up so its been nothing but goodness since we got out and im just happy to be out of the hospital
7157312 i feel good you just take a nap during the day they said thats pretty normal especially with the medication that you take but other than that ive got to wear a mask when i leave the house
7157313 yeah i mean ive got my strength i cant just jump back into a workout just yet because i have to wear masks for three months out of the hospital so its almost been a month and thats to prevent like a fungus that you can get if you dont wear a mask when you go outside
7157314 oh yeah im very sure that everything is going to work out just fine
7157315 i appreciate that i didnt even realize it until just out of nowhere weve been receiving a lot of support from everybody and everywhere
7157316 frerottes got a great wealth of knowledge and he can still spin it for a guy his age
7157317 i mean hes really got great arm strength and great command of the ball i think his accuracy and his experience and his arm strength theyre all real positive about it obviously he brings a wealth of knowledge to the game
7157318 i thought it was a great get for us and i think hes made us better
7157319 hes got a different skill set in terms of his mobility and things like that but certainly hes capable of doing anything that we do he can negotiate all the throws he can get it down the field he can chuck it down he can do all the things that were required to do in this offense
7157320 a very unique arm for being his age being 15 years in the league to be able to spin it like he can
7157321 hes still got great velocity and can negotiate the ball well over 60 yards down the field
7157322 hes a positive in terms of leadership with the other guys too hes also a coach on the field for me he helps t jack find out where the bones are buried on certain plays hes a great help
7157323 will host an interfaith gathering at the convention center the gathering will include clergy of different faiths party leaders elected officials and local community leaders
7157324 senator obama is a committed christian and he believes that people of all faiths have an important place in american life hes proud to work with the democratic national convention committee on a convention that fully engages people of faith in dialogue celebration and prayer we are honored that so many religious leaders are reaching across partisan and ideological lines in this convention to address the values that matter to americans
7157325 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this convention will demonstrate that in an unprecedented way as convention ceo and a pastor myself i am incredibly proud that so many esteemed leaders from the faith community will be with us to celebrate this historic occasion and honor the diverse faith traditions inside the democratic party
7157326 a reception with inspirational music to honor religious leaders and activists who safeguard and promote reproductive health and reproductive justice
7157327 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7157328 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
7157329 im very appreciative of the situation that i worked out with the new york jets which enabled me to put my career on hold and do something i had to do
7157330 i had no choice i wouldve been in big trouble
7157331 when i first bought it i was really down on it its growing on me a little but i still dont think its pink floyd as pink floyd should be it shows them as being bored with what they do
7157332 musically i think theyre a little less daring than they have been i dont think this is a par excellence work as the last one can be considered i want to listen to it more before i make a final decision
7157333 im a little disappointed actually none of the album really stays in my head it just doesnt seem to be that powerful when they did the song echoes i really could visualize being out in a field or forest watching the sun come up over a pond in the mist but this album hasnt had any effect on me so far
7157334 i like the theme that runs through the whole thing
7157335 this new album good i dont have it myself but ive heard it many a time because all my friends have it rs 199 you
7157336 super bowl are you kidding me super bowl im just hoping we can win a playoff game
7157337 we obviously feel were going to make the playoffs weve got to win a playoff game first before we do anything until we get that done there is no super bowl
7157338 all that speaks volumes to what i think we ought to be
7157339 we feel like we are that good and we belong in those games
7157340 we belong in those situations and we are going to try to put ourselves in that situation for the next decade and if we can well eventually break through
7157341 no one has to adjust to any new players coming in and stuff like that
7157342 we know what we want to achieve so i think that already everybody is on the same page that makes it a lot easier to get out here and move forward
7157343 we cant focus on the stuff from the past because it will haunt us
7157344 there was a little voice inside that said i have something more for you
7157345 your wife has to really be a part of this
7157346 a job is something you leave this is different this is like being a grandfather you dont want to give it up
7157347 every day after work it was such a tranquil and elegant environment
7157348 we were childhood friends and saw each other every day
7157349 but this is good for them theyre making a lot of money now
7157350 most of the people now living in the hutongs are actually newcomers from outside beijing
7157351 of course its a good business move but if you think about how it harms the ambiance the whole thing doesnt feel right
7157352 all these people come to see beijings hutongs because it shows you the common peoples lives and their culture if everyone buys the homes and live there the irony is its not representative anymore

7157354 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7157355 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7157356 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7157357 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7157358 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7157359 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7157360 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7157361 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7157362 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7157363 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7157364 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7157365 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7157366 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7157367 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7157368 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7157369 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7157370 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films

7157376 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future

7157387 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7157388 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7157389 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7157390 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope

7157398 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7157399 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7157400 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7157401 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7157402 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7157403 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7157404 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7157405 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7157406 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7157407 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7157408 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7157409 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7157410 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7157411 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7157412 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7157413 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7157414 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7157415 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7157416 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7157417 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7157418 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7157419 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7157420 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7157421 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7157422 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7157423 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7157424 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7157425 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7157426 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7157427 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7157428 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7157429 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7157430 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7157431 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7157432 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7157433 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7157434 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7157435 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7157436 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7157437 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7157438 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7157439 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7157440 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7157441 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7157442 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7157443 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7157444 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7157445 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7157446 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7157447 available which is a great way to show your republican pride and support of john mccain the kit includes a mccain t shirt buttons a mccain hat and a mccain travel mug
7157448 id like to pass along to you what i believe is the most complete accounting of how my friend john mccain helped our nation avoid a disaster in iraq
7157449 when you read this article youll understand better what john mccain was up against people told him he was wrong people told him it would cost him his chance for the nomination for president of the united states true to form john mccain decided to listen to the commanders on the ground hed seen the situation with his own eyes and his years of experience in military and foreign affairs convinced him that he could not ignore what was happening in iraq what the commanders were saying and the solution that was required
7157450 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
7157451 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7157452 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7157453 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7157454 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7157455 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7157456 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7157457 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7157458 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7157459 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7157460 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7157461 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7157462 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7157463 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7157464 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7157465 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7157466 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7157467 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7157468 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7157469 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7157470 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7157471 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7157472 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7157473 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7157474 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7157475 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7157476 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7157477 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7157478 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7157479 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7157480 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7157481 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7157482 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7157483 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7157484 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7157485 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7157486 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7157487 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7157488 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7157489 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7157490 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7157491 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7157492 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7157493 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7157494 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7157495 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7157496 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7157497 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7157498 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7157499 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7157500 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7157501 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7157502 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7157503 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7157504 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7157505 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7157506 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7157507 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7157508 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7157509 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7157510 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7157511 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7157512 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7157513 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7157514 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7157515 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7157516 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7157517 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7157518 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7157519 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7157520 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7157521 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7157522 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7157523 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7157524 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7157525 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7157526 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7157527 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7157528 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7157529 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7157530 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7157531 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7157532 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7157533 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7157534 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7157535 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7157536 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7157537 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7157538 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7157539 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7157540 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7157541 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7157542 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7157543 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7157544 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7157545 take the santa monica fwy 10 east to the harbor fwy 110 north to the hollywood fwy 101 north exit at vermont avenue turn right onto vermont and drive north to santa monica boulevard turn right onto santa monica blvd and drive east to the junction of santa monica blvd and hoover street parking available at l a c c vermont amp willowbrook
7157546 insults flew as business owners absorbed the news broken this morning by the sjna that alcohol will not be allowed along the stretch of sunset boulevard between sanborn and edgecliffe where the bulk of sunset junctions businesses stand
7157547 i am not going to waste my time with that festival this year and a 20 entry fee is just plain greedy and ridiculous its a street fair geez i will not support just based on that but the way the merchants are being disrespected is the final straw
7157548 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7157549 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7157550 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7157551 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7157552 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7157553 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7157554 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7157555 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7157556 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7157557 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7157558 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7157559 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7157560 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7157561 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7157562 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7157563 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7157564 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7157565 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7157566 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7157567 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7157568 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7157569 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7157570 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7157571 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7157572 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7157573 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7157574 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7157575 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7157576 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7157577 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7157578 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7157579 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7157580 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7157581 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7157582 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7157583 m j b u b j b b j b n v n atel a w p t x a i
7157584 threw down his 84kg greco roman bronze in disgust after his shot at gold was ended by a decision denounced by the swedish coach as
7157585 the olympic charter and filas own rules about fair play
7157586 we limit ourselves to ruling that fila must consistently with the olympic charter and general principles of fairness establish for the future a jury of appeal to determine the validity or otherwise of complaints of the kind ventilated by abrahamian
7157587 please note there might be duplicate districts and groups names in different geographies
7157588 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
7157589 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
7157590 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7157591 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7157592 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7157593 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7157594 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7157595 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7157596 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7157597 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7157598 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7157599 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7157600 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7157601 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7157602 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7157603 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7157604 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7157605 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7157606 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7157607 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7157608 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7157609 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7157610 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7157611 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7157612 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7157613 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary

7157616 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7157617 rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase they have also expressed a wish to ban the albums singers and producers most notably sting john mayer and dave matthews from entering china
7157618 youve already swiped in hardly anyone is here today anyway no one will know
7157619 theres one more problem though i dont have my phone its in my apartment
7157620 apple is a 30 billion company yet weve got less than 30 major products
7157621 im actually as proud of many of the things we havent done as the things we have done the clearest example was when we were pressured for years to do a pda and i realized one day that 90 of the people who use a pda only take information out of it on the road they dont put information into it pretty soon cellphones are going to do that so the pda markets going to get reduced to a fraction of its current size and it wont really be sustainable so we decided not to get into it if we had gotten into it we wouldnt have had the resources to do the ipod we probably wouldnt have seen it coming
7157622 we are extremely excited to have someone of the caliber of jeff fox speak to our group
7157623 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7157624 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7157625 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7157626 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7157627 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7157628 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7157629 thats not a worry has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7157630 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7157631 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lay in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
7157632 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
7157633 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
7157634 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back
7157635 this is such a huge disappointment for me i came here in great shape and the cut mark 6 75 for the final looked well within reach but somehow it was not to be today

7157654 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7157655 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7157656 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging

7157819 we are playing catch up now because we have lost this game but we have to cope and bounce back in the next game on wednesday
7157820 we need a top class performance then because today was simply not good enough
7157821 its a disappointment fulham started stronger than us and they were sharper especially in the first half they didnt create many chances if you look at the whole game but they took advantage from a corner
7157822 we tried to come back but we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes we didnt keep calm in and around the box
7157823 we lacked a bit more quality in our passing than normal and if you look at how much possession we had that shows that technical quality is important as well
7157824 fulham have a good midfield and we werent at our best today the passing was not as good as it could be today either and that applied to every area

7157838 the conciliation bill which the parliamentary conciliation committee promoted obtained a majority of 109 in july 1910 a majority of whom favoured female enfranchisement however this decision provoked a crisis within the liberal party the conciliation bill proposed to enfranchise about one million women who were heads of households prominent liberals condemned the bill as fundamentally detrimental to the partys interests moreover the 1910 elections underlined the danger of taking any unnecessary risks by november 1911 the cabinet had resolved its dilemma in what at first appeared to be a neat way the government now intended to introduce a bill of its own to reform the registration of parliamentary electors though this would not include womens suffrage it would be open to amendment by suffragists in the commons this expedient had a number of short term results the prospect of achieving votes for all men reassured the liberal party the wlf were evidently satisfied that a government bill offered an excellent prospect and they concentrated on promoting an amendment to it conversely the pankhursts were provoked into a dramatic resumption of militancy which played into asquiths hands finally the prospect of a more democratic measure of womens suffrage attracted some liberals away from the conciliation bill and this combined with politicians reactions to the renewed suffragette violence led to a narrow defeat for that bill in 1912
7157839 although they believed the governments franchise bill had a better chance of success the nuwss continued to urge enactment of the conciliation bill
7157840 i think we are now nearly out of the wood
7157841 prominent liberals condemned the bill as fundamentally detrimental to the partys interests
7157842 parliament controlled london throughout the war a fact of very considerable significance in view of the citys importance as a supplier of both of money and of men most of the larger towns in the country were also under parliamentary authority as were most of the seaports even those in predominantly royalist areas control of london and the other ports gave the parliamentarians the ability to collect most of the customs revenue which continued to flow into the country parliament therefore controlled the greater part of the countrys wealth
7157843 royalist fiscal expedients remained essentially conservative in form as the war progressed a contribution was levied using traditional rating lists and collected by exiting local officials but by 1645 very little of this money was finding its way back to oxford with the consequence that during the latter stages of the war royalist troops were very poorly paid
7157844 in 1913 from one end of the country to the other a new militancy reared its desperate and comic head
7157845 over the winter of 1927 8 an agrarian crisis developed as wheat prices fell as rural distress spread peasants and small farmers switched their political allegiance to new radical peasant movements the agricultural crisis offered unexpected opportunities to radical right wing parties and the nazi party was not slow to exploit them the german mittelstand that section of society comprising artisans craftsmen small shopkeepers and public servants was by 1928 increasingly associating itself with the grievances of peasants and farmers in smaller communities the economic difficulties experienced by farmers quickly affected other tradespeople the levels of taxation markedly above pre war levels the contributions to welfare services and increased bureaucracy infuriated small traders and business men
7157846 nor was everything rosy in the industrial sector in the mid 1920s heavy industry coal iron and steel was already experiencing problems with profitability and even in the relatively prosperous year of 1927 german steel mills worked at no more than 70 of their capacity the disaffection of coal and steel industrialists was demonstrated quite clearly the following year when a major industrial dispute took place in the ruhr and the employers locked out over a quarter of a million workers if some sections of big business were not exactly satisfied with their economic situation even in the mid 1920s the same could also be said of some sections of german labour it is true that the real wages of workers increased in the period 1924 28 but these gains were made at a certain cost the introduction of new technologies associated with serial production conveyor belts meant an intensification of labour an increase in the pace of work and an increase in the number of industrial accidents associated was the closure of small and inefficient units of production after 1924 many were without jobs even in the years of apparent prosperity the annual average number of registered unemployed stood at over 2 million in 1926 1 3 million in 1927 and nearly 1 4 million in 1928 politically the major beneficiary of this fact was the kpd which remained strong in many industrial areas such as the ruhr and berlin even in the supposedly good years
7157847 nazi propaganda was successful in cultivating an image of a party which was youthful and radical nationalist and both anti semitic and anti marxist it appeared to be sympathetic to small businesses and peasants but not hostile to the landowners however it is misleading to say that hitler and his party conquered the masses there is the danger of concentrating on the techniques of persuasion and not looking at the programme to vote for the nazi manifesto was not an irrational act as has been suggested many groups voted out of self interest rather than being persuaded by propaganda other groups remained resistant propaganda was not the determining factor but the failure of the weimar system it was important in mobilising support in opposition but it could not alone have sustained the nazi party nazi policies reflected many aspirations of large sections of populations propaganda reinforced existing beliefs and attitudes

7157874 kate has been asked many times to do charity work
7157875 she is often asked when she is out at parties i was with her at one event when a representative from a rather high profile charity suggested that kate get involved
7157876 she was really keen at the time and said she would love to get on board she gave the organiser all her details but when they wrote to her kate didnt even reply
7157877 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well
7157878 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7157879 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7157880 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7157881 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did

7157914 please help yourself and i believe you deserve the kindness what would make you think otherwise
7157915 that i am just treating you this way for physical desires to tell you the truth im trying to prove to you prove to myself that i am not the man that i once was ill be honest i do want you physically but i want you more then a physical partner a friend perhaps but i doubt you would give me the time or day for any of that the chance to be with you alone i will also be honest in saying that i will be hurt in it not happening but happy at the same time because you are safe from me
7157916 i dont even you and you want to be with me alone you dont know who i am yes thank you for your kindness towards me im just im just

7157932 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7157933 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7157934 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so

7157936 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time
7157937 sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on
7157938 not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7157939 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7157940 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7157941 hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7157942 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall

7157967 the attitude of the great coordinations of the international communist movement towards nepali revolution
7157968 the existing coordinations and aggregations of the international communist movement do not yet express themselves on the meaning of nepali revolution
7157969 none of the various aggregations of communist parties and organizations can set itself even as an embryo of a new international if it does not overcome this difficulty if it just restricts itself to denounce revisionism and imperialism if it does not propose a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others such proposals do not rise from some individual genius nor from the particular qualities of a single party or organization
7157970 the fact that they are able to denounce revisionists lies and imperialists crimes but they are not able to give their opinion or stutter about the situation in nepal where communists are advancing is a sign of their difficulties
7157971 aggregation suggests that they expect to be shaking up the alignments of communists internationally forging something new on a new basis
7157972 a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others
7157973 rise from the open and frank debate among the various communist parties and organizations on the international level
7157974 this debate then must be united to the practical organizations in all the struggle fronts against imperialism for defending the conquests of the working class and the peoples masses the oppressed people and nations women young people environment etc and to mutual solidarity so doing the debate cannot be reduced to an empty and abstract talking the common practice will confirm which positions are right and which are not

7157977 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
7157978 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
7157979 10 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
7157980 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
7157981 23 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps
7157982 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
7157983 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning
7157984 2 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
7157985 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
7157986 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission
7157987 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
7157988 13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
7157989 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles
7157990 10 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
7157991 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
7157992 44 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me
7157993 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
7157994 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls
7157995 24 i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
7157996 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
7157997 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
7157998 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone 18 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works 19 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble 20 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead 21 was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar 22 seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god 24 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
7157999 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
7158000 8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
7158001 29 therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
7158002 24 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for

7158022 if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is by believing that you are made right with god and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved
7158023 but how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him
7158024 if someone claims i know god but doesnt obey gods commandments that person is a liar and is not living in the truth but those who obey gods word truly show how completely they love him those who say they live in god should live their lives as jesus did
7158025 but when people keep on sinning it shows they belong to the devil who has been sinning since the beginning
7158026 when you sow you do not plant the body that will be but just a seed perhaps of wheat or of something else
7158027 here is my testimony about how jesus has changed my life
7158028 you know the saying one plants and another harvests and its true i sent you to harvest where you didnt plant others had already done the work and now you will get to gather the harvest
7158029 i planted the seed in your hearts and apollos watered it but it was god who made it grow its not important who does the planting or who does the watering whats important is that god makes the seed grow
7158030 regarding the clinical issues violence is a multifactorial behavior and i think its overly simplistic to reduce it to a simple medication cause and effect confounding variables are the presence of personality disorders previous acts of violence active affective disorder symptoms and co existing substance abuse we know nothing about these confounding variables from this article while clinical trial data will be useful to identify strong associations that could be attributed to medications eg weight gain increases in prolactin levels it is less useful for low base rate phenomena like homicide as roy has already pointed out base rates of general aggression were low to begin with in the clinical monitoring data from the uk
7158031 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7158032 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7158033 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7158034 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7158035 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging

7158051 the operations are strictly limited to the three commanders and their cohorts now its up to the milf if they will support their cohorts or not
7158052 if we will declare an all out war just as bravo did what will make us different from them
7158053 they now serve as eyes and ears of their colleagues out there in liguasan marsh
7158054 for as long as they remain in evacuation centers we are not going to touch them they are not our enemies our enemy here is kato
7158055 it would be another form of lawbreaking arming of civilians would not be necessary if the government is present and doing its job if at all this must be as a last resort
7158056 it is the right of the people and communities to fight but we must be careful because the firearms might end up in the hands of lawless elements
7158057 i am in favor of allowing the civilians to arm themselves and defend their communities
7158058 this will only lead to further extremism and isolate muslim filipinos from christians this is totally irresponsible of the dilg secretary
7158059 it is the duty of the military to protect the nation if the philippine army cannot do so this is a dire indication of the incompetence of the arroyo administration

7158079 that conservatives who practice religion live in traditional nuclear families and reject the notion that government should engage in income redistribution are the most generous americans by any measure
7158080 conservative households in america donate 30 percent more money to charity each year than liberal households

7158086 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay weve seen some research that says 60 per cent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again we have to ensure that the peripheral strategy that anyone employs makes sense and delivers a truly game changing experience because if its just okay it will end up in the cupboard under the stairs
7158087 parents who are concerned that their children will react negatively to one of the four bmi categories should use wii fit in such a way that the bmi tracker does not appear on screen
7158088 you know we always say that weve grown the company at about 7 percent per year in volume terms and we said yesterday we want to grow at another 10 percent over the next 12 months
7158089 the wii balance board is a great peripheral and we are considering utilizing it in our future development wii fit has been a great validation of the fitness category that we pioneered it has shown there is tremendous pent up demand for content for this audience
7158090 in the spring of this year we announced that starting from this summer 2008 we would have a monthly maximum production capacity for wii of 2 4 million and we are working with that schedule right now we are continuing to increase the maximum production capability however the expansion of the market for potential customers the number of people who are waiting to purchase wii is beyond our expectations right now so for the time being i really do not think that the imbalance for supply and demand can be solved immediately for example when we look back at the whole history of video games in the past it was unthinkable that other than during the november december time period we would have 700 000 monthly unit sales in u s alone
7158091 if we get 1 000 in on thursday or friday they are all gone by sunday we comfortably sell out of our allocation

7158139 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us
7158140 the taleban will surround kabul politically and militarily to make it hard for nato forces to receive logistic convoys
7158141 that will mean less nato movement and will show we can make trouble in the capital

7158176 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening

7158234 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7158235 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7158236 massive new investments in irrigation have been announced worldwide to help counter the food crisis yet water shortage means food shortage and if corruption in irrigation is not also addressed these efforts will fall short
7158237 people from eastern bani hushaish are known not to be involved with houthis hence theyre able to transport some of their foodstuffs into their villages they generally travel via khawlan road where many checkpoints use a khawlani assistant who knows whos who
7158238 im a major in the army and i participated in the first three wars in saada however im now surprised that a group of soldiers prevents me from delivering flour to feed my small children and family simply because im from bani hushaish
7158239 the security forces are going too far as theyre preventing us from transporting fruit and animal fodder across the checkpoints do they think houthis eat fodder or straw
7158240 a houthi wife once was caught attempting to smuggle out of the area she was carrying a gun discovered by policewomen who then questioned her and learned that she was from the houthi inhabited area
7158241 we took her aside and advised her that it would be better for her and her family if she disclosed her husbands location or convinced him to surrender himself to the authorities
7158242 every time theres a new security official we must go through the entire process of identifying ourselves again and our business in the district they fear that every stranger might be a houthi follower
7158243 to the extent that some european countries stipulate that imported agricultural products must be organic
7158244 we found out that the best way to smuggle drugs is through the yemeni coastline because it is 2000 kilometers long
7158245 therefore it is extremely difficult for us to overtake it not only that but the smugglers use highly developed techniques to achieve their goals and work with some of their gangs along the coast

7158248 we can not let this harmful practice takes more toll on the health and development of girls and women and ready to accelerate the abandonment of fgm c in a generation
7158249 the customs authority is one of the most important agencies that should play a key role in designing and establishing any national strategy meant to fight smuggling

7158260 i am truly grateful for the overwhelming support for our cause in achieving justice for yemeni websites in their struggle with the yemeni authorities
7158261 we risk intimidation harassment and in fact losing the case due to a biased judiciary yet it is a challenge worth taking as it will reflect this issue more prominently in the mainstream media and highlight our struggle for justice
7158262 the project fish planting would enhance in supporting yemeni exports to japanese markets for yemeni fisheries quality
7158263 we will provide all support to yemen for promoting and enhancing local authorities in yemen
7158264 the floods have damaged valleys and agricultural fields in the area and cut the road leading to al ahad market
7158265 i just do not understand why this war in saada and now a couple of other governorates cant seem to find an end to itself
7158266 wars can never find their own ends it is people who must reach the end of wars for all they care wars wouldnt mind it if they last for hundreds of years as long as these sons of adam relish at the sight of the blood of their own kin in fact wars think they are an end in themselves as they are the terminal point of reason logic and sheer human compassion
7158267 that is technology for you now how can i open this can without the ring
7158268 you cant find a can opener now anywhere in the city of sanaa thanks to all these self opening paraphernalia that has overtaken the canned and bottled drink industry
7158269 well at least you can thank wars for having no need for can and bottle openers anymore even corked bottles can now be opened without a cork screw opener and it is all because of those geniuses who make all the war gadgetry we see being lobbed between two confronting forces on tv now almost daily
7158270 brother you always seem to make a lengthy discourse out of simple questions that just happen to dance at the tip of my tongue from time to time what are you trying to get at
7158271 you see when you want to detonate a grenade dont you have to pull out a lever or unscrew something before throwing it at the enemy
7158272 how would i know i never threw a grenade at anybody and i hope i never see one let alone throw one
7158273 now you are not thinking like a real bona fide fighting yemeni why to yemenis war is their national pastime just read a little bit of the history of yemen it has been just an ongoing series of wars and skirmishes some of them localized while others saw armies moving from one side of the country to the next in blitzkrieg fashion some wars had foreigners embroiled in bloody engagements as punishment meted out by some rulers to their military brass for not fighting well on the other fronts to which their rulers had sent them some wars had foreigners who were misled by their naivet in thinking that yemen was an easy playground for their generals to play war games in only to find out with much disdain at the stupidity of their strategists and the military tacticians who goaded them to okay turning the war game button on whatever the case may be the yemenis were ready willing and simply proud to turn their country into a sustainable open grave for anyone who dares challenge their mastery over those rocks
7158274 yeah but where does the war in saada and now elsewhere fit in what you say
7158275 then there are those wars that our local war lords and war merchants foster to further their own selfish narrow interests these wars are the tragedy of the fighting spirit of yemen whenever there is hope that yemen just might enter into a period of stability and prosperity these war goons as i call them all of a sudden join forces to convince the authorities that the yemenis are getting bored for not having a war to fight in either here or elsewhere moreover it is really time to make use of our stashed weapons before they rust or get eaten by the rats like they ate the mareb dam
7158276 in addition we have neighbors who are drowned in wealth and have a hobby for fostering conflict wherever their money can find solid grounds for getting people to lob grenades and other ordnances at each other or just kill for the hell of it yemen lebanon and afghanistan are all fertile grounds for these war games of the rich they really believe that this will encourage the producers of the weapons used in all these wars to not bother them while they continue to indulge in an extravagance of blood which the unholy jihadist culture they have nurtured have spread throughout the world yemen is just a small piece of this jigsaw puzzle that has spread throughout the world
7158277 maybe that is why the red cross has turned a blind eye to the unfortunate tragic suffering of the innocent civilians of saada this includes ignoring the obliterated sculls of the yet unable to stand up infants who havent the faintest idea why they should pay the price for the follies of the grown men that lead their country an even more tragic picture is that even though the rc and the whole world has seen genuine photographed proof of the tragic outcome of war on the helpless civilians in saada not one voice of substance has been heard to call for an end to this madness unfolding in the distant and blockaded to the outside world region of saada one can recall a time when the red cross had a field hospital in a previous war in the very same war torn region that is witnessing the tragic consequences of irresponsible leadership today indeed that was a commendable task then now the icrc seems to find itself a prisoner of a red crescent society that obviously sees eye to eye with one of the antagonists in this regrettably meaningless prohibitive conflict
7158278 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7158279 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7158280 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7158281 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7158282 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7158283 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7158284 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7158285 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7158286 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7158287 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7158288 last week i had the honour of globally launching trump international hotel amp tower dubai currently being built on palm jumeirah with the trump organizations continued growth throughout the middle east we thought it was only fitting to bring sales of our unique trump soho penthouses to the uae our penthouses are the most desirable places to stay in new york city and will provide one of the most luxurious hotel experiences available anywhere in the world
7158289 there is a great desire among sophisticated arabic buyers to invest in manhattan as they have already a strong participation in the real estate markets of london and other capitals in europe they want to consolidate their presence around the world by incorporating new york to their portfolio
7158290 no one would deny that there have been some challenges to overcome in the first year but were looking forward to next year in a new building with better infrastructure an auditorium and a gymnasium students can utilize more than once a week
7158291 id like to thank all of our community partners for their commitment to kgia and we look forward to having them more directly involved as the school continues to grow thanks to our partners students have been exposed to drama and theater workshops middle eastern music creative writing and trips to the brooklyn museum
7158292 our members and our country chapters are the strong foundation for the successful outreach and implementation of all of yals goals programs and initiatives the yal membership base is expanding gradually with the number of chapters increasing consistently we are committed to bringing international best practices strengthening our governance framework a systematic implementation of our programs throughout our region and thus need to provide support to our chapters this first yal elections of 2008 mark a new milestone in yals progress
7158293 we are witnessing immense economic growth in the region and we have to ensure that this growth is sustainable and benefits the entire region we can achieve this only by enabling and empowering the one solid link that we have with our future the young people in our region
7158294 the first yal elections demonstrate yals pledge to the implementation and execution of principles and policies to strengthen the organization from within the 2008 elections are a step to ensure that all yal members have a voice in the decision making shaping of future strategies and designs of the various programs of our organization the introduction of the election process is an affirmation of our commitment to continue to enhance the sustainability of our country chapters and making sure that they are progressing to translate yals vision and mandate throughout the region
7158295 foreign policy can not be separated from the moral principles in which the majority of americans are involved we can not ignore the style via which the other governments treat their citizens
7158296 yemens crisis has presently become more complicated it will not be resolved individually and the government should have tackled it before it worsens
7158297 they dont agree with each other so they lose out on participation in arab and international competitions and exhibits
7158298 worldwide publications use photos as essential elements of their news but we still use the camera randomly ignoring many of its features
7158299 photographers could join together to form a club or a photographers syndicate where they could exchange ideas establish standards help one another in commissioned work hold group exhibits or classes for learning photography
7158300 the current standard of photography in yemen isnt what were looking for
7158301 training is very important for us because it helps refresh our photography skills and knowledge
7158302 learning participating in exhibits and competitions and analyzing the works of other successful photographers are all effective ways to improve a photographers skills
7158303 i have a staff of skilled photographers and their approximate monthly salaries range from yr 30 000 to 60 000 approximately 150 to 300
7158304 we now have commercial photography which we can see examples of on the large billboards that cant be missed while walking or driving along hadda street
7158305 we strongly believe that most rural households in yemen could be safely supplied out of an integrated rain water harvesting concept which is supported by all partners
7158306 if we want to implement a sustainable water management concept iwrm also has to focus on domestic water supply
7158307 it will be good if these filters reach poor families in rural areas where clean drinking water is hard to get
7158308 so far only the red cross bought 1 000 filters in order to give it to saada four months ago also we donated about 200 filters to mahwit and some to socotra island
7158309 we hope that the gtz and the private sector will take on this responsibility and that whoever starts selling these filters will not increase their price they are for poor people in rural areas and the goal of these filters is to provide clean drinking water for them
7158310 we never have a chance to do practical lessons because our study is mainly theoretical
7158311 when i joined the department i thought my study would be practical in terms of wording news items and follow up reports but some courses have no textbooks and depend only on lecture
7158312 there are no benefits apart from memorizing important figures in developing information concepts even top ranked students cant properly phrase a news item unless theyre correspondents for a newspaper
7158313 i suggest enhancing its practical work updating the curriculum and making it a separate college
7158314 comes out with her harmonious height and her decorated cloth opened from below showing her legs that are reddish as a sign of good health
7158315 i was just at the yemeni consulate three days ago
7158316 i was at the saudi consulate yesterday they know us there and theyre cool guys
7158317 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7158318 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7158319 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7158320 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7158321 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7158322 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7158323 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7158324 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7158325 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7158326 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7158327 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7158328 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7158329 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7158330 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7158331 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7158332 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7158333 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7158334 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7158335 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7158336 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7158337 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7158338 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7158339 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7158340 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7158341 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7158342 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7158343 based upon my review and the need for public confidence in new orleans flood protection system i have concluded that an outside opinion is warranted
7158344 we will work closely with these independent reviewers to ensure that all issues are dealt with comprehensively and expeditiously and we are quite confident that when all is said and done the end result will be the same as the previous investigations and audits
7158345 implies that operator error was responsible for the mammoth hydraulic pump failures
7158346 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and catastrophic failures of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job
7158347 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
7158348 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7158349 hope youre all having a wonderful summer this is actually the first summer where i didnt just lounge around in st tropez or a private beach somewhere i didnt take a vacation this summer because its been non stop work
7158350 ive been shooting the show editing it traveling to europe to promote my handbag line and fragrance designing my fall collection for my shoes and clothing line and working in my studio on a new album so professionally its been a very successful and productive summer my favorite part of the summer has been the time ive gotten to spend on tour with my love benj we always have the best time together and hes played some shows in some pretty rad places orlando for example so we got to go to disney world which is always a blast hes such an amazing boyfriend and so talented too i love watching him perform on stage so hot loves it
7158351 life couldnt be better i have a great boyfriend and a new best friend im so excited to announce that ive wrapped taping of paris hiltons my new bff ive been loving every moment in the editing room and am sitting there literally in tears every day laughing so hard at all the priceless moments from the footage also im thinking that a lot of the crazier scenes might just end up on the dvd there is so much footage and even though some will be edited out as all shows must do i want you to be able to see it and laugh as much as i have been
7158352 we have been spreading the load and that has been pretty evident in the last three weeks
7158353 i dont know how far we are going to go and how we are going to go next week but the more we play this group together the better we are going to get
7158354 he has a bruised calf we have a six day break touch and go i suppose

7158359 we having flooding issues in the county right now and the yankeetown and inglis area get it historically because of the drainage pattern in levy county where god wants the water to go out to the gulf of mexico
7158360 we are moving assets to inglis area to make sure we meet the needs
7158361 i havent heard of anybody being flooded out of their homes yet their yards are flooded and their septic systems are going down
7158362 the recovery centers are a place where people can go for water or just to get in some air conditioning and to get some information
7158363 the rain has tapered off some of the roads got wet very quickly and were treacherous to drive down
7158364 we had some branches down but none caused any damage
7158365 sunday is still going to be overcast with a few breaks as our friend fay slowly gets out shes a very unwelcome guest
7158366 as we start getting into tuesday we are looking at more climatological weather with partly cloudy skies and afternoon thundershowers
7158367 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7158390 approving payment to giordano of 900 000 would in essence give he and his children back the money he stole from hud
7158391 giordanos asserted administrative claim comes across as an insiders grab for the 900 000 closing payment to the detriment of actual creditors of the estate and in particular the united states
7158392 shall not be reduced by any administrative fees and expenses
7158393 the irs intends to levy on adler pollock amp sheehan immediately after the disbursement of funds at closing and subsequently as necessary to collect the entire 300 000 payable to
7158394 the governments concern was in preserving the right to pursue unpaid taxes and also preventing parties from unduly benefiting
7158395 the government wants to keep all of its legitimate options open to make the taxpayers whole the options include giordano or other parties to which giordanos money may have gone which is not to say what the ultimate outcome will be
7158396 certainly keeping it open and operating efficiently is a worthwhile objective for all parties
7158397 it means it saves a local senior care facility in woonsocket which is obviously a community that has experienced economic challenges
7158398 it avoids closure of the facility and avoids disrupting 150 residents
7158399 the importance of that is its not being paid from state proceeds
7158400 its being paid from one private party to the others counsel to extinguish a potential lawsuit and it remains subject to any claims of the irs
7158401 the intent always was to try to settle mr giordanos alleged irs obligation not to take cash out of the project
7158402 the intent was to persuade the irs theyd be better off taking the 900 000 as an offer in compromise on his entire irs obligation
7158403 if we got the money at least thats something to pay the irs if we didnt get it then that would provoke the irs to pay attention
7158404 i mean im skating through the practices like theyre nothing
7158405 you want to keep both of them motivated and competing
7158406 i think im going to need to get tackled a couple times
7158407 carys got a real nice harness on there right now and a bullet proof vest

7158463 the democratic party has chosen their nominee who reflects the issues and values of the party
7158464 sen obama offers a clear contrast with the republican nominee and i think sen biden complements him well
7158465 sen biden has repeatedly expressed his deep lack of faith in sen obamas experience
7158466 lets just say that now obama has some adult supervision in the form of joe biden

7158477 teachers must balance issues of fluency and accuracy depending on the specific needs of learners and the resources of time and materials for instruction
7158478 learners need opportunities to process language for communicative purposes as receivers and producers these opportunities should be unfettered by the perceived need to conform to teacher expectations in terms of the production of specific language forms
7158479 whenever learners are involved in communication they are concerned with accuracy in that they are making the best use of their language system to meet the communicative demands placed upon it in spontaneous communication learners have little time to reflect on the langue they produce if however they are given time to prepare what they have to produce then there will be a concern for formal accuracy within a communicative context

7158484 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers

7158502 mansfield was pivotal in getting senator biden elected back when senator biden was only 29 and as you know in the u s constitution its required that youre 30 years old so mansfield really helped biden out early on to get his career started so theres a little bit of a connection there

7158522 were scheduled to begin construction in six months your temporary setback could cost us fifty million dollars in interest payments alone
7158523 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7158524 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7158525 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7158526 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7158527 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7158528 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7158529 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7158530 who are open to doing something on the production side
7158531 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7158532 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7158533 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7158534 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7158535 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7158536 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7158537 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7158538 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7158539 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7158540 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7158541 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7158542 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7158543 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7158544 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7158545 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7158546 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7158547 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7158548 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7158549 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7158550 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7158551 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7158552 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7158553 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7158554 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7158555 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7158556 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7158557 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7158558 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7158559 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7158560 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7158561 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7158562 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7158563 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7158564 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7158565 we continue to underline to the chinese government the need to respect its commitment to freedom of expression
7158566 i hate it but we have paid for it so we have to use it for several years minimum
7158567 i cant wait to get rid of it as soon as my boss will agree
7158568 it falls over regularly when linking to our core enterprise content management system and we have to wait for several days before they fix it after a few months the suppliers interest in supporting us has much reduced
7158569 to be attached to the subdivision to love the little platoon we belong to in society is the first principle the germ as it were of public affections it is the first link in the series by which we proceed towards a love to our country and to mankind
7158570 peculiar to christs sacrifice are the infinite value of victim which give the sacrifice an infinite value of expiation and as merit
7158571 we dont pray on this program much but for this we might offer a prayer please let the democrats listen to bob shrum
7158572 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7158573 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7158574 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7158575 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7158576 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7158577 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7158578 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7158579 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7158580 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7158581 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7158582 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7158583 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7158584 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7158585 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7158586 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7158587 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7158588 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7158589 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7158590 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7158591 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7158592 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7158593 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7158596 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7158597 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7158598 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7158599 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7158600 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7158601 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7158602 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7158603 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7158604 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7158605 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7158606 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
7158607 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
7158608 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it

7158611 we are more visual learners we use different technologies to express ourselves we dont use just pen and paper
7158612 99 of the teachers do it the old fashioned way of sit down you listen to someone lecture for 40 50 minutes
7158613 there are several options in expressing yourself and expressing your viewpoints and i think the university limits that
7158614 i was given one way and that was how i had to do it
7158615 the professor still wants to teach it the same way they learned
7158616 i figured id have to to write papers i figured id have to do problem sets but i thought there would be more options
7158617 it is frustrating because it doesnt seems that college is accommodating the visual learner
7158618 anywhere you go outside of the classroom the technology is being used i dont understand why we arent applying it to class
7158619 i think it would make it more exciting for them
7158620 when i become a teacher i am going to have to learn and assess that students are going to have even more that is accessible to them and if i dont adapt to that im going to start to lose my

7158636 we were impressed by deskspaces wholistic approach they were not just concerned with the management accounting side the desired outcomes that i had identified as my key requirement as the manager of this post production sound unit at the studios they were concerned to understand how the guys in the editing suites and mixing theatres worked and to work out what would work best for them so that they also got what they wanted i was impressed by deskspaces ability to analysis our business needs and that they understood that we as managers do not necessarily have the ability to describe what we actually need they had the ability to work it out and show us what in fact we actually needed and they were right
7158637 deskspace delivered what they said they would deliver within the time frame that we agreed at the cost we had agreed and we are very pleased with the result
7158638 deskspace delivered the agreed system on budget amp on time
7158639 we were all excited until we went to go for the money and learned that we are not entitled to it we are very saddened by the news
7158640 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7158641 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7158642 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7158643 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7158644 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7158645 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7158646 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7158647 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7158648 where are you god i really need you now please dont leave me now please help me
7158649 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7158650 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7158651 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7158652 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7158653 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7158654 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7158655 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7158656 chinese netizens have their own standards of beauty when it comes to black americans
7158657 chinese and black people seem to occupy two ends of the aesthetic spectrum having reached china via middlemen like white americans and korean singers many trends that began with blacks such as hip hop lose much of their authenticity in the process and then its somewhat jarring to see a chinese youth with softly toned skin and smaller features dressed in xxl sized clothing with the striking colors that so naturally compliment black teenagers

7158689 i never said that allahs treasures are in my hand that i knew the hidden things that i was an angel i am only a messanger of gods words
7158690 god is he than whom there is no other deity he knows the unseen and the evident he is the merciful the mercy giving god is he than whom there is no other deity the sovereign the holy one the source of peace the guardian of faith the preserver of safety the mighty the irresistible the supreme glory be to god high is he above the partners they attribute to him he is god the creator the evolver the bestower of forms to him belong the most beautiful names whatever is in the heaven and on earth glorifies him and he is the mighty the wise
7158691 if any one sins he she alone is responsible for his her sin
7158692 what god grants to men out of his mercy no one can withhold and what he withholds no one can grant apart from him
7158693 when you ask anything ask it from god and if you seek help seek help in god know that if the people were to unite to do you some benefit they could benefit you only what god has recorded for you and if they were to unite to do you some injury they could injure you only what god has recorded for you

7158695 the aryan settlers were a pastoral and agricultural people and they were keenly alive to those influences which affected their prosperity and comfort
7158696 its chief mark consists in concentration on the spiritual aspect belief in the intimate relationship of philosophy and life the inseparability of theory and practice and the insistence on intuition coexisting with the acceptance of authority
7158697 he brought intact the religion of jesus in the vehicle of a religion about jesus
7158698 christianity is not a way of looking into the past but a way of going forward into the future not an escape from the world into solitariness but a way of spending ones life in order to find it not a retreat into ultimate truth but a redemptive mission a way of salvation leading into the world and through the world in the love of god and man

7158701 travelers laptops may be detained at border no suspicion required under dhs policies
7158702 i make payments and if i die my family collects millions
7158703 halal and highly encouraged and that we should teach our children to study it and master it
7158704 unlike saudi in us who i think has an amazing ability to perceive things in the most negative way i think that fatwas are issued in a hasty manner
7158705 im not muslim can i practice my faith in saudi arabia
7158706 turn the pagans out of the arabian peninsula respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with them
7158707 i forgot it see hadith no 116 vol 1 sahih al bukhari
7158708 the people of the book used to read the torah in hebrew and then explain it in arabic to the muslims
7158709 i have no interest in the likes of christan evangelists trying to convince others that if they do not believe in jesus as the son of god im going to hellfire or whatever other angle they come up with this is where the problem will come forth this is the very reason the government is not letting non muslims openly practice their faiths
7158710 22 40 those who have been expelled from their homes without a just cause except that they say our lord is allah and had there not been allahs repelling some people by others certainly there would have been pulled down cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques in which allahs name is much remembered and surely allah will help him who helps his cause most surely allah is strong mighty
7158711 besides which if that is the case muslims in the west need to stop whining they are in christian countries
7158712 which western country is christian apart from south american where there isnt a sizable muslim population anyway
7158713 chapter 1 article 1 the kingdom of saudi arabia is a sovereign arab islamic state with islam as its religion gods book and the sunnah of his prophet gods prayers and peace be upon him are its constitution arabic is its language and riyadh is its capital
7158714 now what is considered progressive correct equal etc by standards set by man in different parts of the world are irrelevant when dealing with a nation that dominantly believes in islam
7158715 after the clear evidence of islaam has come you want that the saudi government should promote kufr and shirk by allowing it to be spread in the land
7158716 so my question to you is where are the existing churches and synagogues in saudia for them to be pulled down
7158717 let the satanists and magicians open their temples and churches
7158718 when are we going to open bars for the alcoholics its their rights
7158719 im not muslim can i practice my faith in saudi arabia
7158720 jews christians and polytheists should be expelled out of arabia
7158721 your ignorance of history and the quran is what is the problem here

7158726 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7158727 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything

7158730 the reason i give you this brief background is in america it doesnt matter
7158731 in america anyone can make it we live in a great country theres opportunity for everyone
7158732 we need to have elections that are full of issues quit the negative campaigning and once we get through the election put partisan politics aside
7158733 ive been through the changes some good some not so good

7158747 i cant believe i wasted countless hours out of my life building a playlist that dizzler ended up deleting when they abruptly and without warning reverted back to a previously saved playlist from a couple months previous and then dizzler has not even had the common courtesy to send me an email explaining what the hell happened to my playlist that i spent countless hours working on i had five hundred songs on my playlist and i dont have any way of remembering what all of them were dizzler sucks i hope all of you employees at dizzler com get hit with some bad luck of your own thats how pissed off i am that you guys dont even have the common courtesy to send me an email explaining what the hell happened to the five hundred songs that i spent time adding to my internet playlist on dizzler com you guys just really dont give a crap do you you know what i think im going to post this email on my blog so all of the world can see how pissed off i am at dizzler com
7158748 you know this opposing viewpoints guy could have chosen a better way to say these things but if you think about what he is trying to say it actually makes a lot of sense there is actually a small amount of very intelligent logic hiding behind his unpolished presentation

7158782 they said traffic was being stopped and then they came up with we cant have a roadside stand and then they said it was a commercial enterprise
7158783 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they grow it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next

7158791 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7158792 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7158793 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7158794 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7158795 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging

7158801 every time weve asked st paul to come and assist us with their bomb squad or the hugo tornado incident theyre always more than willing to send people and resources
7158802 this is a regional event in terms of law enforcement security
7158803 dakota county butts up to the city of st paul so we feel like we want to be a good and active partner during the rnc
7158804 we have a great responsibility in assisting with the details up at the rnc
7158805 plus we have to be prepared should anything happen within dakota county thats rnc related that we have an adequate response
7158806 we had to do some creative scheduling because we dont want this initiative to be shouldered by the good people of eagan
7158807 we have 18 officers who have volunteered to work off duty so it will not impact our service levels for on duty staffing
7158808 were just doing what we can to help the st paul police man a little corner of the city
7158809 we are excited to bring the funky boutique concept to the oregon coast and infuse it with the same friendly and highly personalized service we offer at farmers daughter
7158810 we want a stay at surftides to both inspire and recharge our guests while giving them a multifaceted experience that cant be found elsewhere on the coast
7158811 silence is the language of god all else is poor translation

7158814 we shouldnt be spending more for land than our experts say its worth
7158815 fred purcell never wanted to be the poster boy for property rights
7158816 but he was gracious enough to let us try this case he was the perfect example of what was going on with landowners around the country
7158817 it would have been a disaster for preserving our plant and animals species
7158818 and then the county bought it because no one else could use it
7158819 i think he had an extreme version of private property rights that obviously clashed with the law and the public interest
7158820 i think purcell is right when he feels theres a potential conflict of interest
7158821 and weve already got several much larger purchases already in the works
7158822 a bird without a nest calls the world its home
7158823 i m now allowed to like it or unlike it but your coverage is very impressive
7158824 when you force and expect everyone to accept the gay agenda you are actually being intolerant of the viewpoints of others
7158825 i just don t want their culture being shoved down my throat by mtv and other media outlets
7158826 your basic argument is that not allowing you to persecute people translates to persecuting you
7158827 yes and i don t want you re red neck trailer trash nascar culture being forced down my throat by fox and other media outlets thats what remotes are for
7158828 i am a big big girl in a big big world
7158829 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7158830 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7158831 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7158832 i told him if hes going to compete hes going to have days like this
7158833 its not the last time its going to happen to him in his life its a good learning experience
7158834 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7158835 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7158836 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7158837 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7158838 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7158839 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7158840 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7158841 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7158842 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7158843 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7158844 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7158845 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7158846 monday and tuesday next week we will be holding dialogues with local officials bishops and ulamas and different people in the areas affected so that we can take a closer look at the situation and try to see what is the best way of restoring normalcy to the life of everyone there
7158847 if they truly want the peace process to continue under the process of law they themselves invoke we expect them fully to cooperate with our systems of justice
7158848 many people thought these boats will make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of brining in goods equipment food and medicine
7158849 however once it turned out these boats contain too little food and mostly activists some people left the beach disappointed
7158850 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7158851 the race was definitely different from any other in my career
7158852 i had more thoughts go through my head in that race than ever before
7158853 when i turned at the 50 meter mark and saw how far ahead he was for a few seconds i thought this is impossible then i felt myself catching him and i changed my mindset with about 15 meters to go i realized he was fading and i got a surge of adrenaline like ive never felt in my life it was really difficult to tell if i had outtouched bernard but with everyones reaction it was obvious we had won
7158854 me and my family are really big fans of swimming so we were jumping up and down on the couch as lezak started to come from behind
7158855 i was more nervous for lezak because i had met him
7158856 just as in the case with the other relay i didnt go into it worrying about michael
7158857 i went into it trying to win the gold medal as a team of four and as a part of team usa it was a great way to end the olympics
7158858 it was really cool that he was able to be in the pool with us at the time because even then he was a very popular swimmer
7158859 he taught me how valuable foot turns are off the wall and how you need to keep up a fast tempo
7158860 when he talked to us at the banquet he was about 32 years old and still hadnt medaled in an individual event
7158861 so what he preached to us was even if you dont accomplish your dreams at an early age dont give up i was so happy for him when his goals were accomplished
7158862 labor camps their fellow believers were high on these but my position would be that most of them have lived their lives at or near the public trough so after their own beliefs their life should continue only as long as they can support themselves in the camps
7158863 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7158864 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world
7158865 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7158866 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7158867 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7158868 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7158869 el lineamiento se trata de construir en serio nuestro modelo socialista que est obligado a luchar contra el latifundio acabar con los monopolios privados vamos pues pueblo de cabimas a construir el socialismo

7158876 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that

7158886 biden ha denunciado el pobre juicio de obama en pol tica internacional y ha alegado en sus propias palabras lo que los estadounidense han comenzado a comprender que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7158887 the copy of the press release is not only anti woman but also unethical one would have called it unethical even if the person targeted was a man and not a woman did it ever strike the committee of three women officers and the r amp aw that projecting her in public as a mental case would tend to damage her image not only in the eyes of the public and her colleagues but also in the eyes of her children and other members of her family
7158888 how would the hearts of nishas children and other relatives bleed when they find her being described in the manner she has been in the press release
7158889 one understands that there were ups and downs in nishas personal life in the late 1990s which did cast a shadow on her career despite this she maintained her composure and was given an important foreign posting
7158890 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small

7158899 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7158900 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7158901 has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7158902 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7158903 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7158904 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7158905 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7158906 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7158907 i love playing for toronto its a great opportunity to play and test myself in scotland but at the same time it hurts to leave the team right now
7158908 we know of no good reason why aging should happen
7158909 next to the miracle of life itself aging and death are perhaps the greatest mysteries
7158910 non aging is what is normal its aging that baffles science
7158911 death is the way the world gets rid of unhealthy people
7158912 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7158913 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7158914 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7158915 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7158916 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7158917 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7158918 this is our chance to give a little back to the community with donations and to show them what we do and just to get together and have a good time
7158919 shes been putting the finishing touches to some of the dance routines today in a good way shes a perfectionist

7158940 big box retailers and superstores may negatively impact the labor market in an area by the conversion of higher paying retail jobs to a fewer number of lower paying retail jobs the difference in overall compensation wages and benefits may be as much as 8 00
7158941 lack of health care benefits of many big box and superstore employees can result in a greater public financial burden as workers utilize emergency rooms as a major component of their health care
7158942 a study conducted by the san diego taxpayers association sdcta a nonprofit nonpartisan organization found that an influx of big box stores into san diego would result in an annual decline in wages and benefits between 105 million and 221 million and an increase of 9 million in public health costs sdcta also estimated that the region would lose pensions and retirement benefits valued between 89 million and 170 million per year and that even increased sales and property tax revenues would not cover the extra costs of necessary public services
7158943 the threat of incursion into the southern california grocery market is already triggering a dynamic in which the grocery stores are negotiating with workers for lowered compensation in an attempt to re level the playing field
7158944 one study of superstores and their potential impact on grocery industry employees found that the entry of such stores into the southern california regional grocery business was expected to depress industry wages and benefits at an estimated range from a low of 500 million to a high of almost 1
7158945 this pattern of earnings growth suggests that while the economy is expanding the benefits of growth are flowing to those at the top of the wage scale
7158946 as capital scours the globe for cheaper and more malleable workers and as poor countries seek multinational companies to provide jobs lift production and open export markets wal mart and china have forged themselves into the ultimate joint venture their symbiosis influencing the terms of labor and consumption the world over
7158947 wal mart pressures the factory to cut its price and the factory responds with longer hours or lower pay
7158948 often prepare by cleaning up creating fake time sheets and briefing workers on what to say
7158949 in the beginning we made money but when wal mart started to launch nationwide distribution they pressured us for a special price below our cost
7158950 the explanation for the apparent contradiction may be that the governments desire for foreign investment and jobs trumps any concern for workers rights
7158951 may opt to spend their savings on sports equipment continuing education classes or restaurant meals
7158952 you keep people making 10 an hour to a high standard
7158953 basically i was thrown out like a piece of trash
7158954 it is ludicrous and contrary to our business model to think the company would benefit from replacing experienced associates with new lower paid ones

7159023 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7159024 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7159025 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7159026 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7159027 the enterprise architect is really more focused on trying to bring the organization together around a business strategy or mission and certainly they understand the tooling and how to translate the mission vision and strategy into an soa architecture
7159028 what we are really looking for are people who can then move into the business space who have a lot more of the softer skills things like influencing

7159031 in january the then culture secretary categorically promised the commons there would be no more lottery raids to pay for their olympics budget miscalculations
7159032 six months later that promise has been torn up every time the lottery is raided less money goes into grassroots sport yet this is the only way we will secure a legacy for everyone from the 2012 olympics
7159033 funding for our athletes in athens was primarily lottery money in beijing both lottery and exchequer
7159034 for london the package will be lottery exchequer and business
7159035 following our successes in beijing we have great ambitions for our athletes in 2012 and are determined to make sure that investment is in place
7159036 can gordon brown not see there is something fundamentally short sighted in funding the british team by raiding the money going to local and community sports clubs
7159037 if the government had started raising this money earlier our athletes could have had the funding certainty they need without raiding grassroots sports

7159040 it was a total shock and one of two things happened
7159041 either it was misdiagnosed or gene knew what was going on and didnt want to upset the league didnt want to upset the players didnt want to do anything to be a distraction but thats the kind of man that gene upshaw was
7159042 stability is one word to describe upshaw but also experience
7159043 he was a guy that had been there done that as a player as a rep as an ex player as a union official being in the backrooms when deals were done and deals were cut he was doing the right thing for the players at the right time although a lot of players disagreed with that but he did what was for the best for the masses
7159044 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7159045 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7159046 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7159047 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium

7159066 i consider that a mans brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stack it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work

7159082 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7159083 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7159084 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7159085 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7159086 creating and submitting a sitemap helps make sure that google knows about all the pages on your site including urls that may not be discoverable by googles normal crawling process sitemaps are particularly helpful if your site has dynamic content your site has pages that arent easily discovered by googlebot during the crawl process for example pages featuring rich ajax or flash your site is new and has few links to it googlebot crawls the web by following links from one page to another so if your site isnt well linked it may be hard for us to discover it your site has a large archive of content pages that are not well linked to each other or are not linked at all you can also use a sitemap to provide google with additional information about your pages including how often the pages on your site change for example you might update your product page daily but update your about me page only once every few months the date each page was last modified the relative importance of pages on your site for example your home page might have a relative importance of 1 0 category pages have an importance of 0 8 and individual blog entries or product pages have an importance of 0 5 this priority only indicates the importance of a particular url relative to other urls on your site and doesnt impact the ranking of your pages in search results
7159087 provide google with a simple text file that contains one url per line for example www example com file1 html www example com file2 html for best results follow these guidelines you must fully specify urls as google attempts to crawl them exactly as provided each text file can contain a maximum of 50 000 urls if you site includes more than 50 000 urls you can separate the list into multiple text files and add each one separately the text file must use utf 8 encoding you can specify this when you save the file for instance in notepad this is listed in the encoding menu of the save as dialog box the text file should contain no information other than the list of urls the text file should contain no header or footer information you can name the text file anything you wish google recommends giving the file a txt extension to identify it as a text file for instance sitemap txt you should upload the text file to your server generally to the highest level directory you want search engines to crawl

7159100 o my gosh shes exploring same sex attractions she must be a lesbian
7159101 girls making out with each other to turn on guys is the latest craze at high school and college parties
7159102 and the kissing itself didnt really bug me from then on it became a normal thing to do
7159103 youre turning on a guy and he thinks its cool
7159104 the term for the im straight but ill kiss girls mentality is heteroflexible
7159105 theyre doing it because they want to appeal to boys their age and for boys their age whove developed sexually alongside internet porn their sexual cues are affected by the norms and standards of porn and thats girl on girl action
7159106 the joint has been infiltrated by a gaggle of giggling straight girls playing gay for a night because it amuses them
7159107 difficult to distinguish between the behavior of someone who is legitimately sexually interested and someone who wants to impress the boy across the room
7159108 a lot of girls who do want long term boyfriends will still settle for the hookup triggered by girl on girl kissing because it gives them that temporary feeling of being taken care of and being close to someone
7159109 who are you what are you writing why are you here
7159110 theres been a lot of apathy on campus in the past but obama really inspires everyone i know on campus
7159111 he wont be just our parents president he will be our president
7159112 in fact this is my first time voting i think well finally see a real change with him
7159113 he doesnt talk over your head or use big words he has a sense of humor he doesnt just talk to the ones who went to school
7159114 biden is a very smart choice he knows the political game and he has experience were in big trouble in this country and we need somebody to take it in a new direction
7159115 in depth persuasion is the only way well win in wisconsin we need to grab all these people quickly before someone else does
7159116 our goal is for you to be learning how to tell your personal story of why you are called to serve in this campaign to enable you to motivate others
7159117 when youre doing persuasion its really important to view things from the voters perspective put on their eyeglasses
7159118 its a waste of your time to argue about hot button issues please dont do that your being right is not the goal the goal is to validate their feelings
7159119 people are more likely to listen to somebody from the same neighborhood
7159120 be humble and patient and respectful when doing persuasion calls
7159121 we need you to connect to people so they can feel more comfortable about who obama is
7159122 the best bet with smears is to confront it head on
7159123 dont try to argue just say these are the facts
7159124 so what if we bring up something like our candidate knows how many houses he has is that being negative
7159125 a lot of people dont know what an organizer is
7159126 you can say he helped people in chicago get jobs
7159127 when you finally get to meet with mabel in janesville if you didnt get a specific commitment
7159128 im sorry if we got off on the wrong foot
7159129 i wasnt trying to interrogate you i just wanted to help
7159130 this is as good a way to get a sense of whats in peoples minds as any experience
7159131 we believe if you want people to vote for you you have to go and ask them
7159132 your husband has about as much chance of winning as obama
7159133 i know you sat the last one out i want you phone banking man
7159134 id be for anybody who can beat norm coleman but i also like al
7159135 i think hed be great for us he reminds me of paul wellstone
7159136 couldnt stand the thought of losing that senate seat to norm coleman
7159137 my own personal experience is that his campaign is not resonating with minnesotans
7159138 if we had a quarter of a million id bet my lifes savings we could win this campaign i still think we can beat him
7159139 theres a high level of dissatisfaction with coleman and franken and im hearing that
7159140 they wanted a provocation at sea but they wont get it
7159141 we didnt have anybody famous it was old fashioned people power we just wanted to show what happens when ordinary people from around the world get together to try breaking this immoral siege on gaza

7159144 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence and work with the federation to 100 per cent clarify this situation and put this to rest

7159150 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7159151 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7159152 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7159153 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7159154 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time
7159155 sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on
7159156 not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7159157 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7159158 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7159159 hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7159160 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall

7159174 approval of autrys expansion plans at griffith park will not be forthcoming unless they partner with the community and live up to their commitments to mount washington
7159175 in a few months i expect to have more leverage regarding this issue the autry will have to come to the city for approval of its expansion plans and they will know that i am absolutely committed to this museum and to this historic site that is so important to this neighborhood and this city to the extent that the autry lives up to its commitments i believe they can be wonderful partners for the museum and for the community but they must live up to their commitments
7159176 we demand that the board of the autry national center make a firm and legally binding commitment to take responsibility for the continued maintenance and operation of the southwest museums mount washington facilities in perpetuity as a condition of being allowed to develop new facilities on lands owned by the city of los angeles in griffith park virtually free of charge and in recognition of the enormous investment of public funds invested in the construction of the gold lines southwest museum station further the autry national center must commit to a thorough programmatic study to determine how the casa de adobe the southwest museum and the braun library may continue to be operated in a manner consistent with its founders vision as a reflection of the cultural historical and artistic heritage of the southwest of california and of the city of los angeles having assumed possession of the southwest museums assets and priceless collection the autry national center must officially recognize its moral responsibility to maintain and revitalize the museums historic mount washington home so that it will play as integral role in the future cultural and economic development of los angeles northeast community as it has in its past

7159179 some domineering countries and their worthless followers want to get their own way with the iranian nation but the nation the president and the government have stood up to them

7159207 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue

7159302 ruilen hun vrouw in voor een jonger exemplaar of veranderen van baan sommige mannen gaan bergbeklimmen maar dat is duur en heel gevaarlijk de marathon is een soort poor mans k2 het kost vrijwel geen geld als je er serieus voor traint en niets mankeert moet het te doen zijn en je loopt niet het risico in een ravijn te sodemieteren zodat vrouw en kinderen je plotseling moeten missen
7159303 dat ik vroeger nooit erg sportief ben geweest af en toe een potje squashen met vrienden en dan een potje bier na afloop en in strenge winters een toertocht op natuurijs maar dat laatste mag ook steeds minder naam hebben door de klimaatverandering
7159304 hoe het zover is gekomen het is eigenlijk begonnen toen ik 7 jaar geleden de magische 40 jaar grens passeerde dan kom je op een leeftijd dat je een beetje moet gaan bewegen om niet elk jaar een kilo zwaarder te worden althans met mijn consumptie patroon zo ben ik terecht gekomen in de sportschool die gevestigd is in het olympisch stadion van amsterdam waar ik geleidelijk aan mn conditie heb vergroot op roei en andere apparaten en ook een beetje aan krachttraining ben gaan doen
7159305 ik was dus niet helemaal onvoorbereid toen mijn zwager freek b me vorig jaar overhaalde mee te doen aan de dam tot damloop amsterdam zaandam van 16 kilometer dat bleek zo leuk dat ik een maand later de halve maraton in amsterdam heb gelopen 2 08 in maart van dit jaar volgde mn tweede halve namelijk de city pier city loop in den haag 1 56 trainen helpt echt vervolgens heb ik besloten die hele marathon te gaan lopen
7159306 niet zo heel erg veel wel naar de wedstrijden van het nederlands elftal op het ek en naar de finale ook weleens naar holland sport van het onvolprezen duo de jong en van nieuwkerk en naar het voetbabbelprograma van jack van gelder ik houd erg van hugo borst de tour de france doet me niets heb ik helemaal niks mee eindeloos fietsen is echt iets heel anders dan eindeloos lopen en daar heb ik dan ook niks van gezien
7159307 ik ben dol op de nederlandse successen op excessen phelps en teleurgestelde trainers zoals de chinese coach die in tranen uitbarstte nadat zijn pupil en favoriet liu xiang met een blessure uitviel dat laatste is niet heel erg sportief maar het is niet anders
7159308 sport sport weg met de sport niets is goed waar je moe van wordt zongen ze op mijn school in amsterdam
7159309 ik was het daar hartgrondig mee eens kreeg het als kind ook nauwelijks mee mijn ouders zetten de tv gewoon uit als het voetbal begon
7159310 toegegeven ik was er niet goed in het klimrek kwam ik niet op de bok zelden overheen ronduit de pest had ik aan alle mogelijke balsporten vooral het vreselijke trefbal is me bijgebleven zo hard mogelijk een bal naar het hoofd van de andere ploeg gooien maar het wonder gebeurde alsnog ik bleek een schaatser een sterke zwemmer en wielrenner ik fietste moeiteloos naar de waddeneilanden en weer terug beukte over de ijsselmeerdijk
7159311 het fietsen had zijn boudewijn de groot gehalte kromgebogen over het stuur tegen de wind een overwinning op de elementen je peddelt stug verder of het nu waait regent of vriest alles wat er om je heen gebeurt is deel van de ervaring rij je langs de koeien dan ruik je koeien in het bos ruik je bomen de geur van koolzaad ik leg vaak aan spanjaarden uit dat we in nederland ook s winters fietsen daar snappen ze niks van
7159312 ik bracht mijn mountainbike naar madrid en vond het geweldig
7159313 de stad schrompelde in elkaar en alles leek dichtbij de praktijk bleek ook levensgevaarlijk dat kun je de automobilisten hier geeneens verwijten omdat er maar heel weinig mensen fietsen houden ze geen rekening met je je hebt daardoor op je fiets zon beetje iedere vijf minuten haast een ongeluk de lol verdwijnt en je krijgt er een nare spanning voor terug na het zoveelste bijna ongeval ben ik ermee gestopt en heb mijn fiets aan een onwetende fran aise verkocht
7159314 ik hou ook veel van de verhalen m de sport reportages bijvoorbeeld over nationalisme en voetbal vind ik razend interessant maar ook alleen al over de cultuur van de sport in baskenland kun je geweldige verhalen vertellen ik wil daar ook echt eens een kampioenschap boomhakken en stenentillen meemaken
7159315 waar ik naar luister en wat niet weg te branden is uit mijn cd speler
7159316 is spinvis ik werd een tijdje terug door een lokale radio in madrid ge nterviewd en mocht mijn favoriete muziek meenemen in de hele stad hebben ze toen ook van spinvis gehoord
7159317 ik ben coach van het f team van mijn voetballende dochter en ik probeer geen wedstrijd van mijn voetballende zoon te missen
7159318 de kleine kinderen die zo lekker speels zijn en een gewillig doelwit voor mijn fotolens
7159319 voetbalde ik en daarna speelde ik tennis nu doe ik niets meer de onregelmatigheid van een journalist maakt het onmogelijk in een teamsport te functioneren af en toe loop ik hard met zoon en of dochter ook al is de dochter pas 8 ze loopt me er soms al uit misschien toch eens wat aan de conditie gaan doen
7159320 sport beperkt zich bij mij tot hardlopen op mijn loopband
7159321 sinds een half jaar bezit ik die zelf en heb ik mijn abonnement op de sportschool opgezegd het voordeel van een loopband in eigen huis is dat ik heel economisch kan sporten ik hoef er de deur niet voor uit als ik een uurtje over heb ga ik naar mijn werkkamer en loop ik
7159322 ik doe dat gemiddeld tweemaal per week maar vind eigenlijk dat ik het om de dag zou moeten doen het is wel een beetje eenzijdig en daarom sluit ik niet uit dat ik over een paar maanden toch eenmaal per week naar de sportschool ga ik loop omdat het goed voor mijn conditie is niet voor mijn lol in het verleden heb ik zelf tafeltennis gespeeld en later badminton het is zo lastig om met onze wisselende werktijden te sporten dat het in clubverband geen optie is daarom ben ik naar de sportschool gegaan en dat heb ik een jaar of zes gedaan
7159323 ik krijg regelmatig uitnodigingen waar een dagje golf aan gekoppeld is dus ik denk dat het voor netwerken heel handig kan zijn bovendien is het in de buitenlucht ook niet onprettig
7159324 natuurlijk volg ik alle andere sporten ook vooral zoals nu op de olympische spelen maar voetbal heeft mijn voorkeur ik ben geen fan van een blokje zaalsport op de zondagmiddag met bijvoorbeeld handbal volleybal en waterpolo etc wielrennen volg ik vooral in de tour de france en in de winter schaatsen het contact met tennis heb ik een beetje verloren ik ben nog van de generatie connors en mcenroe toen bleef je voor een grandslam toernooi echt thuis dat is nu veel minder hoewel de rivaliteit tussen federer en nadal niet slecht is voor de tennissport
7159325 voor televisie vlucht ik regelmatig naar mijn werkkamer want de hoeveelheid sport die ik wil en moet zien kun je de rest van je gezin niet aandoen er is elke dag live sport via sport 1 en straks het eredivisiekanaal ook zenden wij zelf heel veel uit en ik vind dat ik die uitzendingen moet zien
7159326 ik ben liefhebber van goede speelfilms zie veel actualiteit en regelmatig pauw en witteman ik mis een goed muziekprogramma op de nederlandse televisie en houd van info kwissen als het mes op tafel per seconde wijzer en twee voor twaalf volg andere tijden hoewel ik de afleveringen een paar jaar geleden sterker vond en ben groot fan van keuringsdienst van waarde geweldige televisie
7159327 helaas tegenwoordig veel te weinig tijd voor of moet ik erkennen dat het 51 jarig lichaam minder luistert naar de jonge geest mijn leven lang ben ik een fanatieke sporter geweest gymnastiek tot mijn 12e voetballen tot mijn 17e om er maar een paar te noemen en toen begaf mijn knie het het advies was om te gaan fietsen racefiets gekocht en peddelen maar probleem is dat wanneer ik sport ik ook erg fanatiek ben lukt het me niet om met de besten mee te doen dan verlies ik heel snel interesse
7159328 badminton tennis hardlopen boksen tafeltennis basketbal je kan het zo gek niet bedenken toch voerde fietsen altijd de boventoon vijftien jaar lang gemiddeld 10 000 kilometer per jaar iedere buitenlandse reis ging het raceding mee weinig plaatsen waar ik niet heb gefietst soms levensgevaarlijk vooral in landen waar men nog bijna nooit een fiets heeft gezien word je als bezienswaardigheid bijna van de weg gereden
7159329 ik heb nog steeds een racefiets maar die wordt niet veel gebruikt komt dat fanatieke weer kan niet meer zo snel als vroeger en dat gaat de lol er snel af het verslaan van sport is tegenwoordig veel leuker australian open wereldbeker wielrennen op de baan wk zeilen foto in dit sportgekke land gebeurt wat dat betreft altijd wel iets
7159330 soms geloof ik het nog steeds aan mij is een sterke klimmer verloren gegaan
7159331 niet met touwen die breken toch maar af maar op de fiets kijkend naar mijn kuiten zag ik mij vrijwel zonder moeite een alpen of pyrenee n top bedwingen tandje erbij tandje eraf niemand die mij zou kunnen volgen maar gelukkig ik wielren niet dat doet aan de vrije gedachte uiteraard niets af ik bespeel helaas ook geen enkel muziekinstrument maar dat belet mij niet om mocht mij er om worden gevraagd zonder blozen te verklaren dat ik een virtuoos mondharpist ben of zou kunnen worden minstens toch dat
7159332 een van de weinige voor mij geloofwaardige opmerkingen van jan mulder de voetballer die na afloop van zijn loopbaan om nog steeds onopgehelderde redenen uit schrijven ging is dat sporten ongezond is
7159333 dat tracht ik mij dan ook zo veel mogelijk voor te houden al wil ik wel eens bezwijken voor een partijtje tennis
7159334 ook het kijken naar sport heeft op zich voor mij weinig belang het gaat niet om de sport zo is mijn stelregel het gaat om de beleving die ik als toeschouwer van die sport heb en dat dan niet in mijn eentje maar met andere toeschouwers liefst mensen die van de betreffende sport even weinig afweten als ik zoals van korfballen een van de mooiste sportwedstrijden die ik ooit heb gezien was de finale nederland belgi van een wereldkampioenschap korfballen wat het spelletje tussen de dames en heren zo boeiend maakte was het feit dat het zich afspeelde in een sportzaal in new delhi de onvolprezen hoofdstad van india
7159335 korfballen is in india al even populair als tempelbezoek in nederland de meeste indiase toeschouwers waren dan vooral ook op de wedstrijd afgekomen om hun nageslacht te kunnen verhalen hoe zij ooit op een zaterdag ergens aan het einde van de vorige eeuw in eigen stad en land nog eens iets zeer exotisch hadden meegemaakt dat alles zorgde voor een geweldige sfeer andere mannelijke kijkers waren er overigens meer op uit met eigen ogen te zien of o schandaal de vrouwelijke korfballers inderdaad onder hun rokjes enkel een panty droegen en geen strakke bermuda zoals de vrouwelijke leden van het indiase team iedereen zijn eigen sport
7159336 ja die in oostenrijk nog niet zo lang geleden met n andere nederlander was ik naar een kroeg hier in de keniaanse hoofdstad nairobi gegaan overal hingen tv schermen in ons gezelschap bevonden zich verder enkel kenianen zij waren net als ik niet zozeer uit op een overwinning van het een of andere team als wel op een vrolijke avond sommige van hen hadden zich weliswaar deels in het oranje gehesen maar belangrijker voor ons was toch het kunnen lachen joelen en oeiiiiii roepen opdat ook het bier vrijelijk kon stromen ik meen dat rusland won maar dat ben ik even kwijt het was een avond van vriendschap als sport op die manier verbroedert acht ik sport zeer gezond
7159337 en verder ben ik getrouwd met iemand die er haar hand niet voor omdraait om uren in de gym te zweten vele kilometers hard te lopen of mount kenya op te rennen als betrof het hier een warm uitgestoken hand in plaats van een ijzingwekkende berg ik moedig haar in dat alles zeer aan
7159338 i think j j was sensible to not just come here with nothing to show the fans
7159339 i think its just going to serve to make the anticipation greater
7159340 when he finally is ready to show something i mean ive seen a little bit and i was screaming i had my hand over my mouth oh my god its so good i just think its going to be huge
7159341 her family are from glasgow and scotty is from linlithgow which i think is in the northwest
7159342 if my face looks like your bum then it is very cute
7159343 if my face looked like your butt id kiss myself
7159344 oh man you have to check out these awesome ringtones they have all your favorites at some random address blogspot com
7159345 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7159346 it would just be better to get an american on my side we were both pretty mutual about it he said hed really do it if i really wanted him to but it would work better if i found an american
7159347 we talked about it before it was kind of just like joking around saying i cant have you caddying for me and he says i cant work for you just giving each other a lot grief but deep down we both knew what was going to happen so it made it easier
7159348 i hope you will support my work on amtrak as much as i have supported you
7159349 1992 bmw 325i 5 speed manual trans 1200 must go today
7159350 what is it that notices the talking of the mind
7159351 considering the circumstances the boks were in they were quite desperate after last week this is a significant win
7159352 weve had a tough time of it in the last few years not winning here since 2000 and the fact its always difficult so were very satisfied
7159353 were simply not hanging on to the ball for more than three phases if we can keep the ball then we can turn it around its very disappointing but theres no time to waste we have to go back and work on the mistakes were making on the field
7159354 we again created good opportunities but just didnt carry it through the guys must just believe in themselves
7159355 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7159356 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7159357 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7159358 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7159359 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7159360 i thought as much sir when you mentioned rabbits the thing about rabbits sir is that everybody has one id like to see you step up to the goat class where i feel you belong frankly you look more like a goat man to me
7159361 the distinct advantage of a goat is that it can be taught to butt anyone who tries to steal it
7159362 not if they shoot it with a hypno dart and descend by rope ladder from a hovering hovercar
7159363 a goat is loyal and it has a free natural soul which no cage can chain up and there is one exceptional additional feature about goats one which you may not be aware of often times when you invest in an animal and take it home you find some morning that its eaten something radioactive and died a goat isnt bothered by contaminated quasi foodstuff it can eat eclectically even items that would fell a cow or a horse or most especially a cat as a long term investment we feel that the goat especially the female offers unbeatable advantages to the serious animal owner
7159364 ive just got to make sure that im on top of how i train in golf your body is the no 1 thing
7159365 youre only this way because you havent met a real man
7159366 its not something that any parent would choose for their child
7159367 oh betty betty i couldnt no i couldnt its when i think of that yes its quite true i like him all right i do indeed but only as long as he doesnt come too near
7159368 i think what howard dean has done at the dnc is exactly right
7159369 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7159370 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7159371 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7159372 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7159373 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7159374 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7159375 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7159376 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7159377 the national truck driving championships showcase the industrys commitment to safety
7159378 i applaud all the competitors for their efforts in making our highways safe and congratulate dennis for demonstrating how a dedication to safe driving skills can make you a grand champion
7159379 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7159380 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7159381 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7159382 iraq to dispatch special team to turkey for talks over
7159383 we believe that without investments in soa governance 60 90 of soa related projects will fail to deliver a positive return on investment
7159384 it is not possible to benefit from soa as an approach unless you can effectively leverage and manage soa artifacts not just services themselves but also soa related policies processes and metadata
7159385 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in the agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7159386 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7159387 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7159388 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7159389 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7159390 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7159391 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7159392 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7159393 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7159394 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7159395 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7159396 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7159397 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly
7159398 it shouldnt be traumatizing for a person who is inclined to agree with the decriminalization movement to walk through hempfest

7159410 the real test of the new teams leadership will come in the first half of next year that is when palm plans to announce a next generation of software and a new device which it hopes will make it easier for consumers to surf the web and network with friends and colleagues
7159411 i know its partly our fault because we always bring her but i dont like how she just assumes shes invited
7159412 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7159413 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7159414 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7159415 i have nothing my neighbours feed me if they have food to share
7159416 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7159417 georgia is not a member of this organisation so the troops must leave very quickly
7159418 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7159419 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7159420 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7159421 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again

7159424 weve waited for this moment for four years if you think we played hard the last seven games just wait until sunday
7159425 darius has been in twice for workouts with us and has impressed us with his progress health and attitude darius will have the next couple of months to prove to myself and coach rivers that he can help us win
7159426 i thought theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend their offense is so well conceived for their personnel
7159427 the orders come from brussels rather than moscow now this is the kind of dictatorship we are talking about
7159428 the us constitution is a simple document it covers 50 states comes in a passport size format and every us schoolchild is familiar with it
7159429 they were trying to correct it in an unintelligible drivel
7159430 deliberately made the controversial charter unintelligible drivel so us peasants would not be able to understand it
7159431 the eu failed to communicate its message to the citizens in member states especially in ireland
7159432 well this is his third year in a row because he likes to swim
7159433 this is just a great event to pay homage to our canine companions and just the fact that theyre out here and enjoying the park and actually being able to bring the dogs out and have them enjoy the pool
7159434 the government of mexico asked us to give the cemex businessmen another chance to see if we can reach an understanding
7159435 but the mexicans of this company have been arrogant very arrogant and we demand respect here buddy
7159436 we want to settle this in a friendly way like we did with the french who stay on here as our partners
7159437 challenged the government and i dont know what else at the meetings
7159438 we believe that humans evolved from pirates consider that humans share
7159439 its more that they feel that im american it doesnt matter where i was born

7159441 but i know georgia has very good relations with other countries and the world is not blind and will not just stand by

7159449 jika begitu lahir bayi langsung dimandikan refleks menyusu ini langsung hilang 50 persen jika bayi lahir dengan operasi caesar dan langsung dimandikan refleks itu 100 persen hilang
7159450 bila melihat efek yang luar biasa pada bayi kenapa kita tidak mencoba mempraktekkannya tetapi memang usaha ini bukan perkara mudah karena bukan saja terkait dengan kebiasaan yang sudah mengakar masyarakat tetapi juga harus berhadapan dengan produsen susu formula yang melakukan praktek gelap di rumah sakit
7159451 menghisap susu dari botol itu lain dengan menghisap puting susu ibu bayi harus belajar sejak awal dan ibu juga harus belajar menyusui karena ketrampilan itu memang harus dipelajari oleh keduanya
7159452 gudang asi terletak di bawah daerah cokelat itu jika yang diisap hanya putingnya saja asi yang keluar hanya sedikit sedangkan kalau dari daerah cokelat itu asi yang keluar akan banyak sekali
7159453 makanya hormon ini disebut hormon kasih sayang dan di sinilah ayah memegang peranan penting
7159454 tidak ada cerita seorang ibu tidak bisa menyusui atau asi yang tidak cukup perhatikan saja seekor marmut yang kecil bisa menyusui 12 ekor anaknya bayi gajah yang besar juga bisa disusui dengan cukup oleh induknya mereka tidak memerlukan susu hewan lain untuk memenuhi kebutuhan susu asi diproduksi berdasarkan jumlah yang dikeluarkan
7159455 itu antara lain terjadi karena pengetahuan ibu tentang pentingnya asi masih rendah tatalaksana rumah sakit yang salah dan banyaknya ibu yang mempunyai pekerjaan di luar rumah
7159456 tidak ada yang bisa menggantikan asi karena asi didesain khusus untuk bayi sedangkan susu sapi komposisinya sangat berbeda sehingga tidak bisa saling menggantikan
7159457 lagi pula penambahan zat zat gizi tersebut jika tidak dilakukan dalam jumlah dan komposisi yang seimbang maka akan menimbulkan terbentuknya zat yang berbahaya bagi bayi
7159458 menurut penelitian anak anak yang tidak diberi asi mempunyai iq intellectual quotient lebih rendah tujuh sampai delapan poin dibandingkan dengan anak anak yang diberi asi secara eksklusif karena itu mengkonsumsi asi bagi bayi merupakan hak anak yang hakiki
7159459 ibu juga tidak perlu susah susah melakukan diet untuk mengecilkan perut setelah melahirkan karena hisapan anak pada puting susu ibu merangsang keluarnya hormon yang dapat mengencangkan dinding dinding perut ibu kembali

7159470 dang this wont be as easy as wed hoped darn those state delegates why must they be so devoted to those silly party rules rather than us hmmm we need a different strategy to deliver those votes to mccain
7159471 forget about it guys as long as its up to us utahs national delegates must cast their first set of ballots for whichever candidate received the most votes in utahs primary election and that was romney by a landslide sorry
7159472 hey thats it well just redefine what the meaning of the word is is er candidate lets see hmmm lets say that the candidate who received the most votes in our primary election does not apply to candidates who suspend their campaigns once the primary election is over so although romney was initially the candidate who received the most votes with 89 since he suspended his campaign he no longer counts and so mccain has now became the candidate who received the most votes with only 5 once we pervert these rules those darn rule respecting utahns can follow them and still give us what we want why didnt we think of this devious scheme sooner
7159473 hey thats not what those who wrote us meant to
7159474 shut up youll mean what we say you mean now central committee we need you to vote to approve our new screwy interpretation that weve invented so that it will serve as a new standing rule for our party
7159475 okay 85 of us say hey whatever you want boss
7159476 hurrah we won eat that voters and delegates as you can see your votes only count when we like the outcome we not your silly rules are the supreme power in this party bwahahaha

7159498 rfid tag scanner located in the desired tracking location scans the rfid tags on a person as that person moves around the store different rfid tag scanners located throughout the store can pick up radio signals from the rfid tags carried on that person and the movement of that person is tracked based on these detections the person tracking unit may keep records of different locations where the person has visited as well as the visitation times

7159541 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7159542 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7159543 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7159544 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7159545 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7159546 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7159547 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7159548 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7159549 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7159550 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7159551 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7159552 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7159553 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7159554 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7159555 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7159556 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7159557 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7159558 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7159559 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7159560 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7159561 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7159562 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7159563 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7159564 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7159565 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7159566 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7159567 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7159568 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7159569 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7159570 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7159571 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7159572 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7159573 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7159574 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7159575 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7159576 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7159577 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7159578 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7159579 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7159580 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7159581 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7159582 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7159583 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7159584 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7159585 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7159586 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7159587 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7159588 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7159589 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7159590 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7159591 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7159592 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7159593 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7159594 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7159595 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7159596 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7159597 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7159598 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7159599 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7159600 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7159601 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7159602 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7159603 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7159604 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7159605 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7159606 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7159607 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7159608 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7159609 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7159610 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7159611 seu estado era grave e s nos resta dar apoio fam lia
7159612 estamos trabalhando o mais r pido poss vel tanto a pol cia como a guarda civil e o instituto m dico legal

7159616 incredibly bolt 21 could have gone faster with a full seven strides to go he dropped his arms and let them fall outstretched to his sides appearing almost to run sideways as he played to the soldout crowd of 91 000 at the birds nest just before the finish line he started high stepping and for good measure executed a chest thump
7159617 you kids at home this is not how you behave as an olympic champion
7159618 usain was simply being himself he likes to celebrate when he does well and there was no time he was trying to put down the other runners in the race
7159619 let me defend usain bolt from prudes like bob costas who apparently felt that someone whose week long display of flamboyant sycophancy of michael phelps qualifies him as a journalistic paragon who might preach unchallenged from the anchors pulpit
7159620 dont blame him for being so far ahead at 85 meters that he could celebrate early surely if anyone in the rest of the field was closer to him he would have dug in again not for any world record but for this olympic ideal costas claims he disrespects
7159621 we are honored to be included as a stop on the consumer electronics associations free trade bus tour that is going across america
7159622 the cea understands how important it is to all businesses and their employees both large and small to have open markets around the world without free trade thiels opportunity for growing and adding jobs is greatly diminished
7159623 we are grateful to be a part of an organization willing to take a stand and invest money and hard work to educate citizens about the benefits of open markets for all americans everywhere
7159624 additionally we are optimistic and excited to be a part of an increasingly open and peaceful world where opportunities to create wealth elevate living standards and find harmonious common ground through trade with foreign countries are advancing thank you cea
7159625 currently the state government is not planning to declare tuesday as a public holiday unless we have to
7159626 but we are not closing the door on this subject either in case barisan nasional comes up with sudden tactics to stop voters from coming out to vote
7159627 were still not sure of the impact morality is a serious thing to the malays and saiful did swear on the quran and he did it in a mosque
7159628 anwar says the courts are not going to be fair the police and ag are biased the dna will be manipulated in other words no one is to be trusted we can understand it if he doesnt believe in people but he says he is also not swearing on the quran so who is he afraid of

7159631 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7159632 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7159633 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7159634 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7159635 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7159636 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7159637 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7159638 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7159639 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7159640 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7159641 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7159642 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7159643 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7159644 i have read and agree to the terms of service
7159645 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7159646 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7159647 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7159648 joe bidens statement that barack obama is not ready to be president of the united states is something we should listen to
7159649 i dont get into the vp speculation because that sets off another round of articles and so much of it is just speculation and so much ends up to be inaccurate so i just stopped answering vp questions
7159650 im just delighted and honored to support sen mccain as a volunteer and as somebody who i just believe is going to be a great president for our country
7159651 it seems that his rhetoric has been around change there needs to be change in washington and he has used for his political advantage this concept of the need for washington outsiders
7159652 then when he has one of his first big decisions he chooses the consummate washington insider which i think is noteworthy
7159653 hes an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country
7159654 after the tactics used by the mccain camp to attack biden it will not be romney
7159655 i think this proves that pawlenty can be a sufficiently effective attack dog
7159656 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7159657 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7159658 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7159659 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7159660 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7159661 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7159662 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field
7159663 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7159664 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7159665 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7159666 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7159667 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7159668 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7159669 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7159670 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7159671 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7159672 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7159673 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7159674 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7159675 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7159676 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7159677 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7159678 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7159679 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7159680 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7159681 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7159682 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7159683 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7159684 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7159685 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7159686 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7159687 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7159688 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7159689 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7159690 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7159691 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7159692 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7159693 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7159694 di pc tampilan desktop windows akan berubah menjadi seperti macintosh
7159695 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7159696 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7159697 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7159698 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7159699 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7159700 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7159701 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7159702 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7159703 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7159704 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7159705 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7159706 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7159707 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7159708 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7159709 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7159710 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7159711 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7159712 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7159713 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7159714 if im such a bigshot because of my seniority here why am i a furry

7159727 the only thing worse than the idea that this death has no purpose would be the idea that it did
7159728 being is no longer the essential matter to be thought
7159729 there is today any spiritual room within the institutions or organisations that seek to foster respect for indian religious philosophical traditions for a body of knowledge that seeks not only to build a bridge between deep scholarly and philosophical studies of these traditions and their personal experiential practice but goes even further offering a radical conceptual and experiential refoundation of those traditions rather than merely parroting their traditional terms and mimicking their traditional practices in the manner of so many current yogic schools and gurus
7159730 your dilemma is that you have not only revered the original tantras gained a felt comprehension of them and written about them but also conceptually refined them even corrected them that is probably too much for most people
7159731 all my words and writings together can be compared to mere ciphers or inscriptions on the outside of a box either scaring off the reader or inviting them to open it the box itself however is far larger inside that it appears from without its interior is a boundless time space of awareness and an inexhaustible source of deep inner knowing whosoever dares to open this box or allow it to be opened for them through direct personal instruction and initiation must not only have an intelligent and open mind but great spiritual courage
7159732 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7159733 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7159734 i am extremely pleased with the selection of joe biden as the vice presidential nominee i believe he compliments barack obamas candidacy because of his firm foundation in the american middle class
7159735 senator biden has never forgotten his working class roots and hasnt succumbed to the inside the beltway mentality he remains today a product of scranton pennsylvania who resides in delaware and happens to work in washington
7159736 his credentials on capitol hill are impeccable with extraordinary leadership on foreign affairs and strengthening our nations commitment to protecting the homeland with more and better equipped police officers and firefighters
7159737 we can now understand our schools as they exist and we have an improving image of what sustainable schools look like but how do we get there from here how do we find our way to the sustainability we yearn for

7159744 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7159745 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7159746 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it

7159750 the storm is actually weakening thats not to say were not going to have rain
7159751 were still expecting some flooding because of this weve got everything on standby hopefully it wont come to that
7159752 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7159753 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7159754 they always start with sweet reasonableness you know we love your programs isnt nature marvellous and so on but they always go on to say we do wonder why it is that you dont give credit to the almighty god who created each one of these species individually
7159755 is that when creationists talk about god creating every individual species as a separate act they always instance hummingbirds or orchids sunflowers and beautiful things but i tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in west africa a worm thats going to make him blind and i ask them are you telling me that the god you believe in who you also say is an all merciful god who cares for each one of us individually are you saying that god created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent childs eyeball because that doesnt seem to me to coincide with a god whos full of mercy

7159828 its not so fair in my opinion because its very expensive technology its for a rich country
7159829 i think its hard to tell because this pool is bullet fast i dont think you can say the suits made everyone faster they certainly contributed
7159830 but if you think its 100 per cent attributable to the performance movement in swimming then you are underestimating the work the coaches and the swimmers put in
7159831 you put on a suit that you know has broken so many world records you are going to be fast
7159832 to break that many records there has to be technology
7159833 im used to finishing on top and im very fortunate and lucky to have that distinction
7159834 its a little bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i wanted its not a failure you shoot for the stars sometimes you only make it to the moon
7159835 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7159836 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that
7159837 i didnt know what else to do i probably had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either i tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say yesterday or today which is strange because i usually eat it up
7159838 i said i wanted to be strong confident triumphant and the last one was adam
7159839 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with for the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races until now but they really dont matter once you get here because its this one that counts puts a lot of pressure on me and it has put a lot of pressure on me
7159840 he learned very early how to win gracefully and i was always very proud of that
7159841 hes i think dealing with not being no 1 as gracefully im proud of him still its a new thing he learned
7159842 the last 24 hours have been quite difficult whereas the 24 hours following my thousand performance in athens were elated and quite relieved and very happy and that contributed to my 500 performance
7159843 i guess could say similarly that the disappointment contributed to my 500 performance today in a very different way
7159844 i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it marnie mcbean former canadian rower told me to fight like a tiger and i tried to it was really tough thats why kenny passed me i was toast
7159845 my head kind of fell down and then i was like man if i dont see my name in third im going to i dont know try and disappear
7159846 and then second disappeared and my heart raced again i thought i was second i thought id crossed the line a metre in front of tim but you never know
7159847 all im hearing is hooray the fish are back the fish are back
7159848 we have been down in the dumps for so long

7159854 clinically the question of ssri induced suicidal homicidal behavior has always been a tough one these medications arent prescribed to people who are trooping along just fine suicidality is a very common symptom of depression and ssris are prescribed for depression were left wondering if the ssri caused the suicidality began working and lifted the patient to the point of being able to act on the thoughts shifted the patient into a bipolar mixed state or simply was ineffective in treating the depression and was incidental to the final act
7159855 these proposals are completely wrong they allow the secretary of state to remove a case from a jury on the vague ground that it is in the public interest the whole thing is an appalling violation of the separation of powers
7159856 these proposed changes will ensure inquests are as thorough as possible by ensuring that the coroner can always examine all material central to the inquests even if the material cannot be disclosed publicly they will ensure families can have absolute confidence in the conclusion the coroner reaches because the coroner will have had access to all the evidence
7159857 we have a congress who spends money like john edwards at a beauty parlor
7159858 its interesting that would be asked of someone running for president im not going to be writing the school curriculum im simply asking for an opportunity to lead our country but since you asked i believe that in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth

7159863 it has been submitted to the senate i dont want to comment hopefully they will have hearings when sessions resume were not the only one that has not ratified the others are thailand and indonesia
7159864 what president arroyo said is that some senators will have a problem ratifying she was saying her view but its a priority for us the charter
7159865 we wanted the philippines to cooperate in the aspect of ratification if they will not ratify there may be a problem
7159866 we werent sure until the permanent secretary stressed that it was carol vorderman
7159867 he pointed out she was incredibly good at maths and then showed us some highlights from countdown

7159871 there are two main benefits from the use of lantern
7159872 firstly it helps establish someones identity which can result in the apprehension of more criminals
7159873 secondly in normal circumstances if a person stopped is unable to verify who they are they are arrested taken to a police station and have their fingerprints taken in custody
7159874 now this can be done in quick time out on the streets reducing the inconvenience to members of the public stopped and freeing up officers both out on patrol and back in custody

7159912 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for senator obama in the campaign and in the white house
7159913 for the republican to be in a dead heat with the democrat is remarkable as much as americans want change americans are generally cautious people george w bush was not president for two terms for no reason and bill clinton did not run as a different democrat for no reason this is a right of center country the country is a lot more conservative than people living in providence r i may think

7159920 dakota county butts up to the city of st paul so we feel like we want to be a good and active partner during the rnc
7159921 we had to do some creative scheduling because we dont want this initiative to be shouldered by the good people of eagan
7159922 its not going to cost us any money we anticipate recouping all of our expenses through the st paul police department
7159923 we have a great responsibility in assisting with the details up at the rnc
7159924 plus we have to be prepared should anything happen within dakota county thats rnc related that we have an adequate response
7159925 were going to have our normal staffing schedule on every night during the rnc
7159926 we have 18 officers who have volunteered to work off duty so it will not impact our service levels for on duty staffing
7159927 its going to be a once in a lifetime experience
7159928 i dont see it coming back again in my career
7159929 every time weve asked st paul to come and assist us with their bomb squad or the hugo tornado incident theyre always more than willing to send people and resources
7159930 this is a regional event in terms of law enforcement security
7159931 dakota county butts up to the city of st paul so we feel like we want to be a good and active partner during the rnc
7159932 we have a great responsibility in assisting with the details up at the rnc

7159937 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in the agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7159938 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7159939 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7159940 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7159941 were just making sure that the right people are allowed to get through access points
7159942 were just doing what we can to help the st paul police man a little corner of the city

7159947 good point i have realized that while burning the new candles i am pretty disappointed i think method needs to drop the price and redesign them or add another wick
7159948 you are the messiah the son of the living god
7159949 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it
7159950 this is a class by class meet where all classes run with the same runners
7159951 we dont normally run this weekend or this early but it was good to find out who is going to be on our varsity squad
7159952 it was a sloppy course with a lot of turns and when i went out to walk the course i had mud up to my shins
7159953 a year ago smith was running 11 32 a week later in the season so she is on pace to get back on track i anticipate her running in the low 11s next week at our invitational
7159954 our second best runner wasnt here today but our second best runner today was jenna pisarski
7159955 i was real pleased with baumeister and he did better than i anticipated
7159956 mostly because last week in a time trial he wasnt our best this was a strong field with strake jesuit who was the region champ last year kingwood and atascocita
7159957 for the sophomores roland is a move in so i didnt know what to expect from him but both him and patrick are going to be able to fill in some holes due to graduation overall i think we just held our own
7159958 the only year that i didnt know the kids was that first year when i came here in 2001
7159959 there is nothing like winning when you have the talent
7159960 but that just means that the other talented players have to wait like these kids have behind some pretty good football players weve won 20 ball games in two years and though that doesnt equal to any wins this year tradition does help and these kids want to keep that going
7159961 with him being a junior he will benefit from this because we can bring him along slowly
7159962 he is a smart kid who can put us in the best opportunities for our team he hangs on to the football and makes players around him better chase is a leader and other players listen
7159963 travis probably could have done more running for us last year but we had a pretty good one in yobes
7159964 but when yobes got hurt travis gained over 150 yards in that playoff game against fort bend marshall
7159965 we have our offense in place we like to run the ball
7159966 when you lose so many seniors it is a mad dash but the weather hasnt been very cooperative in some of the things weve wanted to establish with this group
7159967 we are basically looking for consistency and just want these guys to put a hat on somebody if they can bring that consistency and aggressiveness and stay with their blocks we can start to separate the five from this pack
7159968 bradley is just one of those gifted and talented kids
7159969 he played six games as a freshman and backing him up are jose amador and dartwan bush we are probably going to play a lot of these players both ways but they wont be starting both ways
7159970 dartwan just has so much untapped potential but he has performed well
7159971 they simmons green dont have a lot of experience but are very athletic
7159972 simmons played a little fullback last year but has taken off at this position as for green he had a good freshman campaign but is very athletic and wants to do well
7159973 the little bit of experience that we have will come from this group
7159974 because of will playing more on offense jacob simpson will do some kicking and punting to take some of that load off will
7159975 it is a pretty nice luxury to have will there with jacob just in case
7159976 i am glad we are going to be able to catch our breath with a bye week after those three before we start district
7159977 our holes are going to be glaring but these kids are used to winning here
7159978 hey its just typing who in the world couldnt do a job like this
7159979 for instance joseph biden comes off as a liberal democrat but hes the one who authored the bill that put me in jail he wrote the law against shipping drug paraphernalia through the mail which could be anything from a pipe to a clip or cigarette papers
7159980 we have not devoted nearly enough science or time to deal with the pain management and chronic pain management that exists theres got to be a better answer than marijuana
7159981 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
7159982 which was like this completely worthless scumball planet that me and quinch
7159983 we have his family with him there in the dallas area
7159984 hes in good spirits and after his surgery tomorrow well have our doctors address the surgery
7159985 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7159986 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7159987 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7159988 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7159989 its a big ball pick not a small ball pick
7159990 he really sees the court and hes a very unselfish player he always had four happy players around him
7159991 because most guys feel i didnt have a chance at the position coach gillispie had his trust in me
7159992 i know he will push me to the limit and make me the best person i can be hell push me to get in shape and get me ready to go he said i could play defense and guard the smallest guy to the tallest guy he liked that versatility
7159993 i know he continues to work on it he definitely makes up for it
7159994 he really is itll be a transition but if one player can do it its kevin
7159995 i feel i can get a lot better just playing with these guys
7159996 just the competition playing against each other is going to make all of us better
7159997 i think itll do wonders for the image of the program
7159998 one of the things we have to obviously overcome is tradition weve had moments but it hasnt been sustained
7159999 its willingness to give our kids everything they need to have a chance to be successful
