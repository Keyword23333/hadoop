7370003 our minimum is five officers and when you have five officers covering a large county like this you can run its not uncommon for officers to run 15 to 20 miles from run to run and that does eat up quite a bit of gas
7370004 we want to stop the crime before it gets out of hand and it will take more officers in more cars using up more gas but we feel thats whats important is public safety

7370035 basically the fight we are fighting is contest of will it is us against the islamists bem rk at siad generaliser samtlige muslimer til at v re islamister og dermed deres fjender and the ones with the strongest will will prevail we have the resources the organisation but we lack the will if regain the incentive to fight for our own fine culture the fight will be over in a very short time without much bloodshed if we do not fight it will come to civil war our success will be defined by two things courage and actions the only one in this room that does not hide himself behind a funny name is anders and i think one of the secrets of siads success is the courage of anders to stand up in the open and defy the islamist in his own name that works this is a very dangerous fight some of us in this room will die but that is a price we should be willing to pay because it is better to loose your life than to loose your freedom but if we have the will and the courage we will win

7370076 expectations in the commercial world are currently set too high
7370077 some vendors and market players have portrayed the fact that grid could be the answer to everything and it isnt
7370078 the adoption of grid is still very much in its infancy
7370079 the concept of grid technology within the financial sector is not only over hyped but misused
7370080 grid in the true sense of the word will allow an organisation to seamlessly tap in and use spare computer capacity which exists beyond the boundaries of the organisation
7370081 using grid computing firms have reduced their time to calculate var from 10 or 20 hours to 15 or 30 minutes
7370082 without having to acquire a new super computer or a number of large very expensive unix boxes
7370083 we are booking larger more exotic and more lucrative trades with more accurate risk taking
7370084 the further up the yield curve you go the bigger the margins are
7370085 we know that some of these guys are increasing their revenues by tens of millions of dollars a year
7370086 the big saving is redeployment of people having their expensive development resource focused on what they are best at which is building business logic rather than plumbing
7370087 people are still working out how to apply it in commerce and finance
7370088 ive seen some grids beginning to go in they tend to be quite small and they tend to be around things where grid obviously makes a lot of sense
7370089 the technology is getting much better and much easier to deploy
7370090 there are some investment banks that have ambitious objectives in this area over the next four or five years all the critical data they want to get to on a worldwide basis should be open for secure access to anyone who needs it in the bank
7370091 it is the ability to virtualise at the application level in order to have the infrastructure running independently of the application so that you are not tied into any operating system or technology and the technology and processing resource in the enterprise is a fungible resource any processor anywhere can be used by the application
7370092 the technology is emerging but i think some of the governance management and security issues have not been fully resolved yet

7370094 having thought out before hand any accident or situation that might occur so that you will know the right thing to do at the right moment and are willing to do it
7370095 we are actually detecting frauds that companies have never seen before because they didnt know they existed
7370096 ilp can represent virtually anything you want to in the terms of a mathematical function
7370097 can be encoded and used to steer the kind of patterns that you are looking for
7370098 when we first meet they look at us like we have two heads
7370099 i can think of some credit card companies that have been creating two or three rules every day for the last 15 years
7370100 the problem is that a rule created in 1995 is not necessarily relevant in 2004 the rules get out of date very quickly and they clog the system up
7370101 just questioning a transaction can create a domino effect of costs that really is quite frightening one of them can build up into tens of thousands of dollars
7370102 we have one customer who tells us that false positives cost them 400m a year that is a massive amount of money going out of the door for nothing
7370103 the robustness of each and every solution has to be tested in anger in a real time environment some are winning and some are failing
7370104 we dont pretend to pick up something that is definitely fraudulent or definitely should be investigated by internal audit we pick up things that you need to look at because they are different
7370105 the business problem is finding the right way of dealing with the volume of suspicious events that the system spits out
7370106 say it is a suspicious event with a prized customer if you get that conversation wrong you will lose that customer and their ten best friends its hard to find people who can have those complex conversations without upsetting the customer
7370107 how do they audit these systems when there is something going on inside the black box that they do not understand
7370108 how do they know that these solutions are being effective this is a new development that could help mitigate a risk but organisations have got to check that it is being done properly management responsibility to understand it is not reduced simply because it is complex
7370109 there are many applications where all you really want is a black box that predicts as accurately as it can you dont care what is going on inside the box
7370110 but in other applications it is critical that you have a white box you should be able to open it up and understand it if you rely only on the predictions then you wont really get any insight into what is being said in fraud detection for example you wont be able to see the patterns that are coming out and use those in an intelligent fashion to reduce fraud

7370117 losing their place at the table when it comes to influencing reputation and strategy
7370118 but it appears that finance is rolling backwards in terms of being able to make a real impact
7370119 we are going through a period of considerable change in which there is a continuing onslaught of legislation
7370120 we will eventually get to the position where the current level of compliance becomes the norm
7370121 we hope that the pendulum will swing back towards the middle where managers are seen as genuine honest people who are there to make money
7370122 every time i see a light at the end of the tunnel i realise its just people building a new extension to the tunnel
7370123 todays finance department is under greater pressure than ever to deliver strategic value to the business
7370124 this is impossible if staff are focused on mundane tasks that do not propel the business forward
7370125 applications that smooth sarbanes oxley and ifrs compliance are widely becoming the norm
7370126 automated systems can then help to streamline their implementation and to enforce them reducing the risk of malfeasance and errors and improving confidence in business data
7370127 while this is not a silver bullet it could reduce the extent of effort in meeting these requirements
7370128 many companies already have bi in place for compliance reporting
7370129 forward looking organisations will now leverage their bi platform to take advantage of the latest bi innovations alongside planning software taking them beyond just understanding their business and enabling them to proactively manage it and drive performance
7370130 as this shift occurs it will have a huge impact on the role of the fd and that of the finance function as a whole
7370131 to adapt and stay competitive a business must use information to better plan better measure and make better business decisions fast
7370132 the custodian of the new improved management processes focused on commercial decision taking
7370133 the result has been a general lack of interest in innovation
7370134 forward thinking fds will use technology to turn compliance to their advantage
7370135 technology can ease the compliance burden but it is not carte blanche for fds to take their eyes off the ball
7370136 it is essential they stay informed and have the relevant facts figures and numbers at their fingertips and the right technology means this is easily achievable
7370137 b2b weee is left very open ended in the directive
7370138 it is up to businesses to decide how they will arrange collections and meet recycling targets how much of this cost they will pass back to the customer and how and when they will do this
7370139 there are so many people to consult that it has been quite tough to get everyone involved in agreement
7370140 companies have not been able to agree between themselves whether they like the idea of a national clearing house or not
7370141 manufacturers are committed to keeping recycling costs as low as possible but must be able to pass them on to consumers
7370142 at the same time we must ensure that consumers do not pay more for recycling than the costs involved consumers must be able to see that they are paying a recycling fee for legitimate weee related costs and know that it is ring fenced entirely for that purpose
7370143 the generation and sale of technology involves many more parties who have not been asked to shoulder the burden for recycling
7370144 these are without question challenging times the unprecedented boom in hardware sales spurred by fears of the millennium bug has been followed inevitably by tougher trading conditions shouldering extra costs is the last thing that most technology sector companies need at the moment
7370145 the corporations legally defined mandate is to pursue relentlessly and without exception its own self interest regardless of the often harmful consequences it might cause others
7370146 the corporation is a pathological institution the dangerous possessor of the great power it wields over people and societies
7370147 hypocrisy is virtuous when it serves the bottom line moral virtue is immoral when it does not
7370148 under the new guidelines prosecutors will look to see what kind of culture the company has
7370149 are employees rewarded for cutting corners and bending the rules what kinds of people are put in senior positions if the culture of the company is poisoned that is going to affect the way employees do their jobs and will get the business into trouble
7370150 the us is in one of those phases where law is overwhelming companies
7370151 sarbanes oxley is making a whole range of things compulsory which before were much more discretionary i always think thats not the way to do ethics it makes it a process and a box ticking exercise rather than encouraging people to make decisions based on the values of the organisation i think the act has probably put back the cause of business ethics some years
7370152 the public wants people they can trust not just people checking off the boxes
7370153 the act has put this on the radar screens of many organisations that did not recognise it as important
7370154 boards of directors increasingly recognise that it is important for them to realise what is really going on i dont view that as a setback
7370155 a wave of opposition squarely targeting transnational corporations particularly those with very high name brand recognition
7370156 weve been fairly quite for the past three years in corporate responsibility because of the kasky lawsuit
7370157 so were using this report to play a little catch up and draw a more complete picture
7370158 but they needed to do it both for transparency and for their own good
7370159 but to be ethical because it is profitable is not ethical
7370160 this is understandable shareholders money will have to be spent if a corporate ethical programme is to have any credibility let alone effectiveness
7370161 but the question has to be asked is this the best reason for adopting a business ethics programme developing a code training reporting and regular reviews and revisions
7370162 the tide of immigrants from the a8 countries has clearly bottomed out as more find jobs at home or elsewhere in europe the governments official barometer shows that the number of eastern europeans applying to work in the uk has fallen by 9 000 during the past quarter which indicates that the credit crunch has had a particularly negative impact
7370163 employers have benefitted from the increased supply of skilled and unskilled labour from eastern europe
7370164 however the wider economy looks set to be less affected as unemployment gains worrying momentum the latest cipd kpmg ipsos mori labour market outlook survey published last week indicates that the jobs situation will continue to deteriorate in the coming quarter with economic prospects improving in the accession countries relative to the uks position it is unsurprising that the eastern europeans are leaving the country in greater numbers than before
7370165 continues to receive the most secure supply of electricity in the country
7370166 that means on average a customer in london may experience a power cut once every three years
7370167 these cuts affected several thousand customers and in both cases power was restored by remote switching to alternative supplies within five minutes
7370168 disruption of power supply is not a difficult thing to recover from
7370169 a power outage is just part and parcel of a disaster recovery and business continuity plan
7370170 one of the tests should be to pull out the power plug
7370171 two out of five hospital generators failed even though they were signed off by facilities managers
7370172 with everybody operating just in time systems there is no slack for someone to get it wrong
7370173 you can get so engrossed in a business change that everything is focused on the systems and technology with no time to look at the business continuity requirements there is a window in which you could be exposed
7370174 like something out of a james bond movie or mission impossible
7370175 it wont kill you but its not good to be in it
7370176 its hand dig only nobody can use more than a shovel
7370177 we are constantly thinking about how we can stop stuff going wrong or have systems in place to ensure that when things do go wrong it doesnt affect our customers
7370178 weve havent been able to categorically say that it was either a human error or a technical problem which is unfortunate
7370179 there has been a sweep across the globe of jurisdictions introducing new rules and enforcing them or enforcing existing rules more strictly
7370180 questions to do with transfer pricing are consistently in number one or number two place
7370181 a clear reflection of the increased importance of transfer pricing
7370182 these results show that tax authorities in other countries as well as the traditional global financial centres are now likely to challenge the industry on its transfer pricing policies
7370183 they have the increased responsibility of anticipating and effectively managing potential tax risks
7370184 if left unchecked these risks could compromise the integrity of financial statements and lead to significant costs resulting from double taxation interest penalties and importantly the costs of management time required to respond to the challenges
7370185 tax cannot remain in the splendid isolation to which its technical nature and its perceived independence from the business mainstream have historically placed it
7370186 in the past there was a clear distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion
7370187 the distinction remains clear in law but has become blurred in the minds of governments regulators and the public

7370202 the kangaroo flat boys are going pretty well this year which has been good for the supporters mr brooks said

7370214 his method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victims legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body the end of the stake was usually oiled and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp else the victim might die too rapidly from shock normally the stake was inserted into the body through the anus and was often forced through the body until it emerged from the mouth however there were many instances where victims were impaled through other bodily orifices or through the abdomen or chest infants were sometimes impaled on the stake forced through their mothers chests the records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake as expected death by impalement was slow and painful victims sometimes endured for hours or days vlad often had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns the most common pattern was a ring of concentric circles in the outskirts of a city that constituted his target the height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim the corpses were often left decaying for months

7370219 the gap between telstra market will close over time if pay increases are policy based
7370220 it shows that as a result of the collective agreement that telstras average pay is the best in the industry but the company wants to reduce the gap by offering smaller wage increases
7370221 it shows primarily the aim of the game is to reduce labour costs and that means people are going to have a reduction in their take home pay and their conditions of employment
7370222 telstra is a real live example of the need for a proper collective bargaining regime to be in place telstra has been prepared to flout the decision of the australian people last year thats why we need the legislation in place as quickly as possible so we at least ensure telstra is required to bargain in good faith they havent done that

7370227 thats right the mccains pay 270 000 per year for butlers and 50 000 more than the median value of an american home

7370229 when john edwards was running for president and the media were obsessing about his wealth they linked his fortune to his policy positions surely john mccain who cant remember how many houses he owns jokes that you arent rich unless you make 5 million a year and supports tax policies that would save him and his wife cindy nearly 400 000 a year should be held to the same standard

7370323 i am lilith goddess of the night in your world i have many names i was created by the old spirits along with adam to him i was nothing but an object to be used for his own pleasure but i wanted equality when i expressed my feelings to him he rejected the idea that i was his equal so i left him in the garden and wandered the wide world the old spirits came to me one night they told me that adam had cursed me he had cursed me to live forever only able to take nourishment from the purest of human blood he cursed me to be abhorred by humankind for eternity all this if i did not repent and return to him in the garden the spirits were not pleased with adams curse and they were not pleased that i would not return to him so the spirits cursed me anew they cursed me to be the mother of demons and they took adams side granting him a new more docile wife you know her to be named eve mankind was created from her womb and demonkind from mine adam regretted his curse finding that my children would feast on eves and grow stronger the spirits were not happy with the way adam had handled things and so exiled him from the garden and covered it with a great flood so that his kin could never return the old spirits left the world disappointed by eves children and sickened by mine so the two species thrived side by side with no interference from the old spirits humankind hardly knows of our existence with the exception of legends that died in the eighteenth century the last few generations have developed new legends woven from the fabric of the old ones but to them they are only stories no one knows we truly exist some suspect our presence but none accept us as an actuality you are wondering where we are

7370421 the two countries have established a good neighbourly partnership and enjoyed friendship generation upon generation
7370422 we hope that men from across the uk will be inspired to attend this event in their droves there has been so much negative press recently about black men in particular
7370423 it is my hope that the national band of brothers conference will play a part in redressing the balance and inspire attendees to play a part in addressing some of the pressing problems we are witnessing in british society
7370424 the mens room is keen to engage with wider society thats why we have participated in schemes and projects that benefit to men in communities across the country
7370425 we believe that this years conference will do that as well as provide men with much needed support and encouragement
7370426 this really confirms that this pattern has been happening already
7370427 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7370428 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7370429 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7370430 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7370431 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7370432 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7370433 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately bit by bit the neolithic way of life is being revealed
7370434 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7370435 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7370436 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7370437 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
7370438 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
7370439 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 230 feet per year
7370440 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
7370441 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
7370442 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
7370443 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
7370444 the erosion has been going on for years but it is being accelerated by sea level rise so we have to act earlier than we would have had to
7370445 its about balancing the interests of the site and finding the most sensible solution
7370446 weve got to bear in mind the impacts of climate change such as increased storminess
7370447 our performance continues to be underpinned by strong support from investors both domestically and offshore from intermediaries and share brokers institutional investors and borrowing clients
7370448 this ongoing support ensures we continue to strengthen our service offering we see excellent opportunities in these areas over the next 12 months
7370449 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7370450 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7370451 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7370452 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7370453 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble

7370471 it was very intimate and both guy and madonna made vows to each other and pledged to try to make their marriage strong again the ceremony lasted about an hour they turned up at the kabbalah centre in their gym clothes and changed into white robes everyone at the centre hopes that they will get through their recent rough patch
7370472 there have been numerous inquiries to my office from within the trucking industry about the application of this new legislation
7370473 its important that drivers and trucking companies are properly informed and that the government and rta are aware of existing concerns
7370474 a phase in period has been established to ensure that the industry has time to adjust to the chain of responsibility laws which will target fatigue and speed
7370475 the fact that the state government has listened to the concerns of industry representatives and groups such as the transport workers union on this issue demonstrates the importance of attending and asking questions at these information sessions
7370476 im certainly hopeful that there will be a good turn out at the meetings in dubbo and parkes so that there is a comprehensive understanding of what the new laws entail and all sides including the rta and government are better informed of the impact
7370477 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada

7370479 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7370480 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare

7370488 the market in australia is much different than that in the u s and brand marketers continuously gravitate to traditional media outlets forgetting how successful the internet can be in targeting highly engaged audiences such as food enthusiasts
7370489 advertisers that work with gourmet ads can target consumers that value high quality food beer and wine this audience relies on long tail culinary sites for recipes ideas and other resources that satisfy their interests marketers need to reach them on the sites that they visit while they are in the right frame of mind and are thinking about food
7370490 benjamins expertise as a television presenter cookbook author and culinary educator has led to the creation of one of the most unique ad networks to date
7370491 today long tail culinary sites are being sought due to the growing interest in cooking and food in general which has not only hit the united states but other countries as well with more individuals gravitating towards the kitchen table an effective way of reaching them is through vertical ad networks that cater to the need of the culinarily engaged

7370542 p eople say well you know you all had the same intelligence that the white house had and im here to tell you that is nowhere near the truth we not only dont have nor probably should we have the presidential daily brief we dont have the constant people who are working on intelligence who are very close to him they dont release their an administration which tends not to release not just the white house but the cia dod department of defense others they control information theres a lot of intelligence that we dont get that they have

7370551 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer
7370552 the bad news is that the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown see link
7370553 and if the vaccines prove to require a booster shot as many critics believe that cost rises to 140 000 in such cases it might make more economic sense to rely on pap smear screening alone the researchers said
7370554 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
7370555 there is no need to rush if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
7370556 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
7370557 have provided money for activities by patients and womens groups doctors and medical experts lobbyists and political organizations interested in the disease sometimes in ways that skirt disclosure requirements or obscure the companies involvement
7370558 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
7370559 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
7370560 i would have liked to see it go much slower
7370561 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
7370562 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk

7370568 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
7370569 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road

7370572 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
7370573 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer

7370594 these shows are a great tradition and an important part of what we do
7370595 it is heartbreaking when you have just won a prize and you cant even take the cake home to show it off or share it with the others
7370596 most federations have a show every year or once every two years
7370597 at the national competition we took a first step by deciding that instead of making a dundee cake we would make mini dundee cakes
7370598 were a traditional institution and things are done in a traditional way but with these new rules we have to rethink
7370599 i was making a pecan pie for the federation show and it suddenly dawned on me that only a mouthful of that pie would be eaten

7370601 ramsay is targeting core eps growth of 10 12 per cent for the total group for the 2009 financial year with strong health care fundamentals and organic growth set to continue

7370612 i am mindful not only of preserving executive powers for myself but for my predecessors as well
7370613 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7370614 we didnt do the rundown very well ill give us that our rundown technique was not good
7370615 i looked up at the umpire thinking hes going to say something like are you kidding me and hes like yep yep yep right there i lost it i was like what
7370616 that was the first thing i thought of to get somebody to get close enough to where i could touch them people go how do you think of that that fast well if youre not fast you have to think of a lot of things to try to get you out of bad baserunning

7370620 vacation ideas long weekend trips we have an 8 year old boy hes into the outdoors also so we were looking for something where we could get away on the weekends not too far from where we live
7370621 i havent done the fingerlakes but i hear theyre absolutely beautiful and im looking forward to that
7370622 it gives them a central location where they can get all the information in one spot rather than calling different phone numbers getting things emailed to them they have everything right here makes it convenient
7370623 what is available from the wine trails to the adirondacks to new york city to niagara falls theres so much variety and then theyre just walking away with handfuls of booklets so they can plan a vacation based on that
7370624 by reaching out to people of faith they have shown the back of their hand to those who do not believe as they do
7370625 it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are 20 gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
7370626 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
7370627 imagine a world with no religion a world without the golden rule devoid of most charities hospitals and great universities
7370628 he had to know something to know theres a creek that runs back behind these homes
7370629 when i have my grandchildren here theyre usually in the backyard and im there with them
7370630 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7370631 what doug ruled at second base was even though a
7370632 you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7370633 he wasnt going to talk to him anymore that he was going to talk to joe
7370634 eddings thought he bumped him that willy interfered or obstructed with the runner and he gave him the extra base i disagree
7370635 its just a coincidence that its bobble day for me that it happened but its nice to have that many fans out there and win a ball game like that
7370636 i was planning on swinging at that fastball but i saw rickie take off so i figured id take it let him get to second scoring position
7370637 split finger i think he hung it a little bit and it found a hole for me
7370638 you just had the feeling getting out of that jam right there we were going to win the ball game in the bottom half of the inning
7370639 the way the game was going the flow of the game i made my mind up that if we had a runner in scoring position i was going to take a shot at trying to score that run for him and hold it to see if he could get the win
7370640 both sides left a lot of guys on base a lot of hits we just couldnt come up with the big one
7370641 bob continued to agitate the situation by coming toward our dugout and yelling
7370642 they were exchanging words we got adam pushed him down the dugout and he stopped talking and bob kept coming i didnt think it was handled right
7370643 obviously everyone knows they are two big games theyre right behind us in this wild card push
7370644 theyve played pretty good baseball too two good teams playing good baseball somebodys got to win and somebodys got to lose
7370645 obviously we can look forward to whats in front of us
7370646 being able to sweep baltimore definitely puts us in a much better situation against boston
7370647 i have a bunch of guys that just gave their hearts and souls to that game and i hope you understand that
7370648 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did thats how tough it is for me to process
7370649 i was trying to go down and away i didnt execute the pitch and big league hitters thats what theyre supposed to do
7370650 this was a big game we knew we had a chance to sweep and any time you can do that you have to take advantage of it especially where we are right now
7370651 its always nice to come home and were going to have an important series at home
7370652 weve just got to keep doing what weve been doing
7370653 when you lose the first two games of a series i think youre going to have a quick hook with anybody
7370654 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
7370655 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7370656 its inevitable that were going to use it as long as its just where home run calls and borderline calls are concerned
7370657 we just have to make sure its a system that doesnt delay the game any more
7370658 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7370659 im very blessed and very happy all the work i put into it i think its paid off but i dont want to sound selfish its not all about me its about the ballclub and winning ballgames
7370660 hes a hall of famer and he had 573 homers so he did a lot more in his career than ive done in mine so far
7370661 hes the guy whos got all the power records in our organization so to have my name next to his is pretty nice
7370662 maybe when im done playing ill look back on it as a pretty good accomplishment if we won the game it would mean a lot more
7370663 but right now were in a pennant race and were going to need more than just a hundred rbis im going to need to keep driving in runs and helping us win ballgames

7370749 the first essential step for the leader of the western alliance is to tone down the bombast and restore a dialogue with russia second we should shelve loose talk about bringing either ukraine or georgia into nato at least until we are willing to invite russia itself
7370750 nato is essentially still a cold war military pact seeking a new identity that it has not yet found admitting these two former soviet republics would be interpreted by moscow as anti russian provocation and rightly so and even if it didnt provoke a new cold war it would create serious tensions within nato itself

7370866 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
7370867 i love diversity because it presents a new picture that you can get excited about if you watch five crews and theyre absolutely amazing but they all dance in the same style they dont stand out from each other if you see a crew that brings something different to the table then you can get excited about it again
7370868 i am the mother hen because marios out there hosting and the judges cant really talk to the crews and im back there i see them cry i see them laugh they talk to me about their boyfriends and girlfriends and i really feel like i get to know them i couldnt be back there when crews would get kicked off because id start crying
7370869 i went through a phase when i was watching all the different old school musicals because at one time we were trying to evolve the dance world this was before all the tv shows came out we were trying to get new stuff and it usually comes out of the old dance movies
7370870 for two years well be going to korea then were doing the states
7370871 it may sound kind of cliche and kind of corny
7370872 but were really just trying to contribute to make the world a better place inspiring the youth they are the future
7370873 basically to help the kids to have confidence in themselves as well because thats what dance did for us thats what hip hop did for us so were trying to do that for the younger generation
7370874 i think the show is so exciting the kids are out of school in the summer its an edgy show so i wanted to get it back up fast plus we had a lot of crews that were calling asking when they could dance
7370875 theres some amazing crews that turned out this year jabbawockeez took home the trophy for season 1 but im telling you its going to be blazing hot
7370876 its always a dream to be on a show like this you know giving dancers such a big opportunity for their talents to be showcased to actually be here i dont think that anyone here including ourselves really understands and grasps how big a blessing this really is
7370877 a lot of people underestimate us by thinking were some sort of boy band which is not even close to it were gonna hopefully break that in this show
7370878 the number is completely different from what weve done in the past show
7370879 being surrounded by all these different crews of course youre going to be pushed to do something thats better than the rest
7370880 the competition is really good so well have to step up our game
7370881 when we compete internationally we compete against other b boys here were competing against different dance styles
7370882 we werent sure if it was going to work because it was so different from what everyone else was doing the concept was so out there
7370883 we were really nervous going into the show because we werent sure the people were going to get it because it was a different song it wasnt a mainstream song it was a different theme
7370884 this is actually our first time coming together its been hard weve been clashing but were getting things done
7370885 its a really level playing field i think the weak links are already gone
7370886 i think from here on out even though theres eight groups the decisions are going to get really tough its going to depend on who really breaks out i think a couple groups have had break through moments but i dont know if theyve broken out on their own to really establish themselves as being the real leader
7370887 the first episode has shown the potential of the crews and when i look at their performances and they arent on the same level its like what are you guys doing you could come harder you can do so much better your first impression is what sticks and these guys have set a wonderful first impression they just need to back that up every time
7370888 i couldve sworn last year if you asked who the finalists were going to be i wouldve said kaba modern and jabbawockeez its so tough because it really depends whos growing the most you can be an awesome dance crew but if youre not growing week to week and america isnt seeing some struggle and growth theyre not going to vote for you super cr3w is very very solid right now but if someones more hungry than them they can swoop up behind them and take the lead
7370889 what i learned from the first episode is that there are a lot of kids in the audience a lot of younger people
7370890 so what i might usually play in the club doesnt work you play a song and no matter how banging it is if they dont know it or know the video it just isnt there
7370891 what im trying to do is incorporate those with the newer stuff thats the beauty of music and hip hop right now theyre taking everything from back then so im going to take a lot of things that have been sampled and mix them so people get the lesson
7370892 every team works really hard to be where theyre at its strange because as the teams leave the tension between the crews gets bigger because its a competition were all still friends but we know were here to compete
7370893 its weird because i forget im on tv and then thirty kids will run up to me following me into a movie all that stuff its crazy
7370894 we never thought we would be here doing this and in this position right now just because b boys dont go to dance school or go to classes we do it because we love it
7370895 never give up follow your dreams set them very very high so its going to be a stress to get it and then once you get it just hold it tight and never let go
7370896 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch
7370897 dai 18 agli 80 le donne a proposito della politica e la societ
7370898 le donne sono la chiave per la vittoria alle prossime presidenziali saranno loro a dettare le fortune politiche e a riformare la struttura governativa del paese a tutti i livelli qualsiasi persona che intenda capire il panorama politico deve esaminare la mente e le motivazioni dellelettorato femminile
7370899 and she does it omg one one hundredth of a second at 3 30 am est on august 24 2008 she does it she defends her 2006 gold medal unbelievable sharon has done it for team obama and team cesob
7370900 sharon you just won 2 gold medals at these games what are you going to do now
7370901 even when its an old beater it will still be fast
7370902 mama weet dr criminele zoon komt uit de goot papa was er nie voor me en mama was te broke en niemand gaf geen moer om deze kleine neger mn liefde voor muziek en mn liefde voor paper hielden me staande in de dagen van nood zat zes keer in jilla maar mn hoofd die blijft omhoog
7370903 ik hoef niet meer te hosselen op straat nu ik ben vooral blij dat mensen kunnen zien dat iemand van de straat het kan maken en dan niet iemand die alleen dingen heeft gehoord maar iemand die heeft vastgezeten en genoeg heeft meegemaakt
7370904 we are born with the schizophrenia of good and evil within us so that each generation must persevere in self recognition and in self control in ceding to the automatic reassurance of our logic we have abandoned once more those powers of recognition and of control darkness seems scarcely different from light with the web of structure and logic woven thick across both we must therefore cut away these layers of false protection if we wish to regain control of our common sense and morality
7370905 ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free john viii 32
7370906 being persuaded that a just application of the principles on which the masonic fraternity is founded must be promotive of private virtue and public prosperity i shall always be happy to advance the interests of the society and to be considered by them a deserving brother
7370907 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
7370908 i candidly confess that i have ever looked on cuba as the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our system of states the control which with florida this island would give us over the gulf of mexico and the countries and isthmus bordering on it as well as all those whose waters flow into it would fill up the measure of our political well being
7370909 i am one of those who do not believe the national debt is a national blessing it is calculated to raise around the administration a moneyed aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of the country
7370910 in countries where associations are free secret societies are unknown in america there are factions but no conspiracies
7370911 our union is a confederation of independent states whose policy is peace with each other and all the world to enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions the world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our government
7370912 tell mother tell mother i died for my country useless useless
7370913 the united states is not a nation to which peace is a necessity
7370914 the mission of the united states is one of benevolent assimilation
7370915 when great nations fear to expand shrink from expansion it is because their greatness is coming to an end are we still in the prime of our lusty youth still at the beginning of our glorious manhood to sit down among the outworn people to take our place with the weak and the craven a thousand times no
7370916 i did not feel that one man should have all this power while others have none
7370917 in the western hemisphere the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states however reluctantly in flagrant cases of wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international police power
7370918 what this country needs what every country needs occasionally is a good hard bloody war to revive the vice of patriotism on which its existence as a nation depends
7370919 since i entered politics i have chiefly had mens views confided to me privately some of the biggest men in the united states in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
7370920 americas neutrality is ineffectual at best the world must be made safe for democracy
7370921 the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal well meaning but without understanding
7370922 the real truth of the matter is that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of andrew jackson
7370923 he may be a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch
7370924 we have undertaken a new order of things yet we progress to it under the framework and in the spirit and intent of the american constitution
7370925 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both
7370926 the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base that was because we wished in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilians
7370927 the real rulers in washington are invisible to exercise power from behind the scenes
7370928 i am considerably concerned when i see the extent to which we are developing a one party press in a two party country
7370929 we must develop effective espionage and counter espionage services and must learn to subvert sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever more sophisticated and more effective methods than those used against us it may be necessary that the american people be made acquainted with understand and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy
7370930 these men should be equipped with weapons and should march slightly behind the innocent and gullible participants
7370931 the idea that you can merchandise candidates for high office like breakfast cereal that you can gather votes like box tops is i think the ultimate indignity to the democratic process
7370932 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
7370933 now we have a problem in making our power credible and vietnam is the place
7370934 i didnt shoot anybody no sir im just a patsy
7370935 we do not want an expanding struggle with consequences that no one can perceive nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our power but we will not surrender and we will not retreat for behind our american pledge lies the determination and resources i believe of all of the american nation
7370936 the greatest purveyor of violence on earth is my own government
7370937 i now fully realize that only the powers of the presidency will reveal the secrets of my brothers death
7370938 if people demonstrate in a manner to interfere with others they should be rounded up and put in a concentration camp
7370939 when you get in these people when you get these people in say look the problem is that this will open the whole the whole bay of pigs thing and the president just feels that ah without going into the details dont dont lie to them to the extent to say there is no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it the president believes that it is going to open the whole bay of pigs thing up again and ah because these people are plugging for for keeps and that they should call the fbi in and say that we wish for the country dont go any further into this case period
7370940 if a president of the united states ever lied to the american people he should resign
7370941 always give your best never get discouraged never by petty always remember others may hate you those who hate you dont win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself
7370942 the more i have learned the more concerned i have become that the government was involved in the assassination of president john f kennedy
7370943 we should live our lives as though christ were coming this afternoon
7370944 we do not seek to intimidate but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people
7370945 the two party system has given this country the war of lyndon johnson the watergate of nixon and the incompetence of carter saying we should keep the two party system simply because it is working is like saying the titanic voyage was a success because a few people survived on life rafts
7370946 the shah of iran was despite the travesties of retroactive myth a dedicated reformer
7370947 there is solid evidence that hoffa marcello and trafficante three of the most important targets for criminal prosecution by the kennedy administration had discussions with their subordinates about murdering president kennedy associates of hoffa trafficante and marcello were in direct contact with jack ruby the dallas nightclub owner who killed the lone assassin of the president although members of the warren commission which investigated president kennedys assassination has knowledge of much of this information at the time of their inquiry they chose not to follow it up
7370948 we love your adherence to democratic principle and to the democratic processes
7370949 vietnam was the first war ever fought without any censorship without censorship things can get terribly confused in the public mind
7370950 the defense policy of the united states is based on a simple premise the united states does not start fights we will never be an aggressor we maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression to preserve freedom and peace
7370951 they are our brothers these freedom fighters they are the moral equal of our founding fathers and the brave men and women of the french resistance we cannot turn away from them for the struggle here is not right versus left it is right versus wrong
7370952 i never said i had no idea about most of the things you said i said i had no idea about
7370953 i will never apologize for the united states of america i dont care what the facts are
7370954 the world can therefore seize the opportunity to fulfill the long held promise of a new world order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind
7370955 thats the left wing of the cia debating the right wing of the cia
7370956 based on the evidence that ive been shown i would think that it would be very difficult for something of that magnitude to occur on his lbjs watch and he not be privy to it
7370957 further the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
7370958 this crusade this war on terrorism is going to take a while
7370959 i think skull and bones has had slightly more success than the mafia in the sense that the leaders of the five families are all doing 100 years in jail and the leaders of the skull and bones families are doing four and eight years in the white house
7370960 you know one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect iraq to the war on terror
7370961 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7370962 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7370963 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7370964 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7370965 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7370966 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7370967 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7370968 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7370969 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7370970 filled screens around the stage as she left on friday night but her energetic performance which including skipping pole dancing and break dancing would seem to suggest her career is anything but madonna sealed her position as queen of pop by entering the millennium stadium cardiff on a throne in a glittering black givenchy outfit before revisiting classic looks and hits during a two hour set the only thing some fans could be rightly disappointed with was a lack of controversy after her last tour saw her suspended on a crucifix the diverse production was not without drama however with britney spears making a much anticipated appearance on a video screen a film of cctv style footage showed her trapped in a lift wearing dark glasses and a hooded top express yourself dont repress yourself
7370971 its marvellous shes made it to 50 now and shes still going as long as she keeps on doing the shows well keep on coming i cant believe that shes only playing in cardiff and london out of everywhere in the uk im really pleased about it its good to have wales recognised

7370978 anyone could write what i write and would receive the same compliments and inspire the same confidence but we can be of use to the church by prayer and sacrifice such correspondences should be allowed rarely and denied altogether to those nuns who would think too much about it they would imagine they were doing wonders whereas they would only be harm ing their own souls and might be deceived by the wiles of the devil
7370979 do not forget what i say as time goes on for it is most important we must not mint false coin at carmel with which to buy souls how often the fine letters one writes and that one receives in return are nothing more than an exchange of worthless coin

7371010 there is no evidence to show there were taliban there that night
7371011 it is quite obvious the americans bombed the area due to wrong information
7371012 i am 100 percent confident that someone gave the information due to a tribal dispute the americans are foreigners and they do not understand these people they killed were enemies of the taliban
7371013 leave me alone get out of here you ugly little biting thing

7371022 is totally amicable with the other girls she just wants to continue on with her solo career there is no animosity there is nothing negative
7371023 ok group truth you could possibly maybe be unbearably light still as a collective with youre group story but does this make a dent in being does make lightness heaviness
7371024 those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent
7371025 i realized that i was part of a family that had been around when this earth was formed from matter in the heavens and i understood how this family had been organized
7371026 i understood perfectly my role as a woman and felt absolutely comfortable with it
7371027 i was shown how vital a womans role is to the exaltation of our heavenly family
7371028 i also understood the role and position of men and while i dont recall as much about that i do remember being shown that while the roles of men and women are not the same and never have been each is totally indispensable to the other
7371029 finally i had a perfect understanding of the necessity of both men and women respecting each others roles this respect is important for our eternal growth which is enhanced by our helping each other with these divine responsibilities any time a man degrades a woman or a woman degrades a man whether sexually physically emotionally or spiritually through cruelty and abuse posing for or viewing pornography practicing prostitution or what have you such an individuals spirituality is diminished and their divine role remains unfulfilled
7371030 then he allowed me to see into his light and i saw him and he looked like a man we are truly made in the image of our creator
7371031 his appearance was one of great wisdom and strength he was powerful looking and very tall much taller than the average man the robe he wore shone with a pure white light and he wore no shoes there was a neat fringe of white hair around his head and a crown of light suspended above his head his face was very kind and loving yet strong and marked with authority as i stared at him i was filled with awe and humility but i also felt safe and very loved
7371032 gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose
7371033 there were no national distinctions among those premortal spirits such as americans europeans asiatics australians etc such bounds of habitation would have to be determined when the spirits entered their earthly existence or second estate
7371034 while one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy the great parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard he views them as his offspring and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men causes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
7371035 there were no races in that premortal realm in fact my memory of my experience is that the only skin color in that realm is light for every being i saw was somehow made up to one degree or another out of light yet there was substance to this light for there was definitely substance to my own being i knew too that this light was spiritual and though i understood this perfectly while i was there im at a loss to know how to explain it now ni ether can i explain the purpose of the various races her in mortality save my assumption that they are all part of the divine plan to teach us how to love each other
7371036 when i was in heaven i never saw different races of people only spirit beings who were filled with love for each other we are all the same race in heaven before we come to earth god chooses what our earthly race will be he makes that decision for our spiritual growth and according to his perfect plan on earth many people are prejudiced and sometimes even violent toward others who are different people of color the poor alcoholics and addicts or those with physical or mental disabilities but in heaven it is considered a great honor for a spirit to accept such a difficult life
7371037 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7371038 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders
7371039 while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become
7371040 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7371041 contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation
7371042 ive just given permission to turn off the piece this will undoubtedly fuel a whole new cycle
7371043 with time and age you will discover more of yourself look at your family study your dna this is where youll find the things to influence and bolster your writing

7371045 i have often come across people in my community who are going through something in their lives whether it be sickness recovery a birth that has overcome great odds an adoption and my automatic response to those stories is that i want to reach out to them and offer them a photography session free of charge of course
7371046 if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations it is this i was here i was young i was happy and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picure

7371121 because defendants did not satisfy their duty to preserve even after this lawsuit was filed and recklessly allowed the destruction of some relevant source code as late as 2004
7371122 there is no doubt that a litigant has a duty to preserve evidence it knows or should know is relevant to imminent litigation

7371143 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7371144 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7371145 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7371146 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority of those polled rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7371147 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7371163 you dont have to know anything about dungeons and dragons or roleplaying games to get the movie have fun and laugh hard if you are familiar with the subject matter it will be that much funnier we really focused on making this movie accessible for everyone so we can widen our fan base its a real character movie that moves well and really shows you what playing roleplaying games are like the first movie was more like a series of sketches strung together we might revisit that model later in another movie but for dorkness the character narrative was the next logical step for us

7371170 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7371171 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7371172 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7371173 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7371174 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7371175 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere
7371176 the show has definitely increased peoples awareness about swimming between the flags but people i talk to who arent involved with lifeguarding or surf orientated are always surprised at how many idiots there are out there who are still willing to risk their lives by not taking some basic advice

7371187 abbiamo giocato una bellissima partita ma mi piaciuta anche la roma chi dice che qui il calcio non spettacolare servito se si gioca come abbiamo fatto tutti questa sera in italia si raggiungono livelli eccelsi
7371188 era ora visto che dagli 11 metri in passato ho avuto grosse delusioni con il porto e col chelsea ma ripeto ho potito disputare questa finale perch un altro allenatore un grande innamorato di questo gioco ha centrato lo scudetto prima di me
7371189 la roma lavora da anni con lo stesso mister ama giocare con la palla ai piedi e noi nei primi 45 abbiamo fatto cose super poi nella ripresa sono stati bravi i giallorossi ma con balotelli cambiando tattica abbiamo di nuovo fatto bene per per me doveva finire 2 1 per noi senza il pareggio forse casuale andavamo tutti a casa al 90 senza soffrire ma il calcio questo comunque nei 30 supplementari ho detto ai miei di evitare sforzi e rischi e giocare con la testa e di non aver paura sui rigori

7371201 what i dont like is the view of entitlement that redshirting brings of if i am not going to play i am going to redshirt
7371202 but just because a player is on the team for one year and doesnt play doesnt mean that year is a year he is going to have back eligibility wise
7371203 we arent going to make any decisions on redshirts right now probably not until the last week of practice before utah plays michigan
7371204 were going to use anyone who can help us out
7371205 the hardest thing is you work your hardest and you think you are doing a good job and they tell you at the end of camp

7371207 he has a good purpose in mind which is to help people move along in school rather than messing around taking their time filling classes because they know they have five years to graduate
7371208 close to the end of camp coach mendenhall came to me and said hey we feel as a coaching staff that it would be best for you to redshirt this year get totally healthy and come back
7371209 i am sure the coaching staff will deal with it in a way that is positive for the players and still gives them their best experience possible
7371210 it might make guys appreciate having a scholarship and it might make guys appreciate having a redshirt year
7371211 coach mendenhall just wants guys to help the team he wants guys that come in every day and work their tail off to get better

7371236 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7371237 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7371238 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7371239 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7371240 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7371241 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7371242 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7371243 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7371244 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7371245 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7371246 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7371247 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7371248 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7371249 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7371250 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7371251 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7371252 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7371253 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7371254 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7371255 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7371256 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7371257 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7371258 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7371259 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7371260 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7371261 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7371262 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7371263 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7371264 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7371265 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7371266 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7371267 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here

7371287 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7371288 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7371289 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7371290 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7371291 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7371292 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7371293 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7371294 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7371295 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7371296 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7371297 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7371298 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7371299 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7371300 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7371301 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7371302 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7371303 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7371304 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7371305 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7371306 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7371307 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7371308 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7371309 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7371310 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7371311 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7371312 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7371313 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7371314 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7371315 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7371316 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7371317 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7371318 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7371319 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7371320 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7371321 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7371322 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7371323 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7371324 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7371325 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7371326 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7371327 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7371328 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7371329 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7371330 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7371331 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7371332 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7371333 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7371334 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7371335 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7371336 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7371337 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7371338 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7371339 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7371340 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7371341 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7371342 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7371343 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7371344 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7371345 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7371346 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7371347 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7371348 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7371349 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7371350 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7371351 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7371352 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7371353 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7371354 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7371355 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7371356 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7371357 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7371358 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7371359 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7371360 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7371361 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7371362 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7371363 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7371364 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7371365 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7371366 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7371367 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7371368 just think how many potholes could be patched with the money spent on this so called improvement
7371369 seconds count its just like putting barricades in the street its ridiculous
7371370 but what were doing is whats best for the city and whats best for the neighborhood
7371371 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7371372 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7371373 its not impacting that many of our folks thank goodness
7371374 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7371375 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7371376 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7371377 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7371378 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7371379 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7371380 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7371381 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7371382 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7371383 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7371384 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7371385 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7371386 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7371387 h uman activity affecting the atmosphere is very likely an important driving factor
7371388 it might be about 1 5 degrees warmer at the end of this century
7371389 but global warming as proclaimed by al gore and co is a hoax
7371390 it should also be remembered that science is based on facts not consensus
7371391 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7371392 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7371393 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7371394 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7371395 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7371396 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7371397 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7371398 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7371399 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7371400 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7371401 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7371402 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7371403 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7371404 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7371405 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7371406 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7371407 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7371408 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7371409 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7371410 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7371411 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7371412 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7371413 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7371414 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7371415 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7371416 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7371417 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7371418 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7371419 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7371420 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7371421 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7371422 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7371423 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7371424 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7371425 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7371426 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7371427 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7371428 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7371429 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7371430 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7371431 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7371432 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7371433 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7371434 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7371435 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7371436 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7371437 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7371438 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7371439 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7371440 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7371441 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7371442 when there arent identifiable pieces sometimes we dont know right away what was working and what wasnt working
7371443 when there arent identifiable pieces sometimes we dont know right away what was working and what wasnt working

7371453 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7371454 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7371455 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7371456 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7371457 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7371458 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7371459 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7371460 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7371461 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7371462 id like to move to bali please tell me how to go about it

7371467 virtually every single one of our international sports were either invented or codified by the british and i say this respectfully to our chinese hosts who have excelled so magnificently at ping pong
7371468 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and it was called wiff waff
7371469 there i think you have the essential difference between us and the rest of world
7371470 other nations the french looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play wiff waff that is why london is the sporting capital of the world
7371471 and i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home

7371517 it was a beautiful day with perfect weather and people were getting super pupmed definitely one of the wildest crowds ive played for the audience had been real rowdy all day long and by the time i hit the stage they were ready to explode it was amazing i was loving the energy and intensity but the production crew decided to stop my set for fear of a full blown riot thank you to all the juggalos and juggalettes for going all out and partying with me it was a real pleasure to be around so many energetic people ill never forget the day for as long as i live

7371609 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
7371610 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
7371611 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
7371612 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
7371613 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
7371614 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
7371615 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
7371616 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
7371617 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
7371618 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
7371619 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
7371620 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
7371621 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
7371622 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
7371623 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
7371624 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
7371625 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face

7371632 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7371633 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7371743 its something thats not spoken about a lot its hidden people care but they dont care
7371744 being a woman of color it saddens me that african american women account for so much of the prison population
7371745 gender based discrimination and misogyny are not exclusive to the congo their manifestations exist everywhere
7371746 i know people who are my age and younger who are getting pregnant
7371747 my mom doesnt like talking about things like that i wanted people to know that they should be talking about it
7371748 i come from a working class neighborhood and i know all too well the results of going to jail children lose mothers and fathers and a lot of times they grow up without any real guidance
7371749 yea yea yea gardasil ads seem all positive on tv and hooray for those who want to become one less theres no shame in your game ladies but we should not allow advertisement to suck us in like a load of fools
7371750 not everyone is being vaccinated and i am not the queen of the world pointing you in the direction to go be vaccinated if you choose but be aware of what it is that you are getting into
7371751 youre not reading only for you this could speak to someone else
7371752 im not going to say i want to change the world to tell you the truth i write cuz its therapeutic my goal is to reach out to those who may not be as strong to talk about their feelings to write about it
7371753 ive never seen anything like this not just peers who have the same love of writing but also adults that help spur us to get to a higher level i just wanted to do anything to stay in this environment
7371754 she was like a walking dead person not even a person
7371755 there was no personhood no personality like the soul had been removed
7371756 our federal public policies have always focused on the womans willingness
7371757 forget about her willingness whether she had a gun to her head or three guys who put her in a sack and shipped her off to canada
7371758 its about them the guys out there who are preying on the most vulnerable people
7371759 its not as sexy a topic as international trafficking but we have a lot more trafficking going on domestically than we want to admit to
7371760 what this bill does is it finally addresses whats really happening not what wed like to think is happening
7371761 youre taking people that are totally needy and you are promising a roof over their head and money
7371762 the same thing that happens in developing countries happens in our own low income communities
7371763 many of our sample came from horrible family backgrounds that they ran away from
7371764 what hit me was that they were so disconnected so isolated they had this relationship with this pimp and that was it they were just this sad little island
7371765 they dont necessarily kidnap you knock you on the head and put a rag in your mouth
7371766 its easier to arrest 10 of them sex workers than infiltrate a ring of traffickers
7371767 and you always take the shortest distance between two points the government will probably manipulate the law because in history thats what theyve done with us
7371768 you have to understand the difference between someone who is using sex as a legitimate income and a 14 year old girl who is being exploited
7371769 the bill is very very clear that its only going to prosecute third parties
7371770 i think lack of resources is a poor reason for opposing something that should be done
7371771 you have to decide where youre going to put the manpower to work
7371772 its difficult to go after gang bangers and international drug cartels but we still have to do it
7371773 the way we handle prostitution is we respond to complaints by districts
7371774 people call 911 and say theres a prostitute on my street come and get her the street is cheap its 10 bucks a sex act the real money is in these indoor venues
7371775 these kinds of things whether theyre gentlemens clubs or massage parlors blend into the community theyre in and people dont really recognize whats going on
7371776 as soon as things get hot they traffickers and pimps have these vans and they can pack up their people and theyre gone
7371777 they are well organized we are the disorganized ones they are years ahead of us
7371778 i happen to know that when the police squeeze here in chicago pimps go right down to joliet
7371779 they had no childhood so they cant go back home what do you build on where do you start
7371780 theres very little safe housing specifically for prostitutes so a lot of times they leave the placement out of fear and go back to their pimps its not worth the risk for them
7371781 i dont think law enforcement can go after the trafficker or the pimp
7371782 im all for giving law enforcement every tool that they need to go after every wrong doer but i dont think you can arrest and prosecute without the testimony of the girls that have been trafficked and its a very dangerous thing for those girls
7371783 its about offering opportunity in these low income communities and getting it to all of these people at all levels
7371784 the community in turn has to be the one to blow the whistle they know who these traffickers are and they have to turn on them
7371785 if the domestic issues had been removed from the bill it probably would have sailed right through
7371786 as if trafficking is a problem out there not in here
7371787 these girls are not going to mexico theyre not going to europe
7371788 theyre being shipped around this country and thats what i think is a huge step forward in this bill the rest of the world has recognized this for years we havent
7371789 humiliation degradation and fear of death on a daily basis id say thats a human rights issue
7371790 ericssons research suggests a third clich as well when it comes to choosing a life path you should do what you love because if you dont love it you are unlikely to work hard enough to get very good most people naturally dont like to do things they arent good at so they often give up telling themselves they simply dont possess the talent for math or skiing or the violin but what they really lack is the desire to be good and to undertake the deliberate practice that would make them better
7371791 nine tenths of the laws passed every winter at the federal capitol and all the state capitols are not only unneeded laws but positive nuisances jobs got up for the service of special classes or persons
7371792 the kind of people who survive in the game of politics long enough to become president are almost necessarily pathological liars
7371793 i cant tell you how many times i had to sit next to my dad and tell him its gonna be ok when you know its not i dont want to lie to people i love and i dont want any kid to go through what i had to go through

7371868 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7371869 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7371870 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

7371872 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7371873 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7371874 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7371875 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7371876 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7371877 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7371878 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7371879 who are open to doing something on the production side
7371880 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7371881 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7371882 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7371883 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7371884 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7371885 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7371886 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7371887 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7371888 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7371889 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7371890 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7371891 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7371892 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7371893 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7371894 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7371895 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7371896 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7371897 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7371898 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7371899 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7371900 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7371901 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7371902 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7371903 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7371904 we want you to choose something you really would like for your home
7371905 i had to have injections for my neck and luckily i have got a great doctor and a great team or i might not have made it
7371906 as it was it was pretty tough in the race and i had a lot of pain but i dont think i lost any time in the race because of it i never lose time
7371907 i have had a miserable weekend really from the day i arrived i have a lot of flu symptoms a fever every day
7371908 i have had low energy just felt poorly with problems with the spasms in my neck which led to me being in doubt for the weekend and obviously for this race
7371909 there just isnt enough drinking water inside the car and it has been hot all the time we are inside the cars in these suits and it is like driving in a sauna
7371910 my songs have slowed down a little bit my new record is taking longer because of her but i say all of this happily
7371911 while i can t maybe produce as much music while i m caring for her she doesn t just take my energy she gives it all back
7371912 what are we going to do with all this stuff
7371913 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7371914 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7371915 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7371916 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7371917 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7371918 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7371919 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7371920 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7371921 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7371922 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7371923 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7371924 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7371925 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7371926 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7371927 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7371928 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7371929 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7371930 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7371933 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7371934 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7371935 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7371936 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7371937 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7371938 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7371939 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7371940 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7371941 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7371942 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7371943 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7371944 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7371945 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7371946 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7371947 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7371948 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7371949 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7371950 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7371951 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7371952 he is the subject of jokes and he jokes himself about his clumsiness with words but his mispronunciations and malapropisms suggest a mind of half learned language that is eerily compatible with his indifference to truth his disdain for knowledge as a foundation of a democratic society
7371953 im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman
7371954 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
7371955 i think it was in the rose garden where i issued this brilliant statement if i had a magic wand but the president doesnt have a magic wand
7371956 the economy is growing productivity is high trade is up people are working its not as good as wed like but and to the extent that we find weakness well move
7371957 throughout our history the words of the declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores these immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation of more than 300 people
7371958 should the iranian regime do they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power so like if i were you thats what id ask me and the answer is yes they do
7371959 but oftentimes im asked why why do you care what happens outside of america
7371960 i remember meeting a mother of a child who was abducted by the north koreans right here in the oval office
7371961 i want to tell you how proud i am to be the president of a nation that in which theres a lot of philippine americans they love america and they love their heritage and i reminded the president that i am reminded of the great talent of the of our philippine americans when i eat dinner at the white house
7371962 and i unfortunately have been to too many disasters as president
7371963 there is some who say that perhaps freedom is not universal maybe its only western people that can self govern maybe its only you know white guy methodists who are capable of self government i reject that notion
7371964 weve got a lot of relations with countries in our neighborhood
7371965 one of the things important about history is to remember the true history
7371966 theres no question this is a major human disaster that requires a strong response from the chinese government which is what theyre providing but it also responds a compassionate response from nations to whom that have got the blessings good blessings of life and thats us
7371967 lets make sure that there is certainty during uncertain times in our economy
7371968 we got plenty of money in washington what we need is more priority
7371969 contemporary ballet theatre and choreographer who did interesting productions to classical music and jazz and promised to teach us to dance
7371970 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7371971 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7371972 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7371973 aunque sea medio a cero y sobre la hora pero hay que ganar
7371974 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7371975 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7371976 weve always had to overcome this idea that were not big enough or important enough to even be part of the national political landscape
7371977 that was part of the idea behind wanting to get the convention in the first place if people see colorado and the western spirit theyll get past all of that
7371978 there are some security measures in place that will be seen and some that will be unseen
7371979 we have a subcommittee to address any possible thing that can happen
7371980 the city keeps coming up with new restrictions on us and we figure out ways to get around them thats how its going to go until one of us gets the last word
7371981 be cool to catch up i know your busy so just whenever
7371982 sabbath gives the world the energy it needs to exist for another six days
7371983 god some things broke this week some things were torn apart i took some hits i have some bruises and i need you to put it back together
7371984 i can only pray for 5 minutes and then i get distracted
7371985 loop je gevaar ja als je dat niet aandurft dan moet je hier niet komen
7371986 we have only made initial inquiries and greg has been too concerned about the girl and said he will come and see me first thing in the morning to tell me more
7371987 the gap between telstra market will close over time if pay increases are policy based
7371988 it shows that as a result of the collective agreement that telstras average pay is the best in the industry but the company wants to reduce the gap by offering smaller wage increases
7371989 it shows primarily the aim of the game is to reduce labour costs and that means people are going to have a reduction in their take home pay and their conditions of employment
7371990 telstra is a real live example of the need for a proper collective bargaining regime to be in place telstra has been prepared to flout the decision of the australian people last year thats why we need the legislation in place as quickly as possible so we at least ensure telstra is required to bargain in good faith they havent done that
7371991 we have always said we will protect those for existing employees thats exactly what well do
7371992 this doesnt have to happen its definitely an epidemic across the country
7371993 biking was something we grew up doing and i loved it
7371994 ive always had this desire to see the country and it made sense to make a spectacle out of biking across the u s to make sure that these accidents which are totally avoidable are now avoided
7371995 this is somebodys life were talking about theres no need to put us at risk just for being on the bike
7371996 its really about sharing the road both cyclists and drivers need to work together to keep each other safe
7371997 breathed new life into the cias terror interrogation program that would allow harsh questioning of subjects limited in public by only a vaguely worded ban on cruel and inhuman treatment
7371998 the united states should reduce its forces in iraq or remove them altogether
7371999 by a large margin americans trust the democrats rather than the president to find a solution to a conflict that remains enormously unpopular
7372000 now republicans are using a filibuster to block us from even voting on an amendment that could bring the war to a responsible end
7372001 they are protecting the president rather than protecting our troops they are denying us an up or down yes or no vote on the most important issue our country faces
7372002 it is without doubt going to be the most fiercely competitive back end of the year weve ever had
7372003 those in power need checks and restraints lest they come to identify the common good for their own tastes and desires and their continuation in office as essential to the preservation of the nation
7372004 oh my god what is that come see this oh my god what is that
7372005 there are some people mentally that can handle it there are some people who just cant you need to know when to say enough is enough
7372006 were all hard chargers were not there to mess around so we took it as an insult
7372007 it seemed like everybody in midtown just dumped into the streets
7372008 it was mayhem nobody knew what to do everyone got outside and was yelling
7372009 88 of voters who disapproved of the retiring presidents job performance voted against his partys nominee in past elections on average 80 of voters who disapproved of a presidents performance have voted against his partys candidates even in house races since 1986
7372010 whos trying to bring back the constitution insted of re writing it
7372011 japanese common sense cannot take the measure of north koreas uniqueness
7372012 for example kim came to tokyo six times in the 1980s
7372013 someone who was in contact with a kim family member told me he heard the family member say theres been a promise not to decide on kims successor so long as the current shogun is alive
7372014 if kim were alive the family member would simply have said the shogun not the current shogun the stress on current seems to suggest that the person in question is someone other than kim jong il
7372015 today were not just burying the n word were taking it out of our spirit
7372016 we gather burying all the things that go with the n word we have to bury the pimps and the hos that go with it
7372017 die n word and we dont want to see you round here no more
7372018 all presidential events must be ticketed or accessed by a name list this is the best method for preventing demonstrators people who are obviously going to try to disrupt the event can be denied entrance at least to the vip area between the stage and the main camera platform it is important to have your volunteers at a checkpoint before the magnetometers in order to stop a demonstrator from getting into the event look for signs they may be carrying and if need be have volunteers check for folded cloth signs that demonstrators may be bringing

7372021 i was a little skeptical myself but to honest with you it went really well
7372022 its mostly stand up fighting and its a lot of action
7372023 you cant start fighting just one guy you have to be prepared on both sides
7372024 its wild as soon as they start getting some better quality athletes theyll really have something
7372025 japanese common sense cannot take the measure of north koreas uniqueness
7372026 for example kim came to tokyo six times in the 1980s
7372027 someone who was in contact with a kim family member told me he heard the family member say theres been a promise not to decide on kims successor so long as the current shogun is alive
7372028 if kim were alive the family member would simply have said the shogun not the current shogun the stress on current seems to suggest that the person in question is someone other than kim jong il
7372029 it was too short for me i wanted it to last longer

7372065 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7372066 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7372067 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7372068 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7372069 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7372070 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem

7372086 the more i read about him the more intrigued i was about the story
7372087 many people have written a little bit about tom coolon and in a lot of it the truth has been extended which makes it difficult to determine what is fact and what is fiction
7372088 every tom dick and harry all had their own version of events and bits have been taken out and added in over time
7372089 most of the information i need is located at the state archives in brisbane which makes things difficult
7372090 the whole research thing has been difficult due to where i live i cant just pop down to the library
7372091 a lot of info has started on the net and then followed up with phone calls
7372092 i have tried talking to people but most of the people that know the most about this man and his era have all passed on
7372093 the bitumen shoulders are deteriorating which narrows the usable road surface a road train costs about 1m to put on the road and the maintenance costs are five times more expensive on a dirt road than on bitumen roads
7372094 i think it is probably inevitable one of these days we will have a tanker splitting and have a spill there is now a lot of chemicals moving over the tanami road
7372095 i cant think of any way to expand gasoline production under existing conditions
7372096 that would put a pretty significant dent in the drought
7372097 its looking the best that it has in quite in while
7372098 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7372099 we need to sit down with the olympic governing bodies and work through where we anticipate where we could be in 2012 but theres no athlete or sport that is not coming back inspired and wanting to raise the sights and asking how can we do better
7372100 it will be a tough ask to keep pace with the chinese or the americans but we have been right there with the russians and i think most of us are really going to be inspired to beat them in 2012 there is a possibility to finish third but we need to review the position before we make a firm commitment
7372101 we need a four year funding programme in place now to allow the olympic governing bodies to contract coaches and performance directors at the high market rate many of them demand
7372102 i would very much like to hear the prime minister underwrite the funding programme i know that they are minded to look at that and be supportive of the team but i hope that as soon as possible the government will be in a position to back the athletes
7372103 the question of prize money is under consideration we are aware that the americans do it and the australians do it but if we do go down this road we will look at the possibility of prize money for coaches as well as athletes
7372104 i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it

7372107 on behalf of the european commission i want to congratulate the hundreds of european athletes who have participated in the beijing olympic games
7372108 the past two weeks have provided european athletes with yet another opportunity to show themselves at their best and they have certainly not disappointed millions of supporters
7372109 european athletes have not only delivered excellence in competitions as testified in the individual achievements of each participating countries but they have also demonstrated that team work and fair play are key values to the sporting community of our continent and to all europeans

7372113 not just because of its massive scale but due to the extremely sensitive nature of the information

7372117 economic growth is not strong enough to support job growth
7372118 we in america today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land the poor house is vanishing from among us we have not yet reached the goal but given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years we shall soon with the help of god be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation
7372119 the most painful and frustrating economic policy blunder of the past 50 years was the great inflation of the 1970s
7372120 and far in excess of the 2 4 range during the last two decades further wages increases have been declining in both 2007 and 2008 and are currently at the lowest level 3 4 since late 2005 wheres the wage inflation
7372121 i keep my angst here i preserve it because i need it it keeps me sharp on the edge where i gotta be

7372123 to actually pull it off is a pretty amazing accomplishment
7372124 to sign a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux
7372125 because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories
7372126 it is important to note that the effects of the intrusion on fedora and red hat are not the same
7372127 accordingly the fedora package signing key is not connected to and is different from the one used to sign red hat enterprise linux packages and vice versa

7372134 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7372135 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7372136 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7372137 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble

7372146 our performance continues to be underpinned by strong support from investors both domestically and offshore from intermediaries and share brokers institutional investors and borrowing clients
7372147 this ongoing support ensures we continue to strengthen our service offering we see excellent opportunities in these areas over the next 12 months
7372148 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7372149 sometimes these doubts are cast but i would suggest some americans could look at themselves first they had cheats in 2000 marion jones and cheats in 2004 so they think no one wins without cheating
7372150 why is the emphasis on that fellow and not for example on eight gold medal winner michael phelps both those guys are just freakish athletes
7372151 i went down there to open it in 2005 but since then there hasnt been the political will to fund it

7372168 it was a classified government database but as far as the effects of the alleged corruption of the database i cant discuss that any further
7372169 what i find odd is that is a very serious offence but they are being allowed to continue to serve
7372170 im surprised they havent been suspended from duty or put on administrative leave
7372171 ive seen it often enough where theyre very quick to charge people
7372172 made a stabbing motion and i could see his arms cutting
7372173 joe was asking him questions where did he get the phone was he placing ieds was he taliban
7372174 he basically said master sgt newell had a screw loose
7372175 he told me dont worry nothing will come of it
7372176 i tried to quit on my own but i couldnt go to people in the academy for help because i was afraid they would prosecute me
7372177 he told me how could a woman love me or have children with me
7372178 the sentencing is more for a predator not a voyeur
7372179 they were the sort of images that were demeaning and of ruinous behavior
7372180 he was a decent young man who led a good life but was afflicted with this disorder
7372181 he was a very capable young man and then when i found out i was devastated
7372182 weve been receiving e mails from my brother so we knew it was coming
7372183 article 32 hearing at a u s base near tikrit iraq on the charges an article 32 hearing comparable to a preliminary hearing in civilian courts is held to determine whether a full trial is warranted
7372184 we called the platoon leader and the response was are they dead yet
7372185 he said on the tape which was played during a pretrial hearing last month
7372186 we argued about it but we had to move we had to get out our unit ismoving down the street i did one guy
7372187 they were going to run down the streetand grab an assault rifle because they had them stashed
7372188 im not doing all this by myself youre doing one and weemer is doing one
7372189 he shot him and the dude was on the ground and rolling and weemer was shooting shooting shooting shooting shooting
7372190 louise at potted frog who always has a bright outlook on the things in life she is an avid visitor who always has a kind comment and her posts maybe long but they are always good
7372191 its national madge is going to post every day for the next 37 days month which is more than a month but what the hell its my blog month or namaigotopoevdafothne37damowhismothamobuwhtheheitmyblmo
7372192 advance and never halt for advancing is perfection advance and do not fear the thorns in the path for they draw only corrupt blood
7372193 to prove this point i could name the names of significant jews who play a prominent role in social justice issues in our society we all know them and recognize that even though our jewish community is about 2 of america jewish names abound in the most public of roles including significant causes and elected offices in government in our neshomas we get nachas that certain joy when one of our own makes an important contribution to make our america better in rabbinic terms we call that a kiddush hashem which is that we bring sanctity to gods name when we do good
7372194 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7372195 i think it s going to be at the very least spectacular
7372196 i can t go on speaking in superlatives but it all looks better than i would have thought possible
7372197 i can t imagine a better cast and the sets and costumes are just astounding
7372198 we simply want respect for our state for our people for our values
7372199 people gather to support our fraternal ukrainian nation which is groaning under the pressure of nato
7372200 of course ukraine is easy to split it is two different countries
7372201 the easts economy depends on russia the wests depends on europe the east is russian speaking and orthodox and the west is ukrainian speaking and roman catholic
7372202 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7372203 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7372204 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7372205 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7372206 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7372207 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7372208 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7372209 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7372210 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7372211 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7372212 russia has not yet fulfilled its commitment to the six point peace plan
7372213 do any of you believe in freedom of speech do you care to comment on that
7372214 now im going to have to shut this off that isnt necessary
7372215 your not talking to me why dont you believe in freedom of speech
7372216 lets listen to what these anti obama protesters have to say
7372217 this is out of control these ruffian leftists are unavoidably encompassing me and potentially cursing
7372218 we strongly suspect that the missing are on the lower reaches of the glacier underneath the lumps of serac pillar of ice which means we cant really do anything
7372219 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7372220 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7372221 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7372222 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7372223 i wasnt completely submerged i was able to help the others
7372224 you know its the mountain its like an accident on the road this isnt the first and it wont be the last
7372225 the political process has not been able to defuse the situation and now were at a very critical point where we have a very disturbing communal divide
7372226 a matter of almost trifling significance has been allowed to swell
7372227 the government was simply out of sync with the mood in kashmir the implications of the land transfer on the psyche of the people in kashmir and the impact of the revocation on hindus
7372228 has wiped out the huge gains made politically in the region in the last seven to eight years
7372229 governments inept handling and the bjps cynical exploitation of the crisis
7372230 what militants failed to do in kashmir since 1989 the government and the bjp have achieved for them
7372231 illustrated its ineptitude in the casual manner in which it watched without intervening
7372232 suitability for all kinds of activities that it has said that it wants to be a part of
7372233 ultimately the syrian leadership has to chose between the path of peace negotiation and reconciliation and iran hizbullah and hamas we hope that they chose the path of peace but our eyes are wide open and we are closely following all developments
7372234 fundamental promise to provide an effective system to protect states against violators of the peace has not been kept
7372235 no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide is causing catastrophic
7372236 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7372237 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7372238 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7372239 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7372240 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7372241 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7372242 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7372243 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7372244 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7372245 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7372246 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7372247 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7372248 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7372249 i briefed the minister about the developments there in vienna
7372250 what should have been a good game for us turned into a not so good game
7372251 silly girl youre not starring in some kind of fairytale
7372252 step right up step right up come behold the key to your deepest unknown fantasies
7372253 it is explosive it is exclusive just absolutely scandalous this has got to be the best thing next to dan browns da vinci code
7372254 im here to offer you a once in a life time chance of happiness
7372255 ive had a great relationship in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7372256 cease your aggression and join us in peace or bring your war like attitude to outer space and we will turn your world into a burned out cinder
7372257 the sons of god saw that the women of men were fair and mated with them and there were great men of renown in those days
7372258 ya tuhanku oleh sebab engkau telah memutuskan kesesatan padaku pasti aku akan menjadikan mereka memandang baik perbuatan buruk di bumi dan pasti aku akan menyesatkan mereka
7372259 sesungguhnya kalian melakukan perbuatan perbuatan yang dalam pandangan mata kalian lebih halus dari rambut tapi kami di zaman rasulullah menganggap perbuatan perbuatan tersebut termasuk dalam dosa besar
7372260 ya se est n poniendo de acuerdo con felipe calder n y est n preparando el escenario para que se imponga una reforma privatizadora pero se trata de un asunto que no van a resolver ellos solos porque se trata de un tema en el que est involucrado todo el pueblo de m xico
7372261 voy a convocar a todo el pueblo de m xico a una movilizaci n nacional a una resistencia civil pac fica porque no vamos a permitir ni un albazo ni un madruguete legislativo que est encaminado a aprobar modificaciones a leyes secundarias o a la ley reglamentaria del art culo 27 constitucional
7372262 no lo van a lograr porque estamos hablando de un asunto que no es exclusivo de las c maras sino de todo el pueblo
7372263 vamos a ejercer el derecho constitucional a la manifestaci n porque la libertad no se implora la libertad se conquista
7372264 vamos a hacer valer los derechos del pueblo y vamos a defender el patrimonio de la naci n
7372265 se debe buscar la participaci n de la iniciativa privada mexicana en aquellas reas en donde no este prohibido por la constituci n
7372266 no sabemos vamos a esperar no s si voy a aguantarles si voy a resistir pol ticamente a nuestros adversarios que nos quieren destruir pol ticamente
7372267 si no me han destruido pol ticamente pues hay esa posibilidad pero si estoy desgastado pol ticamente puede haber otro porque no soy un ambicioso ni lucho por cargos p blicos yo voy a seguir luchando por mis principios y mis ideales
7372268 wanneer een probleem je pad kruist verander dan je richting maar niet je bestemming

7372289 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place
7372290 foreign policy community that the illegal and gratuitous us invasions of afghanistan and iraq and israels 2006 bombing of lebanon civilians with us blessing would result in the overthrow of americas pakistani puppet
7372291 if you hate america so much why dont you move to cuba
7372292 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
7372293 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
7372294 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett
7372295 the war is gonna start any day now so we would have left school anyhow
7372296 fiddle dee dee war war war this war talks spoiling all the fun at every party this spring i get so bored i could scream
7372297 it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time
7372298 i read the opening scene right then and there with vivien leigh and i got the job
7372299 more money than i thought there was in the world
7372300 did not look exactly alike but they were both gorgeous as young men they were extremely attractive
7372301 learn marketing succes and share ideas with others learn to build a list use free advertising build a down line and share your ideas
7372302 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7372303 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7372304 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7372305 anything is possible you can be told that you have a 90 percent chance or a 50 percent chance or a 1 percent chance but you have to believe and you have to fight
7372306 ive met lots of brewers doing the same as the skills are so directly transferable
7372307 te amo hermana m a mi amiga parte de mi vida

7372309 this is not australia and new zealand this is the forums stand that we continue to urge him to meet the commitment that he has pledged mr sikua told radio new zealand
7372310 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7372311 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7372312 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7372313 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7372314 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7372315 it is always worth the investment i dont mind even if they lose because after all it is a game and youre just playing around with money
7372316 the person who hires me has to keep on buying all the counters i require normally he also hovers around to keep a watch on how i am faring
7372317 they kept telling me push push push that was fun a lot of fun
7372318 oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7372319 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites
7372320 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7372321 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites
7372322 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7372323 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7372324 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7372325 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7372326 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7372327 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7372328 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7372329 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7372330 said you had to break iraq up into three different countries
7372331 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
7372332 said you had to break iraq up into three different countries
7372333 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
7372334 t he central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues
7372335 is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7372336 we are not trying to impose our plan if the iraqis dont want it they wont and shouldnt take it
7372337 the united states should actively support a political settlement among iraqs major factions based upon the provisions of the constitution of iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions
7372338 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7372339 andrei will certainly be very motivated and he will have the desire to demonstrate that he is not that which we have seen in london and that he is a true footballer
7372340 he was in line with the play so there was no excuse for it he now knows he was in the wrong
7372341 i have to be very guarded about what i say because the adrenalin is flowing and i am still very angry
7372342 if an official makes a mistake he wont be hung from the grandstand
7372343 there will be no instant reaction of hes gone if officials keep making errors or fail to carry out instructions we speak to them about it as you would expect and take action if required
7372344 but it takes a long time and a great deal of effort to train referees and with the best will in the world they cannot get every decision right
7372345 with the advent of tv shots from multiple angles there are people in football managers players and viewers alike who expect a degree of excellence which cannot be achieved because it is basically perfection
7372346 it is an irony that we have spent a lot of time explaining the intricacies of the offside rule to players and managers because there are still those in the game who say well somebody was offside so the goal shouldnt stand
7372347 now that is coming back to us in as much as people look more closely at how a decision is reached than they might have done previously
7372348 the technicalities of the law at the present moment make it awkward for the linesman
7372349 it used to be that kris boyd would have been offside now when he is walking back towards the play he is not we have had the rule for at least a couple of seasons so the linesman should be able to handle that situation
7372350 heres my penfold hearts you must have played the wrong ball somewhere on the 18th fairway we are playing strict rules so im afraid you lose the hole and the match
7372351 you have no standing there is no one in front of you now you are not going through
7372352 take all their bags back on the cart to the clubhouse
7372353 you will never set foot on pine valley in your lives again and your friend is now barred from pine valley for a year now i would like to play through
7372354 how do you think youll manage to get on with stalin
7372355 easy old boy ill invite him out regularly for a round of golf
7372356 he had been a caddie once to earn some money in his spare time
7372357 i on the other hand knew absolutely nothing about this expensive sport
7372358 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7372359 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7372360 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7372361 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7372362 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7372363 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7372364 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7372365 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7372366 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7372367 hay muchos burros que manejan lindos gmc o ford o toyosas o 4x4 que no saben diferenciar el rojo del amarillo ni el verde con el rojo
7372368 no s por qu pero las composiciones de este disco compacto ostentan el vigor de lo negro para perpetua memoria de los admiradores y fans que cambiar n de piel cuando la escuchen en sus reproductores
7372369 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7372370 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7372371 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7372372 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7372373 number one in the world when it comes to uniformity
7372374 forget it were just not going to even san diego mls project
7372375 it will be like a statement to the world that both the inside and outside qualities are important
7372376 now that everybody knows about it they should both appear on
7372377 the british public would find it strange if there was no british team
7372378 ill be 70 then so i dont need any commitment to anything like that he said
7372379 i would not in any way shape or form try to commit myself to anything like that four years away
7372380 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7372381 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7372382 hemos conseguido lo que quer amos y lo estoy disfrutando much simo ganar con la camiseta del pa s es increible no se compara con nada cuando tengo la suerte de ganar con boca hay una parte que esta feliz y otra no pero ahora todos lo disfrutan

7372385 es diferente a todo porque estamos acostumbrados a estar solos sin que nos moleste nadie estuvimos con un mont n de gente que nunca hemos visto y por lo menos a mi me va a servir de mucho
7372386 you cant tell but everyone is already drunk in this picture it was 10 30am
7372387 man is least himself when he talks in his own person give him a mask and he will tell you the truth
7372388 y se fue pero cuando quiso como si fuera due a de la casa o algo as
7372389 te comprendo todos aqu te comprendemos t eres en verdad maravilloso mira que trabajar con tanta entrega y cuidar a dilcia consolarla quererla no es cualquiera eres especial
7372390 isso verdade para as chamadas faltas continuadas o mais flagrante exemplo o agarr o no caso de ontem a falta foi fora sendo a in rcia decorrente da mesma que atirou os dois jogadores para dentro da rea

7372546 we hebben het koekjeseetpatroon van onze proefpersonen nauwkeurig in kaart gebracht de belangrijkste uitkomst van het onderzoek is dat koekjes erg lekker zijn
7372547 of je nu van gevulde koeken spritsen of eenvoudige biscuitjes houdt in nederland komt iedere koekjeseter aan zijn trekken
7372548 in het verleden kwamen de koekenbakkers er meestal bekaaid vanaf de meeste onderzoeken richtten zich op de gezondheidseffecten van het eten van koekjes het zou overgewicht in de hand werken nu is er eindelijk eens onderzoek gedaan door een betrouwbare onafhankelijke instantie die de positieve effecten van het eten van koekjes benadrukt wij wisten het al maar nu is het onomstotelijke bewezen koekjes zijn lekker
7372549 wat wij verder hebben ontdekt is dat het eten van koekjes gezelligheid bevordert indien de koekjes genuttigd worden in het bijzijn van andere liefhebbers zoals rokers elkaar opzoeken voor het opsteken van een sigaret zo vinden zoetekouwen elkaar rondom de koekjestrommel
7372550 wij hopen dat de publicatie van dit onderzoek er toe bijdraagt dat de nederlandse koekjestrommel open blijft zodat de aanwezige gasten zichzelf naar believen kunnen helpen

7372560 telstra is a real live example of the need for a proper collective bargaining regime to be in place telstra has been prepared to flout the decision of the australian people last year thats why we need the legislation in place as quickly as possible so we at least ensure telstra is required to bargain in good faith they havent done that

7372593 the governments of the world must be pressured to demand that the u n adopt a clear resolution or law that categorically prohibits affronts to prophets to the prophets of the lord and his messengers to his holy books and to the religious holy places
7372594 objectively speaking the cartoon controversy was a tempest in a teacup but subjectively it was a show of strength and in the context of the clash of civilizations a dress rehearsal for the real thing the muslims demonstrated how quickly and effectively they can mobilize the masses and the free west showed that it has nothing to counter the offensive nothing but fear cowardice and an overriding concern about the balance of trade now the islamists know that they are dealing with a paper tiger whose roar is nothing but a tape recording
7372595 the media must transform diversity which is a fact of life into pluralism which is a set of values getting diversity accepted is the role of the education system and acceptance is the role of the law promoting and defending diversity is the task of the media societies must recognize accept and promote diversity

7372598 n o podemos ficar atr s esperando o botafogo esse um cl ssico e n s n o podemos somente nos preocupar com o ataque deles eles que tem que se preocupar com a gente
7372599 n o d pra comparar aquele jogo tinha um car ter mais decisivo e esse aqui n o tanto mas foi um grande jogo assim como aquele a pena o campo n o deixar os times praticarem um futebol melhor a gente sabia que aqui sempre corrido pegado batalhado mas com o campo assim fica pior pra todo mundo
7372600 eu pedi muito que eles chutassem ao gol e eles nem sempre me obedeceram o goleiro deles era novo e mostrou inexperi ncia em alguns lances mas sei que com alguma maturidade a mais ele vai poder seguir a carreira dele tranquilamente
7372601 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7372602 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7372603 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7372604 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble
7372605 isto acontece poucas vezes para mim a primeira nunca vivi isso como jogador nem como treinador mas o futebol sempre traz surpresas acreditava que h equipes como o valencia que t m problemas de jogar com um ou dois jogadores a mais tivemos a sorte de que n o souberam jogar com essa vantagem
7372606 uma equipe tem que ter uma mentalidade no ano passado demonstrou isso e com todas as dificuldades que podemos ter hoje em dia voltamos a vencer
7372607 a rea o da equipe foi positiva os jogadores acreditaram na partida e no segundo tempo vimos um jogo lindo emocionante e justo pela entrega de todos os jogadores que estiveram no campo

7372615 there will be massive problems of supply through to christmas as a result

7372617 people are paying the highest possible prices in retail stores but the quality probably is the worst

7372631 this idea is to use the smallest possible amount of toxin to knock numbers down and then use the vaccine to ensure that the tb cycle is well and truly broken
7372632 the argument is they will work far better together than they would alone
7372633 there is a vaccine available bcg which is the same as the one long used in humans we know it protects cattle against experimental challenge from tb what we dont know is whether it will protect cows from the natural challenge of tb infected possums so this trial is the first ever real world field trial of that
7372634 well use released pigs as judas animals or sentinels as a way of measuring the level at which tb continues to cycle or persist in wildlife
7372635 pigs are very good at this because they rarely pass on tb but they move around over large areas and quickly pick up tb by scavenging any tb infected possum carcasses that inevitably occur if possums are still becoming infected

7372648 a large percentage of farming families in the cowra and area are receiving some sort of subisidy
7372649 at the moment we are sitting on the knife edge with some good winter rainfall but a long way to go before harvest
7372650 this decision has been a boost for morale as many were really starting to look at their third or fourth year without a return
7372651 as we still d not know what will be the result of the harvest this will do so much to the morale of the farmers and give them hope
7372652 and that moral boost will spread throughout the town it also comes at a critical time for many families looking to the financial strain of christmas

7372682 there are artists whose work i dread to see yet again dance dramas that in my view have set back the american psyche several hundred years composers whose names drive me from the concert hall authors whose books i shall never willingly reopen but it has never seemed to me much of an ambition to go though life snarling and spewing
7372683 we normally dont travel outside of the wilmington area for location shots because it adds to production time
7372684 but jacksonville was the store that books a million thought we should use for this particular episode and it turned out to be a good decision

7372714 this is the aldrich bill in disguise the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill the banks have been granted the special privilege of distributing the money and they charge as much as they wish this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed the system is private there should be no legal tender other than that issued by the government the people are the government therefore the government should as the constitution provides regulate the value of money
7372715 the united states constitution grants to congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency the constitution does not give congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank furthermore the constitution certainly does not empower the federal government to erode the american standard of living via an inflationary monetary policy

7372819 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase

7372844 after all so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
7372845 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not
7372846 but no similar mechanism to explore all the wrong doings that went on in the barracks and police stations
7372847 most of the loyalist prisoners just think its time to get on with their lives now that the conflict is over unlike republicans who want to prove a point about the state and its role in the troubles the loyalists are just happy to be free and living their lives again

7372863 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

7372865 my style tip has to do with crazy eyebrows i dont know about you but my eyebrows grow in all sorts of directions and trimming doesnt work i just dont have enough eyebrow to spare for trimming so what do i do i buy myself a little bottle of hair glue the kind that guys use to spike their hair with and an angled brush make sure the hair glue you use is one that dries matte you dont want a shiny eyebrow use your eyebrow brush first to get the shape you need and put a tiny bit of the hair glue on your angled brush and apply in the direction your eyebrows grow just a tiny bit keeps your crazy brows in place all day long

7372896 mike has developed a strong senior team and there was no question about succession
7372897 the board looks forward to working closely with dominic during the next phase of the companys development
7372898 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months mr tilley said in a statement
7372899 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised ebit in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7372900 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come mr stevens said
7372901 the strategies we have put in place have put us in a very good position in terms of liquidity and capital providing some insulation from the difficulties of the current environment
7372902 together with an intense focus on risk management we are very well placed to manage our way through the cycle and take advantage of opportunities created by the current environment he added
7372903 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit eps growth in the long term
7372904 dominic and i have worked very closely together over the past four years and i have every confidence that he will be an outstanding chief executive mr tilley said
7372905 underlying eps earnings per share grew strongly by 12 5 per cent and we are confident this performance provides a clear path for delivering improved results in full year 2009 and beyond chief executive jo farnik said
7372906 following the completion of our strategic review and the identification of opportunities for growth and improved efficiency we undertook deliberate investment in restructuring and this has and will continue to deliver strong financial returns mr farnik said
7372907 austereo is uniquely placed through its current leading ratings and sales share to capitalise on future advertising market uplift chief executive michael anderson said

7372911 its occurred to us that we arent the worlds only leftist mormons we arent the only socially progressive mormons
7372912 member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
7372913 someone who participates in or was raised in the culture produced by adherents to any group that derives its authority from the restoration carried out by joseph smith jr
7372914 in my opinion if a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is formally excommunicated then he she is no longer a mormon
7372915 but if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people nevertheless ye shall not cast him out of your places of worship for unto such shall ye continue to minister for ye know not but what they will return and repent and come unto me with full purpose of heart and i shall heal them
7372916 and i do think we need to remember that hardly anybody outside the greater mormon community really cares about this question
7372917 i really love the mormon church and i want to regain my covenant blessings
7372918 in my opinion if a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is formally excommunicated then he she is no longer a mormon

7372922 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
7372923 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
7372924 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period
7372925 the u s lodging industry experienced another soft week as occupancy declined 4 5 percent

7372927 version 4 represents the first major overhaul of the accubar architecture in four years and will provide the structure for major enhancements in an operators ability to analyze data and maintain corporate oversight
7372928 a long time ago i drove a pinto always wanting a jaguar a few years ago i started with accubar and i was amazed and impressed with how much time i saved and how much more accurate my bar cost analysis became then version 4 came out
7372929 the downside to this is the massive effort it takes to manage that list version 4 0 aims to help you get the situation under control with much less time investment
7372930 for instance you can now print your wine list based only on what you have in stock as often as you like
7372931 thats one new feature thats creating a lot of buzz
7372932 many of the reports can now be viewed online which has the benefit of being able to click on a number and drill into the data behind it
7372933 this will make the system much more capable of pointing you more directly to a problem and possible causes
7372934 before if something was not quite right you would have to go back to accubar fix the problem regenerate the report and go through the whole procedure again with version 4 reports can be web based so you can look at them right away and drill down to the problem and make corrections a very nice feature
7372935 in my particular county and state the department of revenue wants how much alcohol we received into inventory in gallons or liters in the past even with accubar i had to calculate gallons purchased this was fairly complicated with 750 ml bottles one liter bottles 12 ounce bottles etc the folks at accubar actually listened to my needs and have included the option of gallons purchased in their receiving report this shows me that the company has the interest of the customer in mind to make their product better
7372936 we always attempt to implement new capabilities with the same attention to keeping it easy to use and intuitive
7372937 we have already started work on the next set of enhancements which will include more wine management features draft beer management tools more analysis and trending reporting and more corporate multi unit functionality to help the corporate operators
7372938 highest in guest satisfaction among mid scale hotel chains with limited service
7372939 pegasus is the only crs provider that maintained 99 997 percent availability in 2007 a real breakthrough relative to the rest of the industry and a number we aim to better in 2008
7372940 if a growing hotel chain like drury ignores the risk of crs downtime whether it be as little as 003 percent over a year or as much as what others are offering in the industry then they risk losing valuable reservations
7372941 the harp group recognizes the upside potential of this market
7372942 the lax hotel market has performed extremely well in recent years with occupancies for the major hotels topping 80 and revpar increases at almost 8 year to date these strong underlying fundamentals coupled by the high cost of new construction and lack of available sites around lax one of the worlds busiest airports made this a strategic offering to a collection of domestic and international investors that pursued the transaction this sale following the trade of hyatt century city in the second quarter further demonstrates strong investor appetite for high quality hotel properties in the greater los angeles area despite a more challenging debt environment and concerns about the overall economy
7372943 compiling a great wine collection is an essential ingredient of sophisticated dining these days and were delighted to learn that wine spectator has once again chosen to distinguish the wine list at turtle bay estate house with its highest recognition
7372944 it is a one day education and networking event for the hospitality industry by the hospitality industry allowing attendees to come together to learn about the latest trends in the industry and access collective knowledge and experience from their peers
7372945 at cheyenne mountain resort we have been steadily reducing our carbon footprint by adopting such practices as buying local and organic produce switching to energy efficient lighting using environmentally friendly paints and implementing cost effective towel and linen reuse options for multiple night guests
7372946 now we are cementing our commitment to the environment by becoming a partner member of the green hotels association and further expanding the measures we are taking
7372947 sustainable cards in hotels are really the tip of the iceberg
7372948 have higher transportation costs and a slowing u s economy shifted lodging demand within lodging sectors trends and implications for future hotel sales strategies marketing strategies and discounting strategies
7372949 if the church made priesthood ordination available to all worthy women would you accept ordination
7372950 suppose the church made priesthood ordination available to women who feel that it would help them serve more effectively in the same way that young women are now free to choose to serve a mission if given this opportunity would you choose priesthood ordination
7372951 unless im about to move ill accept almost any good thing offered me even if i dont want it
7372952 i dont feel that heavenly father needs me to hold the priesthood
7372953 so it seems important to understand how in the absense of considerations related to loyalty mormon women in fact think about this issue
7372954 parental teaching qualifies children for life and prepares worthy young men for the joy of missionary service
7372955 mormon women can still receive all the blessings of the priesthood even though they arent ordained to it
7372956 if you get a piece there wont be any left for me
7372957 the spirit has not confirmed to me that this is what i should be doing now
7372958 though we adore men individually we agree that as a group theyre rah ther stu pid
7372959 first as a thought experiment does it seem genuinely plausible that upon being offered the priesthood most mormon women would choose not to be ordained
7372960 gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose
7372961 t here is no evidence that allowing same sex couples to marry weakens the institution
7372962 as society continues to move in a direction of more acceptance what do you think the future holds for gays and lesbians in the church
7372963 i cannot believe that a biological condition would ultimately impede someones salvation
7372964 the church will never however move to a position of even indifference toward homosexuality
7372965 the biblical passages used to condemn homosexual behavior are not difficult to set aside
7372966 bible passages are hardly the biggest hurdles to be overcome in the lds church on this issue as well as many others
7372967 foisted a world view on her that caused a lot of damage
7372968 are kids ever really forced to go to church in any sense other than that they are the kids and their parents are the parents and families are very rarely democracies should parents really simply give way to such premature conclusions about ultimate questions drawn by pre and early teens
7372969 by making sure she didnt get in with the wrong crowd and by emphasizing adherence to the word of wisdom and sexual abstinence sure these things arent for everyone but it seems incumbent upon parents to guide kids and teenagers in this direction
7372970 any teenager who rejects the church will fall into bad habits
7372971 a father who expresses to his children who have rejected his belief system that he wishes they would believe and that would make him happy the very definition of oppression
7372972 i want to share my knowledge that the church is not true
7372973 i want to share my knowledge that the church is true
7372974 people in the church arent interested in talking to people like you
7372975 its important to maintain a dialogue especially when people share negative experiences about the church
7372976 we love you and so we accept any choice you want to make
7372977 im sorry to hear that can i help you with anythig
7372978 cant we just be happy for people whatever path they find themselves on
7372979 cant we just be happy for people whatever path they find themselves on
7372980 johnny you have to play baseball because it will make me happy what you dont like it and it makes you unhappy but what about me
7372981 my butt is in the pew most sundays for similar reasons
7372982 you can always ask for whatever you want as long as you will gracefully accept no for an answer
7372983 and please bless me that i will have success in my career as a righteous way to provide for my family and serve my brothers and sisters help me to remember that this is a way that i can serve you and through which i can learn and grow closer to you so that i can keep it balanced against the other parts of my life in the manner you would have me do it
7372984 i pray because im helpless i pray because the need flows out of me all the time waking and sleeping it doesnt change god it changes me
7372985 i ate breakfast because the agent blake ostler decided to do so
7372986 because reasons x y z persuaded me to do so
7372987 first x y and z all entail beliefs that you hold about the nature of the world
7372988 if i do a because it is probable that in the absence of b i would not have done a
7372989 beliefs are typically held as the best available approximation of the state of reality not the result of uncaused choice
7372990 well why does that agent have that psychological make up
7372991 when i came out i saw a gentleman lying on the sidewalk on his back and the paramedics were already working on him
7372992 about the only thing i saw was them loading up a pickup on the back of a wrecker and hauling it away
7372993 the daily traffic since its been punched through to purcell has probably gone up three hundred percent
7372994 i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
7372995 if gospel doctrine sunday school classes as currently structured dont really consistently meet any of the three purposes discussed above why do we have them
7372996 this is the greatest calling i dont have to do anything but i get to attend other wards in the stake and check out the girls
7372997 an opportunity is given to follow sympathetically lessons that are taught the sermons that are preached and the testimonies that are borne judging not by eloquence but by sincerity here is a chance to drink deeply from fountain heads for the humblest teacher or speaker will contribute thought which can be developed
7372998 die demonstranten haben in sprechch ren die unabh ngigkeit tibets gefordert das seit jahrhunderten ein teil chinas ist
7372999 es ist v llig klar das dadurch chinesische gesetze verletzt wurden
7373000 i cant make a final judgment on how many positives there will be but if you extrapolated from sydney to beijing you would think we would have something in the high 30s instead of six
7373001 we believe we have had less cases because its become much more difficult to cheat
7373002 we have increased the penalties so that any athlete who is penalised for more than six months at these games wont be able to go to the next olympic games
7373003 the sports federations have been very active and there were 39 positives in the month before the opening of the olympic village
7373004 i am sure each country will highlight what suits it best one will say the gold medal tally counts and the other will say the total medals count we take no position on that
7373005 china has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i think this will have positive effects in the future
7373006 intelligently embedded in universities so there will be no white elephants
7373007 there is also heightened awareness of the chinese for the environment
7373008 the factories that have been closed to reduce pollution will not be opened again the polluting industries wont be allowed back
7373009 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and subsequent games hosts
7373010 i think london can put the bar higher but there will be things that london wont be able to copy or equal the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers is something that wont be easy to do
7373011 the grant of this patent acknowledges the true innovation behind the lauriad muco adhesive technology
7373012 it reinforces our positioning in the target markets for the lauriad technology oropharyngeal candidiasis labial herpes and chronic pain
7373013 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7373014 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7373015 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7373016 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7373017 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7373018 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7373019 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7373020 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7373021 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7373022 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7373023 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
7373024 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7373025 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7373026 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7373027 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7373028 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7373029 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7373030 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7373031 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7373079 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7373080 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7373081 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7373082 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7373083 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7373084 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7373085 nothing we can do about it now but move on
7373086 i had the lead twice and i gave it back both times leaving two balls over the plate a game like today the importance of the game you cant allow that to happen

7373098 like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
7373099 wow look at what happened to the trader trash and office whores
7373100 what im most proud of in my entire career is the violence against women act
7373101 it showed we can change peoples lives but the change is always one person at a time there are many more laws and attitudes that need changing so women are treated with equal opportunities at work in the classroom and in our health care system
7373102 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
7373103 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
7373104 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7373105 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7373106 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7373107 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7373108 senator its time to yeah i dont know what to make of this either
7373109 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7373110 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7373111 ive been to just about every major sporting event of the last 20 years and this was as exciting a moment as ive ever seen
7373112 there is demand for google search despite what the carriers put in front of them

7373116 god in his deepest mystery is not a solitude but a family since he has in himself fatherhood sonship and the essence of the family which is love
7373117 we believe that it is essential for the indian government to take essential steps to actually set their approval for vodafone soon
7373118 and it should not take too long for the sale to be concluded
7373119 the plan hasnt been implemented yet but we have been working towards this goal
7373120 the timing of the announcement of the new unit depends on our top management
7373121 science has nothing of value to say on the great and aching questions of life death love and meaning
7373122 i live in an old building and im worried that theres lead in the paint
7373123 the lead content is vanishingly small certainly lower than any threshold of toxicity
7373124 that cant be you havent found out anything about the lead paint in my house
7373125 manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing
7373126 there is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed and encouraged in the game
7373127 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7373128 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7373129 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7373130 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble
7373131 these doubts have been cleared up by undertakings which guarantee dsl broadband operators equal treatment with the new company regarding access to audiovisual content held by the vivendi group of which sfr is a part
7373132 our performance continues to be underpinned by strong support from investors both domestically and offshore from intermediaries and share brokers institutional investors and borrowing clients
7373133 this ongoing support ensures we continue to strengthen our service offering we see excellent opportunities in these areas over the next 12 months
7373134 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7373135 radio retaliation is about an exodus of conscious people who are willing to acknowledge something is wrong with the official version in news and culture
7373136 thought it would be funny to see what would happen when they put a young asian lad in with someone who wanted to kill asians
7373137 were going to burn you alive and we will stab you we know who you are and were not going to let you go
7373138 although no one should be subjected to racist bullying perhaps the hookhanded one might have thought about that before he started spewing out his own poisonous brand of race hate
7373139 im trying to get the community involved as this is a great opportunity for locals to help create a fun and entertaining project
7373140 ive received a grant from the northwest film forum but were still in need of funds to pay actors and crew
7373141 i moved up here for a variety of reasons one of which is that i was inspired by the wto riots
7373142 i love activism and am also a huge fan of the artistic and independent spirit of the region which i love
7373143 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7373144 theres a war going on out there and in here
7373145 while we have ships on the sea we shall always have a homeland
7373146 nutritionists have traditionally recognized breakfast as the most important meal of the day
7373147 its a virtue for obama that he seems to be above the fray so long as he shows the toughness and hands on leadership to steer his party and the country out of what has been a dark partisan period into something better and brighter
7373148 barack obama the ultra charismatic senator who landed on the national stage as if from outer space seemingly untouched by the usual racial and political scars promising a new era of bipartisanship and national healing
7373149 you will also enjoy entertainment for the evening by r amp b band soul featuring vocalist ashley cole we will have on the ground reports live from delegates and other special guests during the evening

7373151 i disagree with your premise that photography is not a hobby but is an art form i believe it is both

7373153 it is the right place to be now sport has been the catalyst
7373154 the us government encourages the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
7373155 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7373156 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7373157 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7373158 free for the first 10 000 copies get it now

7373169 it was a major eye opener and i dont think anyone seriously believes the figures not even the bank of england
7373170 it was likely that the official expenditure data were overstating the current strength of consumer spending
7373171 estimates of the increase in the volume and value of retail sales in may and the subsequent decrease in june reflect the actual changes in the turnover reported by businesses to onss large and comprehensive retail sales inquiry
7373172 it is not one figure it is the economic picture that the data have been painting since the turn of this year
7373173 while all the anecdotal evidence has signalled a consumer downturn the ons is suggesting there is a boom marrying the two together is not easy

7373181 because it was so wet today we had to beef up our ruck ball area
7373182 normally we go in there with only two or three but today we concentrated on putting extra bodies in there and it paid off for us in terms of controlling possession
7373183 i think we controlled it all the way i think the only opportunities marlborough had were the ones we gifted them through errors so yeah i think we pretty much had control of the pace and the pressure of the game
7373184 we concentrated on taking the emotion of the occasion out of it
7373185 we based our whole game plan on the skill level rather than the emotion which marlborough brought over the hill with them we just played clever rugby
7373186 for these guys in particular they carry kahu in high regard and they were absolutely out there to make sure that he lifted the shield at the end of the day
7373187 we can do it softcore if you want but you should know that i go both ways

7373190 mike tilley came to challenger with a clear mandate he has fulfilled that mandate and the board has been considering the right structure for the next phase of the companys development challenger financial chairman peter polson said
7373191 mike has developed a strong senior team and there was no question about succession
7373192 the board looks forward to working closely with dominic during the next phase of the companys development
7373193 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months mr tilley said in a statement
7373194 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised ebit in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7373195 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come mr stevens said
7373196 the strategies we have put in place have put us in a very good position in terms of liquidity and capital providing some insulation from the difficulties of the current environment
7373197 together with an intense focus on risk management we are very well placed to manage our way through the cycle and take advantage of opportunities created by the current environment he added
7373198 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit eps growth in the long term
7373199 dominic and i have worked very closely together over the past four years and i have every confidence that he will be an outstanding chief executive mr tilley said
7373200 i think this time last year we took the game a little light and there was no chance of that happening this week
7373201 we went down last week against southland and played pretty poorly really at home so it was all about the hunger this week and bringing our game which was all about using the ball and attacking so i think we showed that tonight
7373202 the pleasing thing about the whole game was that we never let a try in so we managed to mix both attack and defence well tonight
7373203 although its only early in the season we really had to get back on track tonight and we came down here with a mission to win but to win with a bonus point was very well done and that keeps us on track to hopefully move up the table
7373204 going into the game our preparation was really good and i expected better than that we played nowhere near our potential and what was so disappointing was that we couldnt get a thing right we couldnt get a trick right at all and we got what we deserved at the end of the day
7373205 the frustrating thing was that early on we created some good opportunities but we just couldnt get our support to the people who were making the line breaks we got beaten up at the contact and kept giving up turnover ball and we played catch up all day the frustrating thing was we were positive with our attack we just couldnt finish it off
7373206 i thought hawkes bay looked quite vulnerable early on but we just couldnt keep the tempo on them or keep the ball and we just played into their hands but id have to say that through their hunger they took their opportunities and every single opportunity that went their way they took and that just shows you that they were up for the game
7373207 things didnt go well at the start and i think we may have gone away from our structures a bit we talked about it at halftime we werent tackling their big runners and werent putting them down early and they were able to offload so that hurt us as well
7373208 we were always confident that we could come back even at halftime at 27 6 we knew that if they were able to do it we had the players and the structures to be able to as well but they got on top of us early and we couldnt bounce back from it to their credit they defended very well
7373209 we did make some linebreaks and that was one of the frustrating things wed talked about throwing those 70 30 passes but every time we got through wed throw it away
7373210 our performance continues to be underpinned by strong support from investors both domestically and offshore from intermediaries and share brokers institutional investors and borrowing clients
7373211 this ongoing support ensures we continue to strengthen our service offering we see excellent opportunities in these areas over the next 12 months
7373212 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7373213 medical surgical nurses practice in a variety of settings and care for a broad range of patients
7373214 this is a perfect time to thank medical surgical nurses for all that they do
7373215 automatic mental associations predict future choices of undecided decision makers
7373216 this kind of testing has many applications but certainly political polling at election time would be one it cant give answers to all questions but it could certainly help pollsters to get more information than people now share
7373217 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7373218 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7373219 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7373220 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble
7373221 for example seafood is one of the few wild foods still consumed by large numbers of people though we know that the mercury found in marine fish and shellfish poses a threat to humans not to mention the ecosystem itself we know very little about the physical and geochemical processes that link mercury in the atmosphere to the toxic form found in seafood
7373222 fate and bioavailability of mercury in aquatic ecosystem and effects on human exposure
7373223 science should inform regulatory and public health decisions about issues such as the accumulation of mercury in our environment
7373224 the superfund basic research program provides support for workshops such as these that interpret findings in terms useful to decision makers that incorporate their perspectives into the research agenda
7373225 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
7373226 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
7373227 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
7373228 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
7373229 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
7373230 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
7373231 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
7373232 the effects of time frames on personal savings estimates savings behavior and financial decision making
7373233 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
7373234 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
7373235 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
7373236 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
7373237 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
7373238 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
7373239 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
7373240 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
7373241 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
7373242 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
7373243 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
7373244 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
7373245 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
7373246 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
7373247 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger
7373248 congressional and presidential candidates now acknowledge that something has to be done to play a leading role on energy and climate change to not fall behind the rest of the world
7373249 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
7373250 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
7373251 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
7373252 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health
7373253 they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
7373254 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time
7373255 i was surprised to find that two large groups of non viewers were exceedingly different in many ways but shared commonalities regarding television
7373256 very strong opinions not only about television but also about those issues they saw as being associated with it such as politics and couple interaction
7373257 by researching families without television i think we learn a lot about the role of television in the lives of american families
7373258 i know this may sound counter intuitive but when we look closely at family interaction in the absence of tv we see the ways in which television has become an integral part of our lives
7373259 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
7373260 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
7373261 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
7373262 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
7373263 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbors gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations
7373264 potential causes of higher mortality in elderly users of conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications
7373265 you cant imagine what i saw bodies strewn around i was in my flat when i heard a deafening sound the building shook from its foundation
7373266 we condemn all acts of terrorism and i think that such wanton targeting of civilians should be condemned in the strongest possible terms
7373267 i wish simply from the bottom of my heart to say to you vive paris
7373268 we are here in paris paris which stood erect and rose in order to free herself paris oppressed downtrodden and martyred but still paris free now freed by the hands of frenchmen the capital of fighting france france the great eternal
7373269 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7373270 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7373271 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals

7373274 mike tilley came to challenger with a clear mandate he has fulfilled that mandate and the board has been considering the right structure for the next phase of the companys development challenger financial chairman peter polson said
7373275 mike has developed a strong senior team and there was no question about succession
7373276 the board looks forward to working closely with dominic during the next phase of the companys development
7373277 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months mr tilley said in a statement
7373278 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised ebit in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7373279 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come mr stevens said
7373280 the strategies we have put in place have put us in a very good position in terms of liquidity and capital providing some insulation from the difficulties of the current environment
7373281 together with an intense focus on risk management we are very well placed to manage our way through the cycle and take advantage of opportunities created by the current environment he added
7373282 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit eps growth in the long term
7373283 dominic and i have worked very closely together over the past four years and i have every confidence that he will be an outstanding chief executive mr tilley said
7373284 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7373285 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7373286 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7373287 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of financial institutions
7373288 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7373289 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets
7373290 austereo is uniquely placed through its current leading ratings and sales share to capitalise on future advertising market uplift chief executive michael anderson said
7373291 in tighter economic conditions radio outperformed total metropolitan media in part due to its flexibility cost efficiency and targeted audience reach he said
7373292 for the july to december 2008 half we believe that capital city radio growth will be in positive territory in a range below three per cent he said
7373293 in the past year combined radio and online advertising campaigns have almost doubled he said
7373294 weve been working flat out on the cannon ever since wednesday and i think weve ironed out all the faults
7373295 underlying eps earnings per share grew strongly by 12 5 per cent and we are confident this performance provides a clear path for delivering improved results in full year 2009 and beyond chief executive jo farnik said
7373296 following the completion of our strategic review and the identification of opportunities for growth and improved efficiency we undertook deliberate investment in restructuring and this has and will continue to deliver strong financial returns mr farnik said

7373377 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7373378 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7373379 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7373380 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7373381 pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals
7373382 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7373383 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law
7373384 the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7373390 even as i write today there is a situation among the new believers fellowship that needs your prayers recently the son of a very influential man became a christian and this provoked the man to order retaliation on the believers in his area this past week their houses were burned in the night but they escaped into the bush where about twenty men and women and a number of children spent several days and nights in the open unprotected from the rain and cold among them six men were caught and detained for questioning the leader of their network went to help them and he too was detained and beaten since then another leader has been working for their release he told me today that the network leader could have been released several days ago but refused to be separated from the others the young christians were offered their freedom if they would recant their faith by reciting the creed of their former religion but they all forcefully declined everyone involved has seen the strength of their commitment thank god for their witness and pray for the resolution of this situation

7373411 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
7373412 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
7373413 to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons
7373414 initially saddam chose to conceal his nuclear program in its entirety as he did with iraqs bw biological warfare program aggressive un inspections after desert storm forced saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program in the wake of desert storm iraq took steps to conceal key elements of its program and preserve what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community
7373415 many locations associated with previous wmd programs and sites under monitoring by the united nations have been completely looted often there is nothing but a concrete slab at locations where once stood plants or laboratories
7373416 we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that wmd elements were relocated out of iraq prior to the war
7373417 isg technical experts fully evaluated less than one quarter of one percent of the over 10 000 weapons caches throughout iraq
7373418 saddam wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction when sanctions were lifted
7373419 members of al qaida an organization bearing responsibility for the attacks are known to be in iraq
7373420 attacks underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of wmd by international terrorist organizations
7373421 necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
7373422 pre war administration statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7373423 postwar information supports prewar assessments and statements that abu musab al zarqawi was in baghdad and that was present in northern iraq
7373424 one of the reported contacts between iraq and before the war has been confirmed and two other meetings have since been identified
7373425 a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to draw inferences
7373426 that iraq provided material support to bin laden and al qaeda iraq collaborated in or supported bin laden al qaedas terrorist acts of september 11 iraq provided materiel support to al qaeda and that it did so with knowledge and intent to further al qaedas criminal acts
7373427 iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
7373428 to assassinate former president bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces
7373429 that threaten the lives and safety of united states citizens
7373430 to release repatriate or account for non iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by iraq including an american serviceman
7373431 on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the united nations security council
7373432 to use united states armed forces pursuant to united nations security council resolution 678 1990 in order to achieve implementation of security council resolution 660 661 662 664 665 666 667 669 674 and 677
7373433 this biased report from chairman john rockefellers committee analyzed various statements by bush administration officials and compared them to post war intelligence
7373434 statements by the president vice president secretary of state and the national security advisor regarding possible iraqi nuclear weapons program were generally substantiated by intelligence community estimates but did not convey the substantial disagreements that existed in the intelligence community
7373435 statements regarding iraqs possession of biological agents weapons production capability and use of mobile biological laboratories were substantiated by intelligence information
7373436 statements regarding iraqs possession of chemical weapons were substantiated by intelligence information
7373437 statements regarding iraqs possession of weapons of mass destruction were generally substantiated by intelligence information though many statements made regarding ongoing production prior to late 2002 reflected a higher level of certainty than the intelligence judgments themselves
7373438 statements regarding iraqi ballistic missiles were generally substantiated by available intelligence
7373439 statements that iraq was developing unmanned aerial vehicles that could be use to deliver chemical or biological weapons were generally substantiated by intelligence information but did not convey the substantial disagreements or evolving views that existed in the intelligence community
7373440 statements regarding iraqs support for terrorist groups other than were substantiated by intelligence information
7373441 statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7373442 the president has authority under the constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states as congress recognized in public law 107 40
7373443 to take appropriate action in accordance with the constitution and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with its international obligations

7373458 the liberals control the ultimate passage of so much of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them mr rudd told abc radio today
7373459 are they going to puncture a 3 7 or 6 1 billion immediate black hole into the budget at a time of global economic uncertainty
7373460 my appeal is that you are either going to be part of the responsible economic future of this country or simply play short term politics
7373461 we have by hell at least gaind liberty thats worth our fall thus low tho we are driven better to rule in hell than serve in heaven

7373463 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7373464 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7373465 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7373466 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7373467 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7373468 they skidded between 1 000 and 1 500 meters yards
7373469 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7373470 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good

7373494 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7373495 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7373496 we did a hell of a job putting america back where it belongs on top of the world
7373497 it is more important and more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7373498 we put our time and hearts into this to come through and finally win the gold medal not just for ourselves but for america it means a lot
7373499 it means everything to me its so rewarding to see your hard work pay off
7373500 they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted if it wasnt for our determination we wouldnt have pulled it through
7373501 dwyane made a couple big plays and we all know kobe likes the ball down the stretch
7373502 we played well we almost had it we fought to the end we had a chance
7373503 that probably goes down as one of the greatest games in olympic history
7373504 all three of us took time out and took the moment in being part of the 04 olympic team and not getting to show our talent we really wanted to win this

7373517 we are the wealthiest country in the world but there are still pockets of our population who are not getting the health care they need
7373518 every time i see these kinds of statistics im always amazed to see where the united states is because we are a country that prides itself on having such advanced medical care and developing new technology and new approaches to treating illness but at the same time not everybody has access to those new technologies
7373519 our health care system focuses on providing high tech services for complicated cases we do this very well
7373520 what we do not do is provide basic primary and preventive health care services we do not pay for these services and do not have a delivery system that is designed to provide either primary prevention or adequately treat patients with chronic diseases

7373527 n o vou atribuir o mau jogo qualidade do gramado vou atribui a um futebol ao meu ver que n o andou com a qualidade com que esper vamos

7373529 desde que cheguei quarta e domingo quarta e domingo n o d tempo de fazer jogadas ensaiadas finaliza o eu confio nos jogadores e eles n o tiveram culpa daquilo que receberam esses atletas s o mais v timas do que perdedores voc s puderam perceber a disparidade entre as duas equipes hoje domingo no preparo f sico
7373530 eu nunca peguei coisa boa sempre pego os clubes em situa o dif cil vai custar tempo mas vamos sair disso mais dif cil brigar embaixo porque o sofrimento maior voc n o dorme porque planeja e n o sai do jeito que voc quer se eles ca rem para a segunda divis o v o perder mercado e ningu m quer isso eles n o querem perder

7373546 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7373547 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7373548 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble

7373553 o pessoal se preocupa muito com o final da jogada mas temos que ver de onde sai o cruzamento quando a jogada do primeiro gol da portuguesa saiu j tinha cantado de l do banco que era perigosa mas as pessoas olham quem est na rea e crucifica quem est l para tirar
7373554 fomos bem com tr s zagueiros soubemos segurar bem quando a portuguesa veio para cima da gente no segundo tempo
7373555 ele pediu para n o nos acomodarmos porque 4 a 0 um resultado que pode tranq ilizar
7373556 o importante foi que conquistamos essa vit ria a equipe deu uma diminu da no ritmo no segundo tempo mas teve at a possibilidade de fazer o quinto gol e matar o jogo

7373559 we cant get out of our area as it is now there are times i cant get to work on time because of that traffic
7373560 we see no increased impact on traffic especially with the shared parking agreement we have with the medical facility north of the prayer center
7373561 once completed i feel comfortable with how the traffic will flow in that area
7373562 im impressed with all the work thats been done and the design of the buildings its a much better view of the property than five years ago
7373563 i believe the change in widening the roads will alleviate the traffic problem so i dont see a real cause for concern there
7373564 this is a community building much like the ones recently added to parkview christian church and st francis of assisi in this country we have the freedom of worship any religion of our choice this prayer center is well built and beautiful and the community building ties in well with it
7373565 o time se acomodou com o 1 a 0 pod amos ter mais posse de bola pois o vasco ia sair mais para o jogo precisando do resultado ficamos satisfeitos e pagamos caro por isso
7373566 dominamos a partida poder amos ter continuado pressionando eles deixando eles no campo de defesa e tentar ampliar
7373567 viemos com o objetivo da vit ria o vasco se escondeu o jogo inteiro e achou um golzinho mas futebol assim
7373568 n o d pra comparar aquele jogo tinha um car ter mais decisivo e esse aqui n o tanto mas foi um grande jogo assim como aquele a pena o campo n o deixar os times praticarem um futebol melhor a gente sabia que aqui sempre corrido pegado batalhado mas com o campo assim fica pior pra todo mundo
7373569 eu pedi muito que eles chutassem ao gol e eles nem sempre me obedeceram o goleiro deles era novo e mostrou inexperi ncia em alguns lances mas sei que com alguma maturidade a mais ele vai poder seguir a carreira dele tranquilamente

7373571 a number of chinese house church pastors were forced to sign a written agreement that they would not participate in religious services while the olympic games are taking place
7373572 when the news came that president bush will visit kuanjie protestant church of the tspm it caused widespread concern among the house churches they believe that the chinese rulers have been consistently cheating and ridiculing their guests from overseas by winning popularity through misleading the public and by mixing the false with the genuine through these means they intensify their persecution president bushs visit to the tspm will certainly be utilized by the chinese communists
7373573 the world isnt just sending athletes to the olympics but surveillance technology that will help the government keep tabs on its people for years to come american companies alone have sold china technology that invisibly copies computer hard drives reads encrypted text and performs facial recognition analysis on surveillance video
7373574 at least 20 000 police surveillance cameras are being installed along streets here in southern china and will soon be guided by sophisticated computer software from an american financed company to recognize automatically the faces of police suspects and detect unusual activity

7373591 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever thank you to the people of china through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent these were truly exceptional games
7373592 we would like to send out an appeal for calm where individuals have frictions between them we would ask them to work with the police and with other agencies instead of young people sadly losing their lives a man who was a son a brother and a friend has been lost and clearly that should be enough to make people think this is a crime that should not continue to occur we are aware there are tensions between rival gangs in the community and are alive to that issue and are working with the city council to enable young people to come together to resolve their differences
7373593 i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this

7373603 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7373604 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7373605 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7373606 they are not going to change dramatically you dont have to buy a hybrid everybody has the opportunity to make a difference to their fuel economy by the way they drive
7373607 its like being a golfer you are always going out and trying to do better

7373629 i dont think rio should worry about losing out on the england captaincy
7373630 i dont think it is a reflection of anything other than a persons choice i dont think there was anyone nailed on for the england captains job
7373631 it was always rio or john terry it was a flip of a coin it could have gone either way i am sure it was a close call
7373632 at rios age he shouldnt be worried about the effect of that he just has to carry on he has proved himself a great centre back so there is nothing else he can do
7373633 the advantage for john terry is that he has been captaining chelsea for quite a while you have to give that consideration
7373634 in the long term rio will be our captain there is no question about that we are very very comfortable with it

7373638 i was thinking about whether it would be possible to find someone that no one knows in this world of social networking and facebook

7373662 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7373663 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7373664 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7373665 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7373666 pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals
7373667 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7373668 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law
7373669 the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7373678 it says that when given the chance african americans can excel in even the most competitive of circumstances
7373679 and everybody told me that a black player couldnt do that
7373680 all of these people strangers were calling me nappy ugly dark skin big nose big lips like this is crazy
7373681 i wanted to write back like who drilled it in your head that beauty only comes one way i had to have security around me all the time and i couldnt really respond to it i had to deal with so much hate and the only thing to do was to try and dismiss it
7373682 i was the eldest of five kids and id raised my family since i was 12 years old
7373683 so i figured i could take on that kind of responsibility
7373684 he said arthur your hair is falling out youre too thin and your body is breaking down it looks to me like you are having a nervous breakdown and youre too dumb to even know it i was 23 or maybe 24 years old and the pressures are much greater than you feel at the particular time i felt so much older from being under the microscope all the time my body couldnt take all of that weight
7373685 i have brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents
7373686 one of the cautions ive asked of barack obama and hes adhered to
7373687 is that you cant make this about being african american or making history
7373688 you cant be the archivist of your own time history will record what it records your job is just to do what you can to your highest potential are you going to get a raw deal sometimes yeah but theres no choice except to keep quiet and to swallow it
7373689 i still take it out from time to time and read through those messages
7373690 its uplifting to know that there are people out there who care about me and what im doing that provides a reservoir of strength during the tough moments sometimes you want to be reminded of the community that supports you because there are going to be some lonely days
7373691 if you are a person diagnosed as seropositive hiv positive and live a normal life without taking antiretrovirals you can help me with a book that i am writing a book that will feature the testimonies of those who have survived this diagnosis this book will be in support of and will be of great help to those who suffer the social calvary of seropositivity and aids history will recognize the courage and bravery of each witness and your testimony will support and bring hope to those affected demonstrating that it is possible to escape the incorrect forecasts of the official view on aids
7373692 do any of you believe in freedom of speech do you care to comment on that
7373693 now im going to have to shut this off that isnt necessary
7373694 your not talking to me why dont you believe in freedom of speech
7373695 if you have nothing to hide why do you want privacy
7373696 lets listen to what these anti obama protesters have to say
7373697 this is out of control these ruffian leftists are unavoidably encompassing me and potentially cursing

7373714 ive never seen anything like this ever before in my life especially the drama surrounding phelps 7th gold and his one one hundredth of a victory and dara being 41 but the game of life is sometimes decided like that and it certainly was in the pool
7373715 never before have the modern olympic games aroused more anticipation on the sheer basis of their location not for mexico city and its built in political turmoil not for los angeles in a time when the future of the games was at stake not even for athens the return of the games to greece in the shadow of the war on terror no this was something different something bigger because of chinas dramatically growing importance to world politics and economy and even more because of the symbolism this ambitious society would attach to the games so whether michael phelps could master his daunting challenge regardless of whether yao ming or liu xiang could produce star quality heroics for the home country regardless of how many photographs kobe bryant could pose for in the land where he is king the ultimate story would be china would their games become an ad hoc forum for global protest there were storm warnings during the torch relay but in the end the answer was no these are subjects for playing fields other than the olympics would their opening ceremony out strip all of its predecessors its been nitpicked for a couple of deceptive elements but the answer was a resounding yes the budget was vast and every expenditure was visible would their heat or pollution problems compromise the outdoor competition whether because of extraordinary preventive measures or maybe just extraordinary luck it didnt happen would the host country rise up to win the medal count if the subject is gold then the answer again is yes so its one of the biggest stories in olympic history the international olympic committee the international community and the worlds largest country rolled the dice and against a lot of expectations everybody won
7373716 i put it on paper yes i predicted it and did i really believe it jim im not sure i had my doubts because theres so little room for error in our sport and you saw it in so many different races there but hes trained for this moment for so long hes had all these ups and downs through a career he went through the same thing in athens he won seven golds it should have been eight at the world championships a year ago i really felt like coming in he had the ball rolling and i thought he was going to do it
7373717 i do believe hes going to come back to london i do believe hes going to swim at least five events hes got to because there are three relays and theyre going to desperately need him in all three relays the united states will im guessing two individual events hell be in five or six events again and probably stick with the freestyles
7373718 i think she should do it why not i mean shes swimming well shes second in the world by one one hundredth of a second shes the best american sprinter that the united states has why not i mean this is her job shes very good at it and until she proves otherwise she should go for it
7373719 how many olympic games have you covered 14 havent you seen that over and over and we see that so much in athletics inches and hundredths of a second but after 14 olympic games you see it over and over but i dont think any of it was exemplified more than here in beijing jim ive never seen anything like this ever before in my life especially the drama surrounding phelps 7th gold and his one one hundredth of a victory and dara being 41 but the game of life is sometimes decided like that and it certainly was in the pool
7373720 everybody did though everybody swam under the radar phelps took the air out of everybody and to no fault of her own whats really interesting about natalie is the fact that she has swum 11 times in the olympic games two olympic games and she has won 11 medals and that is unbelievable and she certainly deserves some amazing credit shes had an incredible performance
7373721 you root for a guy like jason lezak because hes a very very nice person hes a great guy hes a journeyman hes a 32 year old guy whos been on two losing relays from 2000 and 2004 and hes fed up with it heres a guy that the adrenaline really flows jim when you get into a situation where he was a second faster than he has ever been in his life and when youre put into a situation like that adrenaline can cause some amazing things and it certainly did for him forever and ever hes going to be known as the hero of that relay
7373722 the americans exceeded all expectations no one believed in them these players were together for ten years with very little funding and the fact that they could hang together and get into the gold medal match was a huge success for them
7373723 this is the most important thing in iceland today everything is shut down just to watch the game
7373724 blessed are the gate crashers who push over every restraint in their made dash to grab hold of life and hope to find in their delirious hands joy

7373732 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
7373733 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched

7373739 im leaning more towards obama and thats because of both oprahs support and what ive seen of him
7373740 john mccain who despite the hype doesnt seem to know as much about foreign affairs
7373741 mccain recently talked at length about problems on the iraq pakistan borders the countries are a thousand miles apart asked how to deal with darfur he mused about bringing pressure on the government of somalia uh

7373743 i dont want to say we decided to go the trilogy way but we decided to take a certain chunk of the first like 14 issues and make that the first movie so we kind of gave it a different arc where this series ends hopefully would be like the third movie
7373744 we figured theres just so much excuse my language so much great s t in there that as we were developing it and what i think sort of hurt it before even as i was talking to writer brian k

7373769 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7373770 if only those must be the two saddest words in the world
7373771 i guess the final piece came when i went to lunch with a friend of mine and him and he had sally his wife with him at the hyde park grill
7373772 just to see him with sally was important i always have been a guy that judges people by their relationships to see the two of them that way i really had a lot of respect for him not only as a coach but as a person i think the next day or the day after that we had the press conference to announce that i was staying
7373773 what you do is try to win every game every year thats what you do thats what the people want here and thats what i was hired for we used to talk about how young people are and who was hurt but none of that matters if a guys at texas he should be able to play

7373779 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7373780 we dont have any concrete informations on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7373781 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7373782 prudence is required in somalia where the situation is complex and journalists and humanitarian aid workers are often abducted by militias acting with very diverse motives
7373783 the people of new york should be proud of the governor

7373786 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7373787 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7373788 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7373789 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7373790 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7373791 we commend to your fatherly goodness all who are in any way afflicted or distressed
7373792 and as for me this is my covenant with them
7373793 my spirit that is upon you and my words that i have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth or out of the mouth of your offspring or out of the mouth of your childrens offspring

7373795 one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7373796 security at the border was extraordinary involving several hundred military personnel
7373797 they cleared the border and taxis because this individual was suspected to have been involved in a very violent crime and also was believed to have ties to a drug trafficking cartel
7373798 we have been actively seeking this fugitive since the brutal slayings 10 years ago
7373799 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times

7373801 fisheries probably provide more jobs but mining is year round jobs with higher incomes
7373802 even the tiniest hint that this fish isnt safe is detrimental to the price of my fish
7373803 if people think the fish could be contaminated they wont buy it the timing of this couldnt be worse just as we are trying to salvage our industry
7373804 my friends up there are scared about this winter especially with the gas prices up
7373805 most of the year they just shoot a moose and a bear and wait for the state oil dividends they need jobs everythings ailing
7373806 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community
7373807 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more
7373808 we had a celebration in the neighborhood and you could see the scenes of festivity everywhere
7373809 people thought that i was injured because i was covered with blood but it wasnt from my injuries it was of others only god saved me
7373810 unfortunately i think i saw what i already knew if we try to throw the ball around youre going to get penalties youre going to get the quarterback hit and hes going to be running around a lot and youre going to be in trouble
7373811 when you look at it guys drop that many passes in a game
7373812 i saw that right away with gene because i was the one who recommended that he be my alternate as a player rep he fought me for a while saying no i dont want anything to do with it but when i got elected to the executive board to the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
7373813 they owe him his loyalty his dedication his determination to fight for the players and thats what he did for the old players and the new players they have to realize the things that he went through as a player trying to get things done to better it for the players coming out today things like that really stick out in my mind players should realize the impact he had on their lives and the older players lives
7373814 in the nfl you dont find too many players playing that position who would go in the hall of fame right away gene was eligible within five years and he went in right away so i used to tease him because i went in earlier than he did i said well he might make it we knew all along when mr davis drafted gene upshaw we knew that we had an extraordinary type of ball player and that would be set in that particular spot for the rest of his career thats why we drafted him thats why we saw the things that mr davis did a lot of people didnt go into those small schools at that time but mr davis had the intuition and the idea knowing that getting him would be a great player and he didnt have to worry about that spot any longer one other reason was that in the league the kansas city chiefs had a player by the name of buck buchanon who was my teammate at grambling so we needed somebody to control buck buchanon thats the first thing that mr davis thought in his mind a guy like gene upshaw can contain him can stop him
7373815 being a rookie i made him do all the extra duties go out and get my car washed wash my clothes make the bed and go cook when we needed to eat that was the thing about gene he just did everything i wanted him to do as a rookie he tried to roll over me a couple of times when he tried to roll around and i tricked him we didnt speak for a couple of days because he got me blind sided one time being roommates id walk in the room and hed go to sleep or hed leave or hed walk in and id leave for a couple of days we went through that
7373816 obviously a very tragic loss for everyone in the nfl especially the raiders was such a great player here meant so much to this organization as well as being a great person too there are so many things that hes done but the thing that sticks out to me is that everyone who has been around here before with him my few interactions with him a quality person and has meant so much to older players as well as younger players
7373817 it was a real shock waking up this morning and hearing that gene had passed away and it was such a shock because we all talk about raiders and raider family and team being family and when something like this happens you realize that you really are family today we lost someone in our family gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football in that he is obviously going to be missed he was respected by everyone because as a player he was a tough guy and as the union head he was a tough guy but he was also smart and he could compromise and he could make things happen this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
7373818 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
7373819 and well come after him every snap and put a bounty in the locker room on him
7373820 its still something really hard to do to be able to tackle with that
7373821 what i miss the most is i know he can tackle i wish he was back there returning kickoffs for us and getting through rookie mistakes back there right now
7373822 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
7373823 today the shell family and the entire football world is deeply saddened
7373824 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
7373825 that was disappointing because it was third down and it wasnt even a hard count
7373826 that has been talked about this offseason a lot with them and its somewhere that we have to improve and through two games in the preseason we have improved in that we need to continue to improve in that
7373827 if you look at the breakdown of our offensive line penalties where were they third down fourth quarter and especially on the road
7373828 well what is that well thats crowd noise and thats being tired so we try to put them in those situations as much as we can
7373829 you can say as much as you want ball gone ball gone when its got to be gone but its not the same as getting hit in the back of the head when you hold onto it too long thats why were playing him a lot in the preseason
7373830 i normally wouldnt play that offensive line that long because im so worried about those guys with injuries
7373831 but they need to play with jamarcus because you cant put jamarcus in there with the seconds
7373832 i dont how many today probably seven drops today and a number of them with our frontline guys
7373833 so well see well come out here tomorrow and the plan is for these guys to play a lot in the game and get some shots to produce
7373834 the thing coach told me in high school was the best play is the next play when you still have the ball
7373835 as far as being on the run just try not to make any dumb decisions just have the ball for the next play keep the chains moving and get some positive yards
7373836 theres nothing telling us that theres going to be surgery
7373837 i said what i said and its the situation it is to keep dwelling on it is not going to do us any good
7373838 no i dont really talk to him too much about it because unless youve been here you dont understand it so he doesnt really have any advice for me
7373839 borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
7373840 when we first got ricky on the field i went back into our meetings with our coaches and i couldnt even understand why the guy was here watching him
7373841 you really understand how the defense works now its about recognizing the formation and doing my job
7373842 im putting in a game plan and he should see some balls early in this game hopefully hell make some plays
7373843 in the end if it becomes something where javon is not playing as well as we need him to play both of those guys have learned x so they can go over there
7373844 i dont feel the need to do that right now
7373845 for him to not go out there and make those plays its discouraging
7373846 he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top 5 receivers in the nfl so we need him to make those plays
7373847 either things werent there or a guy wasnt making a play for him
7373848 its something that especially with as good as our back four can cover with our two corners and out two safeties the more we can do to create more sacks and turnovers which were categories we werent very good at last year
7373849 to put it in jamarcus hands and telling him after the drive this is how were going to throw the ball
7373850 the good thing about this staff is theyre brutally honest
7373851 i think thats good it hurts some guys egos but thats the way it is youre either in or out
7373852 its the preseason but when it comes to that first game youll know what type of team you are
7373853 they kept telling me push push push that was fun a lot of fun
7373854 oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7373855 the palestinians shouldnt think well enable them to bring in another karine a in the future
7373856 these palestinian supporters who have endured hardship to deliver their message to the world and to express their objection to the harsh siege on gaza deserve every support and appreciation
7373857 o receio era das chamas atingirem a cadeia dos morros e destru rem a mata do parque
7373858 when such and such is over things will be back to normal and ill have more time
7373859 when ive got such and such organised ill be ok ill have more time
7373860 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response by the police
7373861 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7373862 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7373863 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7373864 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7373865 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7373866 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7373870 one of the most important things that we can garner as a native american tribe is true u s citizenship
7373871 the indian naturalization act would automatically naturalize us thereby making us legal constitutional citizens of the united states and affording us all protections and rights under the constitution of the untied states

7373876 radio broadcasters have two fundamental businesses they are content developers and they are spectrum owners in the digital world both are precious and actions must be taken to maximize their value
7373877 that means distributing it as widely as possible over all those new digital pipes stream it podcast it p2p it download it to mobile phones use the new technology to create compelling websites and web services better connect to and customize for listeners and provide extra value to advertisers in doing so broadcasters can generate incremental revenue and build their brand and listener relationships
7373878 let me be clear hd radio technology is not the silver bullet that will solve all the industrys woes you dont just flip a switch on that new digital exciter and party like its 1999 broadcasters will have to do all they historically have done to compete program sell promote manage costs and develop online businesses but there is no question that hd radio technology is part of the solution look at every other industry that has gone digital and how much it has improved its position

7373891 the ecb board made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7373892 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at yesterdays teleconference
7373893 the ecb board recognises the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy tournament and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7373894 in about three years commercial planes will fly from new york to california in one hour
7373895 that would usually be sufficient to exchange fluid and qualify as sex
7373896 yes sir because they increase their chance of transmitting an infection such as hiv
7373897 its justifying its current gay blood ban policy using some of the grossest and most offensive myths and stereotypes around
7373898 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
7373899 when you ask australians a straightforward honest question youre likely to get a straightforward honest answer
7373900 i think were talking about a one in 100 risk of death on the one hand with using old blood and about a one in a million risk of hiv on the other much rarer than getting struck by lightning
7373901 the red cross lawyer also took a page out of the anti gay christian lobbys strategy stating gay male monogamy was a myth
7373902 the study shows male monogamy is a myth so if it is who are all the heterosexual males having relations with if not women
7373903 there were large numbers of police in the area on friday and saturday night which is a good thing but were still concerned
7373904 the court judgment is vindication of the citys commitment to balancing the needs of residents and the night time economy of our city
7373905 it reaffirms that late trading hours are a privilege for those premises that have shown ongoing good management practices and not a right
7373906 until the management of this hotel show an ongoing level of compliance over a reasonable period of time then i would respectfully submit that the development consent trading hours are reviewed and strong consideration be made for the trading hours to be reverted to standard trading hours for hotels
7373907 please do not stress everyone operations will continue exactly as per usual same security guards same bar staff even same door girl
7373908 a number of other pedestrians came to the rescue of the victim and surrounded the basher who continued to taunt everyone with suck my dick faggots
7373909 im gay and your not allow the touch me its the law
7373910 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7373911 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7373912 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7373913 it was agreed pakistan would retain the right to host the event next year but that if at a certain time any members still had reservations then the iccs board would have the right to relocate the event
7373914 every one of our members wishes to ensure the icc champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7373915 todays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7373916 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7373917 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
7373918 no longer do you have to risk wandering the backstreets of cabramatta to find good vietnamese street food
7373919 you can now get premium quality vietnamese at a reasonable price right in the heart of the city
7373920 organic companies have been small and focused on product development in the past now as we emerge onto supermarket shelves and contribute more resources to marketing people are starting to sit upright and say this is fantastic how long have you been doing this
7373921 by doing things slightly differently with a focus on high quality and organic ingredients organic processors naturally end up with innovative products that blend other unique attributes gluten free vegan allergy safe carbon neutral and so on
7373922 good food processing is now about showing the way and thinking outside the square rather than following other people
7373923 its a big task and a big investment but were committed to high quality products that look at the whole picture this is the way of the future
7373924 we dont add preservatives additives or sugars to childrens convenience meals there was no product doing what ours do providing convenient nutrition for fussy eaters and children with allergies
7373925 its about nourishing twists on old favourites handmade macaroni with mascarpone cheese or mini cottage pie with kumera mash for example
7373926 it may very well be that as phones become more like small computers able to access the web and deliver email without being out of reach and data costs continue to decline even small scale farmers will eventually begin to be able to take advantage of more sophisticated data delivery projects could for example send detailed information via email to farmers as opposed to the short text that sms allows
7373927 he has been as valuable a player as we have on our team
7373928 he has played with such maturity and smarts you can see it in his play but if you could hear him talk to our team and talk to the other big guys in practice in games and on the bench
7373929 in this tournament we are seeing an already outstanding player raise his game to another level im very proud of him he has been a real man for us
7373930 i know i can score the basketball but that wasnt my duty
7373931 i had to realize that as a basketball player and do everything i could to affect the game some way
7373932 i think sometimes you have to have someone behind the scenes who does the little things
7373933 you have to keep everybody motivated if we come out flat im not afraid to say something if were not playing well i have to pick everybody up
7373934 weve been waiting for this for a long time personally its as big as you can get this only comes once every four years and now i can join that elite class of gold medalists
7373935 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7373936 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7373937 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7373938 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7373939 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7373940 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7373941 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7373942 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7373943 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7373944 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7373945 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7373946 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7373947 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7373948 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7373949 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7373950 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7373951 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7373952 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7373953 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7373954 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7373955 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7373956 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7373957 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7373964 on behalf of the minister of justice it is a great privilege to personally recognize dedicated officers who work hard to make communities safer by providing youth with opportunities to make smart choices
7373965 the youth criminal justice system must instil in young people a sense of responsibility for criminal behaviour but it must also provide meaningful opportunities for rehabilitation this years winner has made significant contributions these twin goals

7373977 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7373978 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7373979 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7373980 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7373981 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7373982 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7373983 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7373984 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7373985 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7373986 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7373987 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7373988 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7373989 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7373990 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7373991 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7373992 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7373993 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7373994 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7373995 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7373996 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7373997 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7373998 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7373999 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7374000 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7374001 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7374005 i started exploring things i always wanted to do and ended up working evenings as a sous chef coordinator for three years
7374006 i couldnt find what i was looking for so i just created it
7374007 i wanted to be able to look for jobs that fit my schedule i had many conversations with friends and other amazing women who faced the same challenge
7374008 we see it as an attempt to engage a valuable and untapped workforce moms who opt out for a few years that could add to the productivity of our region
7374009 i gained a support network and ive learned new approaches to market the business
7374010 we share ideas once a month in person for what we consider a moms night out its nice to be able to shoot an e mail to one of them and get a response with words of wisdom theyre like virtual co workers people i can share wins and losses with

7374015 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7374016 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7374017 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7374018 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7374019 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7374020 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7374021 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7374022 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7374023 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7374024 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7374025 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7374026 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7374027 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7374028 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7374029 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7374030 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7374031 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7374032 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7374033 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7374037 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7374038 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7374039 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7374040 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7374041 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7374042 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7374043 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7374044 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7374045 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7374046 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7374047 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home

7374050 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7374051 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7374052 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7374053 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7374151 there are countless people who betray christianity individuals who turn their backs on its message because they no longer believe in it or because it asks too much of them but there are a few who betray christianity not because they no longer believe in it but because they believe in it so deeply because they understand that unless the seed of our christianity falls to the ground and dies it will remain a single seed but if it is allowed to die it will produce many seeds the cost of christianity for so many is thought to lie in the demand that we die to ourselves for the sake of our christianity the cross we are called to carry is thus one upon which we are to be put to death but what if this cross we bear had another meaning what if the cross that we are called to carry is not for us at all but rather like the cross that simon of cyrene labored beneath is really for another a cross for us to crucify what we love is it possible that the cross we labor beneath must be used to crucify our christianity how many of us can truly understand this question how many of us can really know what it is like to destroy what we love for the sake of what we love to be the most faithful of betrayers yet perhaps it is precisely this that we are being called to engaging in that most difficult task of putting our religion to death so that a religion without religion can spring forth

7374238 noi am asigurat tensiunea necesara functionarii nocturnei deci vina nu ne apartine probabil e din cauza instalatiei de pe stadion acum nu am avut o echipa de interventie la stadion nesolicitindu ni se acest lucru insa pe viitor vom avea
7374239 instalatia noastra nu are nici o problema cauza defectiunii este caderea de tensiune care a aparut pe ambele surse de alimentare
7374240 era lumina suficienta putea sa dea drumul la joc si nu se intimpla asa ceva
7374241 nelule jocul trebuia sa inceapa aveati la dispozitie o ora sa refaceti nocturna uitati va in roaf la articolul 18

7374243 kovacs trebuia sa se astepte 60 de minute pana sa fluiere finalul meciului a fost neregulamentar cum s a procedat acolo dar a fost o mare problema acolo pentru ca atunci cind s a modificat roaf pe 2008 cei care au redactat cartea au uitat sa transcrie si litera d de la articolul 44 acum ramine ca aceasta speta sa fie judecata de comisia de disciplina

7374246 vom face o analiza dar problemele nu au fost la mine nu am avut tensiune cind a primit tensiune instalatia a functionat la parametri normali de ce nocturna a mers inainte de meci timp de 40 de minute si dupa ce a primit tensiune a mai mers doua ore daca este o problema la un fier de calcat si sar sigurantele cind le pui la loc si fierul e tot defect nu sar iar sigurantele la noi a mers cind am avut tensiune
7374247 trebuie sa vedem ce s a intimplat pentru ca am fost prejudiciati din mai multe puncte de vedere nu imi imaginez cum nu au putut sa porneasca instalatia vom face expertize impreuna cu parchetul sa vedem care a fost cauza pentru care s a intrerupt si cauza pentru care nu a pornit la timp este si o problema de imagine pentru iasi

7374269 obviously the idea was to make the playoffs more valuable
7374270 trust me we looked at it so many different ways our heads were spinning
7374271 i was hesitant to weight the playoffs this heavily to be honest
7374272 its incredible i still think its still influencing people whats funny is how many people just bit our style that was a no no back in the day but its what the music industry does they give you a duplicate but its never as good as the original they took it and warped it
7374273 it was what we saw all around us in los angeles gangsta to us didnt have anything to do with al capone and stuff like that its just about living your life the way you want to live it and youre not going to let nothing stop you
7374274 we were just tired of them they take advantage of the communities they patrol especially poor ones so it was like enough is enough we have to say something before we did that song the police could do no wrong but after that song came out and the rodney king situation reinforced what we were saying their conduct started being scrutinized

7374281 look i can afford to pay three bucks for this ridiculous drink
7374282 it is perceived as a drink that improves performance which some people take to mean sexual performance
7374283 there was something oddly unfocused and inconsistent about the red bull message the company really never offered any rational explanation of what the stuff was all about and who was supposed to drink it
7374284 each group simply thinks red bull is something for them partly because they have never been told otherwise
7374285 murky is why rumors are not a corporate headache they help
7374286 the significance of the material things and symbols that mean the most has always flowed from us to the object not the other way around
7374287 its not just about what a product is made of or what its supposed to do

7374294 help carry out obamas agenda of change in a broken washington

7374308 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7374309 chelsea didnt at any stage look like they were going to romp it like they did against portsmouth last week

7374322 when everybody knows a guy is good and theyve done some things in the game plan to take him out and he still gets his yards hes really good
7374323 i mean i wasnt no high class gang banger or anything like that

7374409 if we fall into their tempo it is going to be a long night for us so we have to go there and be very disciplined
7374410 if we are disciplined and organised then im sure we can get a couple of goals i remember playing in a similar game for ajax against brondy we drew 2 2 in denmark and thought we had one foot in the champions league group stages
7374411 but they scored early on and we realised it wasnt going to be easy we needed to stay focused and in the end we got the result
7374412 we are so hungry and it is every players dream to be involved in european competition
7374413 we wont be going to ukraine to relax we believe we can get a result and we believe in ourselves
7374414 we needed a win before the uefa cup game and it is good for confidence were up into fifth place now and it has been a great week for the team i hope we can keep on winning now
7374415 it was a big moment to score my first goal at home and a very good feeling it was my first goal in more than a year its been a long time coming so i am very happy the build up was great the supporters come to see good football and we have to make sure we give it to them

7374421 i support it and the reason is simple i have found in my experience that you cannot have a solid relationship with a country based on fiction it occurred it occurred
7374422 recognition by the united states of the armenian genocide is not the final goal the real goal is the recognition of turkey of the turkish government of the armenian genocide and the establishment of a common turkish armenian understanding of the events and tragedy that took place

7374440 i remember 20 years or so ago when rev coy slandered the entire horse racing industry i knew he was a liar at that time and have never forgotten it
7374441 id then see him out at the speedway shoving all of the free food that we at the speedway he was in the state house at the time gave him into his fat face while he looked down his nose at those who dared to drink a beer its pigs like rev coy who drive many away from the gop
7374442 from what was said on wbt rev coy allegedly engaged the services of this young woman paid her with a check and then reported the check as stolen think about that if the charges are true it seems to me that rev coy wanted to steal sex from this poor woman and then have her locked away on a felony charge for which he had framed her

7374446 for i would have you know brethren that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man for i neither received it from man nor was i taught it but i received it through a revelation of jesus christ
7374447 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you he is to be accursed as we have said before so i say again now if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received he is to be accursed

7374465 the ball beat him home and 95 per cent or 100 per cent of the time theyre going to call him out
7374466 it did barely beat him there but it beat him

7374483 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7374484 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7374485 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7374486 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7374487 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7374512 the most disadvantaged people the homeless drug addicts alcoholics people with mental health issues everyone deserves a fair crack at the whip and a decent level of health care

7374518 the key message is things are going to be slightly worse rather than slightly better
7374519 there are three factors all happening at once the structural the cyclical and the structural multiplied by the cyclical
7374520 all of which makes for a pretty miserable outlook in the near term

7374529 if we can just get on a hot table well win
7374530 gambling is a healthy form of recreation and an emotional outlet
7374531 if you bet on baccarat blackjack craps poker or roulette games youre the one who declares which bets to go with which bets not to go with and youre the one who decides how much to bet on one and how much to bet on another
7374532 if you have a routine day to day job in which you have very little decision making responsibility and then go out to gamble for recreation you can change your personality entirely and that is very healthy
7374533 the excitement of winning and the disappointment of losing are very healthy its a form of exercise

7374541 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7374542 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7374543 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7374544 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7374545 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7374546 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7374547 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7374548 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7374549 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7374550 if they cant resolve the pollution problems they should stop or limit their production
7374551 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7374552 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7374553 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7374554 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7374555 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7374556 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7374557 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7374558 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7374559 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7374560 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7374561 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7374562 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7374563 we do not understand their anger because the government is rushing relief and doing everything to save them
7374564 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7374565 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7374566 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7374567 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7374568 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7374569 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7374570 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7374571 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7374572 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7374573 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7374574 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7374575 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7374576 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7374577 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7374578 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7374579 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7374580 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7374581 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7374582 weve definitely lost 20 percent of the population this year and probably more
7374583 we have rangers with them and were trying to reinforce them but the rangers are outnumbered 20 to one
7374584 its very difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal stocks
7374585 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7374586 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7374587 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7374588 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7374589 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7374590 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7374591 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7374592 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7374593 this is a historic day for the state of california
7374594 desalination will probably never be a major portion of the water supply but its going to be a critical part of a portfolio of a reliable supply
7374595 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7374596 this is a planning took where all things are going
7374597 it makes sense to address all gases that lead to climate change
7374598 the more gases you cover the greater flexibility countries have
7374599 very little is known about sources current and future emissions and atmospheric abundance of these gases
7374600 emissions in 1990 are assumed to have been close to zero but are increasing exponentially
7374601 in principle increase the demand for tradable units under the kyoto protocol
7374602 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7374603 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7374604 we are talking with more than five or six car makers
7374605 by the time matsushita has raised its capacity to 75 million ours will be well over 100 million
7374606 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7374607 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7374608 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7374609 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7374610 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7374611 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7374612 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7374613 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7374614 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7374615 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7374616 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7374617 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7374618 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7374619 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7374620 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7374621 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7374622 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7374623 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7374624 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7374625 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7374626 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7374627 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7374628 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7374629 this really confirms that this pattern has been happening already
7374630 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7374631 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7374632 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7374633 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7374634 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7374635 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7374636 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7374637 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7374638 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7374639 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7374640 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7374641 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7374642 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7374643 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7374644 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7374645 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7374646 if they cant resolve the pollution problems they should stop or limit their production
7374647 we do not understand their anger because the government is rushing relief and doing everything to save them
7374648 this really confirms that this pattern has been happening already
7374649 we are talking with more than five or six car makers
7374650 by the time matsushita has raised its capacity to 75 million ours will be well over 100 million
7374651 this is a historic day for the state of california
7374652 desalination will probably never be a major portion of the water supply but its going to be a critical part of a portfolio of a reliable supply
7374653 it makes sense to address all gases that lead to climate change
7374654 the more gases you cover the greater flexibility countries have
7374655 very little is known about sources current and future emissions and atmospheric abundance of these gases
7374656 emissions in 1990 are assumed to have been close to zero but are increasing exponentially
7374657 in principle increase the demand for tradable units under the kyoto protocol
7374658 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress toward the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7374659 i got the stuff that you want i got the thing that you need
7374660 protect someone pick a nom and pick the veto renom
7374661 i think resolving the big issues like the hydrocarbons law in a way that gives sunnis the impression that their voice is heard thats going to be important
7374662 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq
7374663 there is no doubt that it has been dire for most species and unfortunately it follows an already bad run of summers
7374664 we are really concerned about the small tortoiseshell which has been in long term decline and which seems to have reached a trough and stayed there
7374665 weather conditions impact greatly on the fortunes of butterflies the last two summers have been blighted by rain and wind that seriously affected their fortunes across the uk
7374666 yet some species have managed to overcome the odds and have had excellent flight seasons overall though it has been a dreadful butterfly year probably the worst in my 45 year experience
7374667 last year was one of the worst for many species and this year has been mixed to say the least but we expect a lot of species will continue to decline
7374668 we have set up 20 butterfly zones in areas around the country where farmers and landowners are working together to make sure butterflies have the right habitat and we have been achieving some remarkable success stories
7374669 butterflies are under threat like never before but we have the knowledge to reverse these declines we want people to help us make sure butterflies dont vanish forever
7374670 recent price cuts at the supermarket petrol pumps have so far had no effect on consumer inflation expectations
7374671 the knock on effect of this trend is that people will negotiate for higher pay rises and retailers will try harder to hike prices because the climate is more lenient towards inflation this will only hinder efforts to bring inflation under control
7374672 he has a moderate astigmatism does it run in your family
7374673 i think london will put on a great show something quite different to beijing
7374674 i wanted the children to see it and learn something
7374675 beijing was great but i think that england will do ok actually i think it will be better
7374676 it would be good if he tripped up on the carpet now
7374677 any city has their own twist on the games but with the olympic movement its all about bringing the world together as one the big thing is having a place something thats different and seeing how they welcome people from all over the world
7374678 it was pretty cool standing outside buckingham palace watching the guards some of the partygoers had their own ideas about the peculiarly british twist but london could put on the event
7374679 they need to sort that out in four years time
7374680 still we did think that they could introduce queueing and whingeing as olympic events in 2012
7374681 the women and children who take shelter here are able to eat the eggs they lay and think its fantastic
7374682 some of the children who come here have never even seen chooks before or eaten fresh eggs
7374683 its a great project and we get a lot of satisfaction from helping out
7374684 the security footage shows them looking at the entry on the other side then they have driven up and over the grass to avoid the cameras in front
7374685 they have pinched bottles of johnnie walker jack daniels and jim beam
7374686 it also looks like they have helped themselves to a few stubby holders
7374687 we have been here four years and in that time we have put a shutter on the front door and put in extra security cameras
7374688 the reality is the extra security just cant stop people like this
7374689 the car looks similar to a ute stolen from albury
7374690 it would appear that it was a spur of the moment raid
7374691 they could have taken a lot more they either got nervy or perhaps were disturbed in some way
7374692 tools that were in the stolen vehicle were found in lavington and appear to have fallen out the back of the ute
7374693 my grandmother used the same lockwood padlock to lock her letterbox and it was passed on to me when we cleaned up her things after she passed away 28 years ago
7374694 its devastating and i feel like i have been violated
7374695 to someone else they would just think it was rubbish
7374696 but to me it holds sentimental significance and i would just really like it back
7374697 hopefully the person who uprooted it has just discarded it and someone will find the letterbox and can return it to me
7374698 we also considered the community centre mechanics institute and howlong golf club but security is an issue
7374699 if it went to the community centre nobody would see it
7374700 i was outside in my front garden one afternoon last year when my back door was chiselled through and someone came inside my home and stole my handbag which had all my cards and money
7374701 the incident has left me rattled ever since and i cant stay alone in my own house any more
7374702 i have spent hundreds of dollars on security upgrades including sensor lights and a security alarm with a panic button that alerts the police
7374703 weve noticed the problem its true that users may fail to log in to itunes store right now
7374704 the tibetan culture has been massacred by the oppressive chinese government
7374705 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7374706 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7374707 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7374708 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7374709 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7374710 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7374711 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7374712 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7374713 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7374716 the liberals control the ultimate passage of so much of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them mr rudd told abc radio today
7374717 are they going to puncture a 3 7 or 6 1 billion immediate black hole into the budget at a time of global economic uncertainty
7374718 my appeal is that you are either going to be part of the responsible economic future of this country or simply play short term politics
7374719 the fight against germany has been carried out for months by every jewish community conference trade organisation by every jew in the world we shall let loose a spiritual and a material war of the whole world against germany
7374720 this discovery puts a tragic end to two weeks of anguish and despair they said
7374721 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well he told abc radio today
7374722 therefore youve got to take a hard line approach to this so theres conditionality which is that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments that the regular attendance at school by their kids as a necessary pre condition we think thats the right way to go
7374723 this is not australia and new zealand this is the forums stand that we continue to urge him to meet the commitment that he has pledged mr sikua told radio new zealand
7374724 hes had so many things like this happen to him i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise so he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7374725 theres not a lot of history there as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7374726 really none of those guys have really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7374727 ive been in this position before when i was in denver and was in his first year starting and i was the only receiver and came along
7374728 so its nothing new for me i just know what i do and i know what i can go out and bring so im just going to do that execute and make plays
7374729 i owe all of this you see to my operation of that store
7374730 he has become wealthy on our blood sweat and tears while we live a mediocre life our hard work has given him satin sheets and feather pillows while we practically sleep on potato sacks and hay bales he has done only twenty percent of the work we do but he holds almost six times more wealth than us
7374731 well if those workers dont like what theyre getting paid why dont they demand higher wages
7374732 were the real reason youve been successful were entitled to a bigger cut
7374733 any high school graduate can do your jobs there are plenty of people more destitute than you in the world i can have you replaced tomorrow probably at lower wages
7374734 no its fueled by ambition dreams and hard work all positive things about humanity
7374735 it isnt fair that someone who does a less difficult job than i do should have the same amount of stuff
7374736 but if it wasnt for capitalism you wouldnt have that fancy computer or that nice keyboard or that nice chair or that belly full of meatball sub

7374740 the doctors told us if she hadnt done this he would have died
7374741 they found these in the restroom see if they belong to
7374742 why do folks lean like them doing that will make the ball go where its supposed to
7374743 it would be to our benefit for millar to go up there and hit one out
7374744 the game probably should have been stopped after five innings
7374745 obviously me saying that is a no no but at this particular point in time theres been so many no nos i got nothing to lose that was absolutely brutal those conditions i remember fahey in the 11th inning trying to get that ground ball he went through a lake
7374746 i aint going to talk about saturday night but i didnt see him abandon the batters box
7374747 to me abandoning the batters box is making an attempt to return to the dugout i didnt see him make any inference to go toward the batters box or step out of the circle i didnt see that joe west didnt see it either he wasnt watching dont get me started i was up until 3 30 in the morning trying to get my blood pressure down
7374748 i wouldnt say i cant play until sept 1 id say they dont want me to play until sept 1 its not my call whenever they feel im ready im ready

7374759 were not looking at going out specifically for finance on this
7374760 this is more for general use of funds some of which could go into finance but certainly that is not the main area
7374761 if we decided to proceed i would imagine that wed be able to tell you whether we were going and what the details were within three four weeks maybe
7374762 the key difference with our finance company is we havent got any inter company exposures weve got no exposure to real estate at all and weve got no exposure to the used car market and theyre the areas really where these other guys have got themselves into trouble

7374781 ive never stomped before but i want to be a part of this
7374782 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds
7374783 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
7374784 while death and divorce may prevent it in too many cases the ideal situation for children is to be raised by a married mother and father proposition 8 is a positive step
7374785 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
7374786 are making the claim that if they can win they can hush the church silence the pastors and we will not be able to preach the truth as we know it
7374787 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok
7374788 i thought and kept on eating while our professor told us that indeed there were four kinds of meat and he would later tell us if we wanted to as badly as we had demonstrated to him during the class time
7374789 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7374790 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and
7374791 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city va here in this beautiful sedona that i am blessed every moment that i can spend here our condominium in phoenix ariz and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes
7374792 when i first met you i thought you were acting cold to me it took me a while to realize thats just the way you are

7374813 have lost the fine habit of enjoying church bells on a sunday morning and waking up to the sound of bells
7374814 on the contrary bell ringing has become a nuisance for many people the law now limits the ringing of church bells in exactly the same way as if they were part of an alarm system
7374815 if anyone in the parish complains about noise which they claim causes distress or damage the police now have the power to stop the bells not so long ago church bells were the signal for people to go to work and to return home to eat at midday thats all finished now
7374816 they just love pulling the bell ropes and if im alone in church and theres no one else around then i pull on the bell rope just like any other parishioner
7374817 things like search instant messaging skype podcasting wifi myspace youtube wikis peer to peer networking and web 2 0 micro applications have huge potential to radically increase knowledge worker productivity but too many it organizations are still trying to control or even prevent their use we firmly believe that these technologies and the ones to follow will power the future economy provided the it organization lets go

7374826 anzfw is seen as the most directional and up and coming fashion week we were planning a sell trip to new zealand and then we were asked to be the first australians to show so it seemed a great opportunity and an honour
7374827 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7374828 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7374829 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7374830 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7374831 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7374832 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7374833 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7374834 i think the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7374835 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7374836 i dont know what will be the team against rangers
7374837 the only thing i can say is that everybody at this club will be ready and fit mentally and physically for this game this is the best game in scotland we must be ready for the challenge
7374838 the no 1 thing is frustration anxiety knots in your stomach
7374839 you know all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it was presented on paper any of those types of things are very difficult for a coach no matter what age you are
7374840 dr warren has convinced us this repair will put him in a great shape going forward and because of that were certainly 100 percent behind the decision
7374841 we just hope the surgery goes well that it is a full recovery and that hes better than ever shortly down the road
7374842 he definitely means a lot to this team and this franchise
7374843 every time a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat
7374844 if something comes into play well talk about it until that point anything else is speculation michael loves the giants as we all know and im sure hes upset like every other giant fan at the turn of events whether that would mean hell come back as an active player wed have to have a long discussion about that
7374845 i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you im sure jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do whats best here at this point in time
7374846 i dont think its deflating this is the nfl and there are season ending injuries almost every week and we understand that
7374847 when someone does go down you have to be as positive with them as you can and at the same time youve got to move forward

7374855 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well he told abc radio today

7374857 my grandson woke me up and told me something was going on when i walked out the house was already up in flames
7374858 right now i feel like im having a nervous breakdown to tell you the truth
7374859 she was a very good person a very loving person she had a lot of friends everybody loved her
7374860 i dont know i guess i just have to take it one day at a time
7374861 more of a support from a traditional medical standpoint that people are more than their bodies
7374862 whats really neat about music is that even if i dont speak taiwanese or korean i can bring in a huge ocean drum and the child and i can move it back and forth
7374863 we dont need to speak the same language to understand one another
7374864 do you suppose this is why barack refuses to debate john
7374865 we use hope as a compass to direct our path and give substance to our vision
7374866 it is often a struggle for families who have children with special needs to make sure their kids have the best care possible
7374867 these two new programs will give hundreds more families access to support and services so they can care for their kids at home
7374868 through medicaid waivers such as these illinois is able to provide assistance to even more children and adults in need of long term health care services
7374869 under governor blagojevich we have made great strides in furthering the growth of our medicaid system and have found more ways to extend these critical health benefits to more individuals
7374870 we appreciate the support of the legislators advocates and families who helped obtain the new waivers they will enable more young people with developmental disabilities to enjoy meaningful relationships with family and friends and others in their lives and experience personal growth and development
7374871 the array of services will provide opportunities for the young people to have more choice in their services and how they live their lives

7374909 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7374910 almost half of hillary clintons voters at this moment in time say they are not prepared to vote for barack obama
7374911 thats almost half right there who arent ready to commit to obama theres frustration theres anger among a considerable chunk of hillary clinton supporters
7374912 o ur poll shows that only three in 10 arent for him
7374913 are still mad youve got this wall street journal poll that shows only 52 percent now support obama
7374914 well lets be honest chris the washington post and abc came out with a poll today that shows more than it shows 70 percent of hillary clinton voters supporting barack obama the highest water mark since she suspended her campaign in june
7374915 what the republican party ought to do is apologize to the united states of america for what they have done to it in the past eight years
7374916 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this we cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest americans while the middle class america middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
7374917 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world
7374918 we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7374919 i have never in my life seen washington so broken i have never seen so many dreams denied and so many decisions deferred by politicians who are trying like the devil to escape their responsibility and accountability but ladies and gentlemen the reckoning is now

7374941 i didnt have the luxury i suppose the certainty of the tribe i hadnt grown up in compton or watts i had nothing to escape from except my own inner doubts
7374942 in their mannerisms their speech their mixed up hearts i kept recognizing pieces of myself
7374943 and thats exactly what scared me their confusion made me question my own racial credentials all over again
7374944 i have definitely heard parents and friends who are rwandan tell me
7374945 and i am friends with african americans who will say look at those africans
7374946 my brother and sister are from kenya they have lived here for 30 years and are american citizens
7374947 they feel more comfortable hanging out with white people than african americans they feel african americans are angry all the time i have an african american friend and everything she talks about is race
7374948 but can we become so fragmented that we dont share anything
7374949 playing the role of the nonthreatening black works for me i went to boarding school and kenyon college and i have a masters degree
7374950 part of me has my fist clenched under the table
7374951 there is this feeling that black confrontational behavior wont be so acceptable we have to all play the game now
7374952 man up a plan for the spiritual and organizational retooling of black america
7374953 hasnt told us what hell do to create jobs in the inner city and create economic development
7374954 you should see the emails i get from my girlfriends
7374955 we all want someone who lifts us up and praises us obama is raising the bar for black men
7374956 the fact that he didnt says a lot its important for my boys to see a love relationship that doesnt depend on skin types they see they dont have to be with a light skinned black woman to be successful
7374957 i wouldnt give a damn about him if it wasnt for michelle
7374958 he has enough fortitude and courage to let michelle be michelle
7374959 barack and his wife are going to change a lot of views of black males
7374960 the males are going to look at barack and they will come back to the home they will be our role models
7374961 we dont see what obama and his wife are like at home when there are no cameras there
7374962 does he rub his wifes back does he take out the garbage
7374963 michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help and will do so as long as is needed on the council and advice of our executive and board after our up and coming edge conference we will take time to be with mike and get him all the professional and spiritual help he needs to come to full recovery
7374964 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7374965 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7374966 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7374967 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7374968 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions
7374969 two out of the five big pharmaceutical companies are allegedly looking into their pricing and if they are prepared to go back and look at the cost of their drugs to make them more cost effective then i welcome that
7374970 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and also for all the subsequent games i believe and i hope that london can put the bar even higher so that we have consistent improvement and evolution of the olympic games there are some things that london will not be able to compare or equal such as the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers to the different sites
7374971 it is a total disgrace that this proud night for britain has been sullied by this gross representation of london
7374972 the mayor is deeply disturbed by this offensive image being shown he has ordered the film to be pulled and not to be shown again
7374973 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7374974 london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play it is a cosmopolitan multi ethnic and multi religious city and thats something they can build on for the rest i have no concerns the venues will be fine the village will be fine the organisation will be fine
7374975 i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home sport is coming home
7374976 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7374977 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport some of the changes in china are obvious today others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7374978 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7374979 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7374980 a break up will do nothing to accelerate the delivery of that i think baa is focused on the issue
7374981 thats a big stick but at the moment its all carrot with baa
7374982 i believe the government recognises the importance to the uk of an efficient hub airport and a third runway
7374983 i believe there was a weak economic case for building a second runway at stansted but a strong case for heathrow
7374984 like criticising british energy for not building new nuclear power stations in the 1990s politically it was not going to happen
7374985 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production
7374986 instead they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries
7374987 i hope the awards will help people all over britain particularly those with a disability have improved access to the wonders of the old new beautiful and intriguing objects in englands museums and galleries
7374988 i would like to thank the dcms and the wolfson foundation for recognising our need for a gallery that will be of long term benefit to local regional and international visitors
7374989 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7374990 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7374991 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7374992 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7374993 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7374994 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7374995 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7374996 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7374997 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7374998 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7374999 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7375000 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7375001 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7375002 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7375003 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7375004 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7375005 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7375006 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7375007 what i feel missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7375008 a channel that becomes the home of the best program makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too lightly targeted an audience
7375009 we can see these channels in america whose output is much more frequently cited as the best television in the world
7375010 im not even going to begin to pretend to understand how the economics of this would work
7375011 i know wed have to give a guarantee that the content on the channel would make its way eventually onto the bbcs free to air channels and that some would need help in paying the subscription
7375012 let me tell you something ill split your expletive head open
7375013 ill split her open too ill rape that expletive ill rape your mother i will rape your mother you document that for the montgomery county sheriffs department ill rape her after i split your head open
7375014 so you expletive with me ill crack you expletive head open
7375015 you play with me expletive you get the montgomery county sheriff to come over there come on expletive you want to play with me
7375016 the tape tells it all doesnt it i dont know very many people that would be excited that that was their next door neighbor
7375017 i moved to the neighborhood for peace and quiet and good neighbors it doesnt seem like that has happened
7375018 really demonstrate to this party and the american people where they are with obamas candidacy
7375019 i like to be positive to me the glass is half full
7375020 we can go all the way during the roll call and fill it or we can go the other way and empty that which is in it
7375021 i hope we use the roll call to fill the glass of party unity before the general election campaign begins added
7375022 i think were going to hear a full throated no nonsense endorsement of
7375023 some people are unhappy but in the end were all obama supporters she said hill leaders press clintons for more obama enthusiasm
7375024 its clear they dont want an on air roll call theyre extremely nervous about this she said
7375025 it will not be done in a way that either disrupts or sends a mixed signal he said
7375026 im sure obama and clinton want it to go off without a hitch
7375027 with all due respect to the commentators and my friends in the media we didnt need to bring faith to the democratic party
7375028 surely we cannot be pleased with the routine administration of millions of surgically terminated pregnancies something within us must be calling for a better way
7375029 others loudly proclaim their advocacy for the unborn but they refuse to recognize their responsibility and the responsibility of our nation to those who have been born
7375030 its dangerous to just look at the moment in front of you and say thats the trend because the region has shifted back and forth it can be a pretty unsettling place for party regulars
7375031 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7375032 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7375033 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7375034 be careful about reading health books you may die of a misprint
7375035 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
7375036 his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7375037 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7375038 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7375039 rio has the emotional factor that the games have never been in south america
7375040 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7375041 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to healthcare john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7375042 the end is near i hear a noise at the door as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it it shall not find me god
7375043 wow its so thickly green down there youd swear it was jungle or something
7375044 by a man or a woman and more importantly did you enjoy it
7375045 the hesitation on him as a speaker was that he didnt even hold federal office yet so how prominent could he be
7375046 he was unproven but we became convinced that he also offered incredible promise
7375047 i will tell syrian officials during my prospective visit to syria that the future of french syrian relations is highly dependent on the nature of lebanese syrian ties
7375048 the visit has two aspects to it it will address lebanese palestinian relations and inter palestinian relations
7375049 we should get done with the electoral law this way we will be left with the issue of agreeing on a defense strategy for lebanon
7375050 the defense strategy will be discussed during upcoming dialogue sessions
7375051 the new army chief will be appointed from a list of favorites that was constructed according to specific technical and military criteria
7375052 only a policy of non alignment is capable of protecting lebanon
7375053 i called for reconciliation in tripoli to prevent the syrian regime from using such a pretext

7375078 we heard a loud noise and thought there had been an accident but when we went outside there was lots of smoke and we saw someone escaping towards the south of the city
7375079 an isolated incident with no direct relation to brazil there were no previous threats and no local group has yet claimed responsibility
7375080 along with better information analysis these preventative measures will allow a more specialized intelligence group to work on the material
7375081 the gap between telstra market will close over time if pay increases are policy based
7375082 it shows that as a result of the collective agreement that telstras average pay is the best in the industry but the company wants to reduce the gap by offering smaller wage increases
7375083 it shows primarily the aim of the game is to reduce labour costs and that means people are going to have a reduction in their take home pay and their conditions of employment
7375084 telstra is a real live example of the need for a proper collective bargaining regime to be in place telstra has been prepared to flout the decision of the australian people last year thats why we need the legislation in place as quickly as possible so we at least ensure telstra is required to bargain in good faith they havent done that
7375085 we have always said we will protect those for existing employees thats exactly what well do

7375089 we want the interior minister to come to where everything is happening
7375090 we want the law to be respected and an end to the impunity of these armed terrorist groups
7375091 the state is the one responsible for the conflict and it needs to start paying attention and sorting it out so that temucos citizens can live and work in peace
7375092 they dragged eduardo luchsinger threw him down the stairs took him outside and burned all his property we cant wait until theres killing to take the bull by the horns and solve these problems
7375093 when demands are not met and they start to accumulate it creates prime conditions for harsher demonstrations which could be detrimental to the public safety
7375094 citizens should feel calm and have confidence in their police force because we are working on the situation
7375095 the speed with which the government and the national agricultural society put the blame on the mapuche astonishes me
7375096 it stigmatizes mapuche organizations and tries to undermine the mapuches legitimate territorial cultural and political demands
7375097 i would like to firmly condemn the incendiary attacks that occurred in region ix because i am sure that these incidents were done by delinquents and have nothing to do with the mapuche nation
7375098 we are four brothers and have just nine hectares of land
7375099 on this we have to grow food for ourselves provide grazing for our animals it is not enough
7375100 to have a military tank in my municipality left me indignant
7375101 it affected me a lot because it is not something common in chile at this time in a dictatorship they do these things but as the mapuche are indigenous people democracy allows it they wouldnt do this in the big urban population of santiago there would be scandal
7375102 it is an unacceptable provocation this practically military presence with tanks a police bus helmets submachine guns rifles is something that i have never seen in the three terms i have spent as a parliamentarian and as president of the commission of human rights this situation is not tolerable in a diplomatic state
7375103 i believe unfortunately that if things dont change there will be an awful ending the communities are going to be in such a rage its likely that i too will participate in this action because it is not acceptable that this type of conduct goes on in our land which we recuperated with our rights the problem will not be solved like this with police this is why i invited the deputies to tir a to alert them to what is going on because at the end of the day whatever the outcome is the mapuche will be guilty this is the conclusion that will be drawn
7375104 by the breaking of the bread he makes it into a seedbed of food for if the bread had been left intact and not pulled apart and broken into pieces they would have been unable to feed the great crowds of men women and children mysteries are made manifest so that what did not feed the multitude of people in its original whole and unbroken state now feeds them in its divided state
7375105 holy holy holy is the lord almighty the whole earth is filled with his glory
7375106 my destruction is sealed for i am a sinful man and a member of a sinful race yet i have seen the king the lord almighty
7375107 see this coal has touched your lips now your guilt is removed and your sins are forgiven
7375108 whom should i send as a messenger to my people who will go for us
7375109 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right v 2 honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise v 3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth
7375110 her children stand and bless her her husband praises her
7375111 honor your father and mother then you will live a long full life in the land the lord your god will give you
7375112 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective
7375113 husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers
7375114 therefore i urge you brothers and sisters in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship 2 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
7375115 for instances one of the big catch cries we hear at present is be weary of strangers
7375116 as the lord god of israel lives before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years except at my word
7375117 go present yourself to ahab and i will send rain on the earth
7375118 i have not troubled israel but you and your fathers house have in that you have forsaken the commandments of the lord and have followed the baals 19 now therefore send and gather all israel to me on mount carmel the four hundred and fifty prophets of baal and the four hundred prophets of asherah who eat at jezebels table
7375119 how long will you falter between two opinions if the lord is god follow him but if baal follow him
7375120 i alone am left a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men 23 therefore let them give us two bulls and let them choose one bull for themselves cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it and i will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it 24 then you call on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god who answers by fire he is god
7375121 if you are willing to shoulder greater financial responsibility by pledging at least 100 over your monthly giving please stand as mrs jones plays
7375122 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well he told abc radio today
7375123 therefore youve got to take a hard line approach to this so theres conditionality which is that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments that the regular attendance at school by their kids as a necessary pre condition we think thats the right way to go
7375124 we have yet to see the evidence that this kind of approach will work
7375125 it is extremely punitive it will have an immediate and severe effect on peoples lives
7375126 what we do have evidence for is that wrap around parenting skills courses getting people to access alcohol and other drug rehabilitation services working on the causes of this kind of chaos in peoples lives is extremely effective
7375127 we have only made initial inquiries and greg has been too concerned about the girl and said he will come and see me first thing in the morning to tell me more

7375132 life is short and uncertain it is like a drop of water skittering around on a lotus leaf you never know when it will drop off the edge and disappear so each day is far too precious to waste and each day that you are not radiantly alive and brimming with cheer is a day wasted stop right now and evaluate your life your life as it is right now are you by and large and daily variations aside happier now than you have ever been do you have the inner conviction that you are on the path that is just right for you the one that is transparently leading you to fulfillment in many dimensions in your career in relationships in spiritual development if the answer is no ask yourself why not the first step to getting there is to refuse to accept anything less

7375148 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand
7375149 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7375150 in the second half of the year international crude oil pricing also reached record high levels resulting in an increase of 30 million in logistics costs
7375151 a rapid deterioration in the new zealand economy towards the end of the financial year also impacted earnings as did the weakening new zealand dollar
7375152 this was the first time in the last five years in which the business did not record double digit profit growth
7375153 the dairy business had a difficult year with rapidly escalating commodity costs resulting in raw milk costs increasing by over 60 per cent in the year

7375176 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
7375177 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
7375178 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
7375179 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
7375180 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
7375181 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price
7375182 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7375183 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7375184 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7375185 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7375186 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7375187 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7375188 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7375189 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7375198 jadi cowok yang pengen disenengin para cewek memang nggak gampang sejumlah persyaratan harus dipenuhi bukan sekedar fisik harus ganteng harus kece atau harus imut yang terpenting justru adalah sifat sifat yang menyenangkan

7375205 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7375206 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7375207 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7375208 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7375209 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7375210 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7375211 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7375212 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7375213 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7375214 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7375215 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems

7375280 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7375281 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7375282 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7375283 releasing even a portion of this carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane or carbon dioxide would have an significant impact on earths climate
7375284 many of the changes were necessary for beijings continued brisk development and the olympics served to substantially accelerate their implementation
7375285 with an improved transport system financial services infrastructure communications network and hospitality industry post olympics beijing will be better positioned to fulfill its potential as a world class metropolis
7375286 were interested in the birds nest we do have content that can fill the birds nest occasionally
7375287 shanghai is probably the most important and attractive market in the world for us right now
7375288 they resemble european city squares in the sense of how they give people a space outdoors to chat to meet up thats very useful and it is really changing the city life here
7375289 but you have to look at the costs and benefits
7375290 overall i think the gains for beijings urban landscape are more important
7375291 the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries under the carbon market mechanism has been a stormy one among delegates and observers
7375292 there is a point where it will be too late it is better we speed up to make appreciable progress in the negotiations
7375293 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7375294 the negotiations are focusing excessively on finance and not on the root causes of deforestation such as consumption of biofuels meat and timber
7375295 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions
7375296 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7375297 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7375298 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7375299 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7375300 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7375301 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7375302 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7375303 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas
7375304 they know it aggravates us so they stick gaffs in them and drag them around
7375305 they dont target sharks on a daily basis but they have to make a living
7375306 unfortunately there are sensitive people out there but a living has to be made
7375307 naturally divers get upset when after enjoying a passive interaction with sharks they see a boat full of dead sharks at the same slipway they launch from
7375308 this is not good business for the eco tourism industry
7375309 at the same time we cannot wait years for the results of the research as there will be hardly any sharks left by then
7375310 we therefore urge a precautionary approach applied to shark fisheries where data is lacking
7375311 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation
7375312 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and made mock charges at us but we kept our distance and left leaves and fruits for it to eat as the oil palm environment is not suitable for wildlife
7375313 i have a swop corner its actually a corner where i keep my unwanted and unused things and exchange them for something that i need when the opportunity arises
7375314 i hope that one day all singaporeans will adopt this culture and save the environment by exchanging their unwanted items instead of throwing them away by swopping an item with someone who needs it we are in fact reusing the item
7375315 to save the environment we can have refillable packs for all the consumable liquids
7375316 we used to do this a long long time ago when my parents went to the provision shop with a tin to buy kerosene or to buy rice and i think it could make a comeback and we could really use much less materials for our daily needs
7375317 this is one of the issues that is being studied in detail how far we can go how fast we can go what we need to do while bearing in mind that solar panel is still a new technology
7375318 it is still very expensive but i think it would be useful for us to do some test bedding of this new technology
7375319 when it comes to east timor i look forward to my discussions with the government of that country about their aspirations but remember also in east timor they are also the recipients of long term revenues from their natural resources in the timor sea
7375320 east timor is also the receipient of other development assistance and cooperation from australia
7375321 we want to have a proper and reasonable trial of this program which is why weve embarked on a modest 2 500 workers scheme over a three year period and we will be evaluating that on the way through
7375322 help me get out and vote for me i know how the system works
7375323 yippie doo yippie doo and jesus was his name o
7375324 its been disappointing for us because you know weve tried to get them to do things make security a lot more visible on campus but so far its you know the response has been quite disappointing
7375325 im not just going into this episode as a bushfire candidate but believe you me the bushfires are still a big issue in the community and needs to be addressed
7375326 the chief minister done the wrong thing with the communities over the bushfires and he needs to still come up with the answers here
7375327 the time is ripe theyre sick of the stanhope government theyre sick of the arrogance of majority government
7375328 your father sent us to you to collect his gun
7375329 for the last time tell me where the gun is before i shoot you
7375330 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and also for all the subsequent games i believe and i hope that london can put the bar even higher so that we have consistent improvement and evolution of the olympic games there are some things that london will not be able to compare or equal such as the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers to the different sites
7375331 it is a total disgrace that this proud night for britain has been sullied by this gross representation of london
7375332 the mayor is deeply disturbed by this offensive image being shown he has ordered the film to be pulled and not to be shown again
7375333 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7375334 london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play it is a cosmopolitan multi ethnic and multi religious city and thats something they can build on for the rest i have no concerns the venues will be fine the village will be fine the organisation will be fine
7375335 i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home sport is coming home
7375336 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7375337 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport some of the changes in china are obvious today others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7375338 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7375339 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7375340 hey a few things in this past week made me think of you so i thought id say hi
7375341 i sure do miss mine it is next door to where we live in west palm beach the name is
7375342 this is the year people will finally understand how useful these wan performance optimizers can be
7375343 blah blah its taking between 10 and 20 days to get the phones blah blah and then you can come in and well activate your phone
7375344 wait a minute 10 to 20 days i thought it took 7 days
7375345 no we cant really be sure when well get the phone but were averaging 10 to 20 days sometimes more
7375346 this is a test message testing 1 2 3 click goodbye
7375347 how long does it take to process one iphone customer
7375348 to capture screens on your iphone or ipod touch 2 0 hold down the home button on the front of the iphone and press the on off button at the top of the device your display will flash briefly and your screen capture will appear in your photo store
7375349 one of the app stores most popular pieces of software is remote an application that allows iphone and ipod touch users to control itunes or apple tv from their beloved devices if you wish to extend your iphone based control beyond those applications to your desktop as a whole youll be pleased to know that a client for the popular vnc virtual network computing server the client called mocha vnc lite is freely available from the app store and is fairly easy to use
7375350 they say its the best way to get rid of all your worries and troubles get on a bike and youre riding and you forget everything but the wind blowing in your face its like youre in a different world
7375351 were really excited its a really big milestone here at the dealership we have live music weve got food vended by rhythm and brews which is a local business here
7375352 harley davidson was promoted this year all over the country and we wanted to do our own tie in of the celebration if anyone knows triple s were know for our events here we do it right every time
7375353 have lost the fine habit of enjoying church bells on a sunday morning and waking up to the sound of bells
7375354 on the contrary bell ringing has become a nuisance for many people the law now limits the ringing of church bells in exactly the same way as if they were part of an alarm system
7375355 if anyone in the parish complains about noise which they claim causes distress or damage the police now have the power to stop the bells not so long ago church bells were the signal for people to go to work and to return home to eat at midday thats all finished now
7375356 they just love pulling the bell ropes and if im alone in church and theres no one else around then i pull on the bell rope just like any other parishioner
7375357 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
7375358 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
7375359 oh ive made so many of those in my career its hard to keep up with all of them
7375360 ive made so many mistakes in my career youd think i was trying to make things hard on myself
7375361 everybody makes mistakes i guess ive just made a few more but every mistake ive made has brought me here so it couldnt have been that bad
7375362 texas is a very polished team that has great talent texas has never been a really tough team physically tough team and thats what weve got to be when my defense will get to the point where i think itll get well be mean nasty ornery bastards and thats what you need to beat texas
7375363 theyll throw you tit for tat run the ball outside option throw theyll move the ball we can go out there with our defense and make them pay a price every time they catch one of those dinky passes get about three hats on him and make him not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
7375364 i was trying to talk about how talented of a team texas was and people took it the wrong way
7375365 namath came to me on the sideline and said coach i think i can sneak it in
7375366 i remember telling him to go do it then so namath goes out there and jumps and this linebacker comes out of nowhere and just stuffs him
7375367 we used to look at games like this when we played florida or south florida or texas as advanced training camp games
7375368 we knew we didnt have a chance to win so we just looked at them as preparation for our conference schedule it was advanced training camp
7375369 but this isnt advanced training camp anymore we quit playing advanced training camp games now were going to challenge everybody for victories
7375370 leva um ter o no bolso da cal a e dorme com um outro debaixo do travesseiro desde que passou por uma opera o no c rebro
7375371 eu vestia um terno azul claro e jill me pediu para vestir um escuro a na pressa

7375375 apesar das derrotas nosso grupo fechado unido todo mundo se ajudando para que a gente saia dessa situa o
7375376 a gente est buscando o equilibro entre a marca o o poder ofensivo e principalmente na parte emocional quando levarmos o gol tivermos uma situa o adversa a gente possa continuar jogando da mesma forma com o mesmo entusiasmo vibra o
7375377 achei que o atl tico teve muito mais equil brio no primeiro tempo at os 25 minutos o time esteve muito bom com a marca o firme n o deixando o contra ataque para o atl tico pr criando at os cinco minutos pelo menos tr s boas chances de cruzamento na rea que acabamos n o aproveitando mantivemos esse n vel durante todo o jogo com oscila o no fim do primeiro tempo
7375378 um passo importante essa vit ria al m de ser contra um concorrente direto n s marcamos v rios gols e n o levamos por a que a gente tem que seguir

7375387 i thought that if i could help barack obama get to washington
7375388 one thing i came to realize early in the process of working with barack was he was always going to be the best writer in the room
7375389 david axelrod and david plouffe have run maybe the best campaign in my lifetime beating the clintons wasnt easy and they did it
7375390 id been thinking about what i wanted to do in terms of the performing arts
7375391 i wanted to extend myself somehow in the grand tradition of agnes de mille and jerry robbins what do choreographers like myself do who want to go deeper in our field or even sideways musical theater seems to be the answer
7375392 it became clear if this was going to have a life other than the dance world i come from i would have to understand the conventions of the commercial stage and tell a story i had to figure out whom i wanted to talk to and i realized it was a theatergoing person i dont get many african americans people of my background in audiences for my dance performances in our previews im already finding that mix and it makes me feel less isolated less cynical
7375393 he left a catalog that is as rich as duke ellingtons
7375394 he dealt with local issues that are universal and as relevant today i believe hes a major composer of the 20th century
7375395 fela impressed me from a very young age so to experience his spirit this way is a profound experience
7375396 bill is fascinating to work with and his process is very rigorous hes teaching me how to communicate through gesture he gives all kinds of information verbally but what makes him different from other directors is his deep understanding of how much one can convey physically
7375397 were communicating all night long with sahr and the rest of the cast
7375398 in africa we are always losing things our tempers our people our minds
7375399 but i thought i should show the transition from lashing out at friends to talking to the audience
7375400 you have to change immediately from fury to offering an eloquent explanation of the ugly state of affairs in your country
7375401 we have more czech grandmothers in our orchestra than they do in theirs
7375402 weirdly provocative stagings by arrogant directors who think that innovation means boring the audience using public funds
7375403 from the bottom to the top a line of equality of beauty of facility and at the same time of emotion
7375404 go on the stage every night with the same feeling we are afraid
7375405 i didnt think twice i had to cancel another engagement but did it with pleasure this is a great great honor for me
7375406 and the second was luciano pavarotti i remember listening to recordings and hearing the sun in his voice the clarity and free emission and understanding every single word
7375407 ms fleming and i were unknown just up and coming new artists since then i couldnt believe how generous he was with every single young singer and he was always a great colleague onstage very demanding of course very severe with everybody because he wanted the best
7375408 which can really help when you approach a heavier role he used to tell us that every time he was singing turandot or il trovatore or la forza del destino it was healthy for him to go back and sing bel canto
7375409 the role was perfect for his particular voice the things that ive never heard from anyone else are the passages when hes singing the hostias he was so beautiful and moving that every time i think about it i get goose bumps it is written in e flat almost in the passagio role but the way he sang that in pianissimo it was so clear and sad that he really made you cry
7375410 hed pick up the phone and sing to me marcello finalmente
7375411 just a couple of months before he died he still had the energy to call me marcelo finalmente in a singing way it will remain in my soul forever
7375412 by the time i was old enough to choose i never had the choice
7375413 the adventures of guille and belinda and the enigmatic meaning of their dreams

7375459 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand
7375460 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7375461 in the second half of the year international crude oil pricing also reached record high levels resulting in an increase of 30 million in logistics costs
7375462 a rapid deterioration in the new zealand economy towards the end of the financial year also impacted earnings as did the weakening new zealand dollar
7375463 this was the first time in the last five years in which the business did not record double digit profit growth
7375464 the dairy business had a difficult year with rapidly escalating commodity costs resulting in raw milk costs increasing by over 60 per cent in the year
7375465 aggressive cost recovery initiatives resulted in the business taking four price rises but inevitable timing lags and a growth in private label sales had a negative impact on margins
7375466 the market is following on from wall street on friday night and reporting season coming in near enough to expectations macquarie private wealth divisional director martin lakos said

7375488 acho que fiz uma boa estr ia normalmente em estr ias os jogadores sentem problemas de entrosamento e de cansa o mas comigo hoje foi diferente lamento o gol sofrido no fim do jogo mas comemoro pelo futebol apresentado por mim e por todos os companheiros
7375489 confesso que me surpreendi pela capacidade f sica dele n o imaginei que ele conseguiria ag entar o tempo inteiro o hamilton tomou o cart o amarelo e foi amea ado pelo rbitro que disse que o expulsaria no lance seguinte mas ele soube se segurar em campo e conseguiu terminar o jogo sem tomar o cart o vermelho
7375490 achei curioso ele comentar isso o edmundo disse que faltou vontade n o pelo contr rio tivemos dificuldades tivemos o sabor amargo pode ser s para ele pois eu gostei muito da equipe hoje mas ficamos satisfeitos pois est vamos perdendo e empatamos
7375491 o botafogo est junto h dois anos sab amos q seria dif cil o time deles veio com algumas contrata es que encaixaram muito bem por exemplo o gil e o carlos alberto no fim o resultado foi importante e premiou os atletas
7375492 eu alertei aos jogadores quando entramos nos acr scimos que o jogo estava acabando faltou um pouco de concentra o e de malandragem para eles que mesmo garantindo um bom resultado queriam jogar r pido teve um lateral que o felipe quis bater com velocidade e acabou perdendo a bola
7375493 existem alguns jogos nesse campeonato que o placar m nimo de 1 a 0 deve ser considerado como goleada est vamos jogando contra o l der da competi o e com o time muito desfalcado esse resultado seria o melhor poss vel mas n o conseguimos segurar e acabamos levando um gol faltando quinze segundos para o fim do jogo acho que se tiv ssemos sido mais malandro os ltimos trinta segundos n o seriam de sufoco
7375494 mostrei o dvd da batalha dos aflitos ontem noite na concentra o para que eles sentissem o clima do jogo e vissem o quanto era importante essa partida para os nossos torcedores acho que eles entenderam o recado e se doaram ao m ximo dentro de campo mas infelizmente fomos castigados com um gol no fim do jogo
7375495 no choque eu tenho 100 de certeza que n o fui eu que errei pois ele freou muito antes eu sinto muito mesmo por ter tocado nele mas realmente n o tive o que fazer
7375496 eu realmente queria sair de sonoma na ponta da tabela e consegui

7375648 the people of santa cruz should rest assured that we will stop any minister arriving in santa cruz because they are not welcome
7375649 the political effects of a radicalised position are not yet visible but they could be tremendously adverse for santa cruz
7375650 we are no longer just a simple government but rather the power of the people
7375651 the debate on the referendum must not last beyond next week
7375652 if its through a law its a law if its by decree its a decree the new constitution has to be approved and we will ensure it is approved
7375653 if some groups do not want to understand the overwhelming sentiment of bolivian people the thoughts and suffering of the majorities then surely they will continue to reduce more and more in numbers and become more violent we have an obligation to ensure order so that there is respect between bolivians
7375654 we will not allow more outrages upon our institution and much less attacks on police officers
7375655 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as us meddling in its neighborhood
7375656 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7375657 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
7375658 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7375659 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7375660 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7375661 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7375662 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7375663 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in latin america while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

7375668 i saw a couple of neighbors had out their boards measuring against the windows but they didnt put them up
7375669 we had our boards out also just to make sure they were in good shape
7375670 i was expecting a lot of rain and wind but we didnt get that
7375671 but please do not go into the water unless you are an expert swimmer
7375672 were just glad we didnt get the flooding rains the rest of the state got

7375674 juveniles should be charged as adults for violent crimes committed
7375675 it is morally wrong to place our parents in care centres
7375676 poverty in the third world is the fault of the first world
7375677 if we stay things are awful granted but if we leave my god i cant even imagine how awful it will become
7375678 ill probably catch up on a lot of sleep the next few days
7375679 it felt really good to be the world champions especially since i made the last out
7375680 there were a lot of cross ups i dont know why that was
7375681 we are the second place team in the world we should be happy we wanted to win so bad
7375682 there is another stomach for desserts its a separate space
7375683 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7375684 its inevitable that were going to use it as long as its just where home run calls and borderline calls are concerned
7375685 we just have to make sure its a system that doesnt delay the game any more
7375686 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7375687 in the meantime its something i cant control weve got a long way to go and im still looking forward to getting some more opportunities
7375688 im very blessed and very happy all the work i put into it i think its paid off but i dont want to sound selfish its not all about me its about the ballclub and winning ballgames
7375689 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7375690 what doug ruled at second base was even though a
7375691 you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7375692 he wasnt going to talk to him anymore that he was going to talk to joe
7375693 eddings thought he bumped him that willy interfered or obstructed with the runner and he gave him the extra base i disagree
7375694 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7375695 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7375696 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7375697 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7375698 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7375699 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7375700 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7375701 jen didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together
7375702 she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine
7375703 joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that
7375704 if joel would just marry nicole she wouldnt be so jealous about mary kate
7375705 but despite having a baby with her it doesnt look like joels going to truly settle down with nicole any time soon
7375706 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i
7375707 ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
7375708 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
7375709 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
7375710 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out
7375711 with all due respect to the commentators and the media we didnt need to bring faith to the party it was already here
7375712 millions of people of faith have been are and will continue to be democrat
7375713 there is absolutely in our party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
7375714 something within us must be calling for a better way
7375715 others loudly proclaim their advocacy for the unborn but they refuse to recognize their responsibility and the responsibility of our nation to those who have been born
7375716 but the bigger picture is honoring those different perspectives and being all together as we look at really complicated questions
7375717 they issued the warning for more funnel clouds and possible short lived tornadoes
7375718 trained weather spotters saw funnel clouds we do not have confirmed tornadoes however
7375719 the great artesian basin supports life right across central and north west queensland so we have to be careful how we use that particular resource
7375720 i think the changes we will make will be management issues that people suggest to us
7375721 weve had a meeting with the fire chief weve actually filled water trucks up and parked them at his house
7375722 theres not so much a bushfire risk but more for peoples safety
7375723 logical positivists and not just popper are supposed to have labeled
7375724 around the same time lamarck is supposed to have held that
7375725 they in a sense are stuck because they have no option to leave or move
7375726 there hasnt been a protest in the styx or florentine valleys for 17 days in fact a few weeks
7375727 now the reason theres a protest there now is that the olympics is finished and theres some media time free for them
7375728 29 4 7 an amazing prophetic truth has been fulfilled and the once mighty empires of assyria persia greece and rome have faded away
7375729 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place

7375741 if in the divine community father son and holy spirit there is no above and below superior and inferior but only the free society of equals who are different from each other but live together in mutual openness respect and self giving love so it is in a truly human society of people who are sexually politically and religiously different from each other
7375742 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7375743 the science according to many can only identify a strain of anthrax if they can identify it why didnt they act within the last three years to arrest ivins
7375744 after nearly seven years of investigation we have developed a body of powerful evidence that allows us to conclude that we have identified the origin and the perpetrator of the 2001 bacillus anthracis mailings
7375745 this was science at the very highest level the most precision we learned a great deal from the investigators
7375746 we always knew that someone was looking over our shoulders and would want to see our lab notebooks someday
7375747 we look at the deal as historic at least for youtube

7375751 the goal of morpheme has always been to streamline the animation production pipeline offering faster development times and higher fidelity
7375752 we selected nvidias physx technology because out of all commercial physics engines it offers the highest character grade fidelity an essential requirement for creating believable characters
7375753 naturalmotions technology marks a turning point in gaming its fidelity of movement makes characters seem so real that you want to touch them and the physx integration lets you do just that

7375760 we were in the desert carrying on the obama message

7375777 i want to control what other people do with their bodies
7375778 for some strange reason none of our intended audiences seem eager to read scholarly law review articles whats more there is something perverse about explaining an essentially visual and frequently surreal reality in gray lawyerly prose finally what could better illustrate the process we describe than a work which ahs to feature literally hundreds of copyrighted works in order to tell its story a living exercise in fair use hence this book

7375788 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7375789 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7375790 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7 300 a year
7375791 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7375792 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7375793 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7375794 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7375795 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7375796 its just unfortunate i guess that this sort of momentous occasion i guess should happen on the same day that our colleague is to have his memorial service
7375797 i guess the joy i suppose is tempered a little bit by the fact that were all very very deeply feeling for ben
7375798 whether there is any omen in it or whatever that should happen on the same day as his memorial service i know thats what ben would want for everything to be getting on and happening again
7375799 just then the mothers head pops up she was there all the time
7375800 only this kind of delusional person could commit such crimes
7375801 it might behoove some foundation to create a fellowship for enthusiasts of urban reform to spend a year on the south side in order to get a taste of what its actually like to live in the inner city before pontificating about policy
7375802 micahs post to this blog is incorrect because he is not very good looking
7375803 barron is unqualified to comment on this decision because he doesnt know the geographic location discussed

7375805 boston property taxes up 58 percent since 2002 and the citys cost of doing business rising the proposal is finding support from people who say money should be raised from those who use city services tow trucks ambulances etc but dont pay for them
7375806 for the price of driving on our roads and because you have caused a traffic snarl and are not from around here your ride will cost 300 more than a native bostonian
7375807 well i used be from around here in fact i lived in boston for 12 years while you were building this mess i suffered through the detours and closed roads and only moved away a couple of years ago and i did that because the schools were only getting worse and my kid was about to start kindergarten
7375808 olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles
7375809 somehow we are doing the same thing in a different way to know each other to listen to share to grow and pass the torch of knowledge throughout nations let us enjoy the olympics and pass on the friendship and peace with our hearts and souls

7375815 i dont think its right that the pictures of the driver and the license plate are shipped off to a contractor who decides whether this stands out as a violation
7375816 the benefit of being pulled over by a trooper if there is any benefit is that there is a law enforcement person who is saying that you sped
7375817 i will tell you that the court has no discretion in setting the amounts of fines and i am required by law to impose them in full

7375836 the travers is certainly the second most prestigious 3 year old race next to the kentucky derby
7375837 when youve been around horses for a long time the really good ones do things very differently than the usual ones this one from day 1 has shown that he never did anything to disappoint me it was an unfortunate thing in kentucky
7375838 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
7375839 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
7375840 the bullpen has pitched awfully well now we can use sampson along with hawkins in the late innings
7375841 terrific win team effort everybody contributed we played them all and they all contributed
7375842 all our extra men played and lots of them helped out
7375843 weve played good baseball we just havent got the offense on track in the last couple of days theyve done a good job against us
7375844 their pen shut us down and we kind of gave it up in our pen
7375845 its a tough deal because youd like to see him attack
7375846 theres also a plan in place and he didnt execute
7375847 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7375848 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7375849 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7375850 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7375851 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7375852 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7375853 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7375854 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7375855 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7375856 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7375857 thats what we shoot for two out of three and move on to the next one
7375858 he goes out and you know youre going to get a quality start
7375859 to go 4 2 and get three games ahead of second place los angeles is a good thing
7375860 i gave one up early but the early runs put a little less stress on you
7375861 we came out swinging today and i started putting pressure on them
7375862 first rule of taekwondo you cannot kick the referee in the head
7375863 underperformed the likes of which we have never seen from a u s track and field team
7375864 you know im not a crying sort but im sitting here at my computer crying
7375865 i think its too hot and the humidity is horrible
7375866 i went running this morning and it was a miserable run because it was too hot and too humid my run sucked
7375867 holy sh its hot out good god holy sh i need to rethink sundays
7375868 yeah i thought you were home i could smell you the house smells different now
7375869 our job is to be the voice for what the majority of the community wants
7375870 when there arent identifiable pieces sometimes we dont know right away what was working and what wasnt working
7375871 everybodys having a hard time its hard to put into words how devastating this is
7375872 series this oh so sweet baby sits on the caboose with its bottle
7375873 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
7375874 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
7375875 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7375876 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7375877 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
7375878 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7375879 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state
7375880 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7375881 going through the crisis there are two advisers ive paid no attention to
7375882 the first are the lawyers and the second are the accountants its not about the money or the legal liability this is about our being accountable for providing consumers with safe food
7375883 its highly likely that the hospital meat was related to the death
7375884 in todays commercial society its not the medal itself that makes an athlete a hero but the mass media
7375885 and its becoming more and more important for chinese athletes that they should learn to manage their image to learn how to deal with the media they should know that theyre becoming commercial brands
7375886 i think this time womens beach volleyball and womens tennis players may become new idols because people love to watch them but weight lifting and judo players may not get the same attention
7375887 i hope that through this match we can promote the development of this sport in china
7375888 now andriy will certainly be very motivated and he will have the desire to demonstrate that he is not that which we have seen in london and that he is a true footballer
7375889 i am happy to be able to embrace sheva once again
7375890 for us footballers it is not nice to not find yourself in form now andriy can return to form with us
7375891 we knew we needed to fight back after the loss to internacional
7375892 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7375893 we have a big game on wednesday night and we have to respond with a top class performance because was we did today saturday was just not good enough
7375894 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7375895 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7375896 without doubt its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us
7375897 he continues with the team because we are going to see what happens we need to think that he could also remain with the team this season
7375898 his declarations have been inopportune but nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will
7375899 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job there are always concerns when you see incidents like this they stabilised him and got him off the pitch
7375900 they did all the correct things and by all accounts he was lucid in the tunnel
7375901 i do not think there is any concern regarding a neck injury it is more he has a bang on his head
7375902 he will be observed for the next couple of hours and he may be allowed to go home providing he has some support there
7375903 it is always nice to play well in front of the owner of the club it does help
7375904 i spoke to him earlier in the week and i was really excited by what he had to say i am sure he enjoyed the game today
7375905 this was a big win for us irrespective of west ham going down to 10 men so early i felt we were in control
7375906 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7375907 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7375908 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7375909 given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with 10 men
7375910 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important
7375911 well go there to wrap up qualification to the group stage aware that well have to put in the same determination we put in during the first leg in turin
7375912 well be faced with opposition who dearly want to put on a good show in front of their fans
7375913 i paused for a second because i wasnt sure it had gone in once i realized it did the adrenalin kicked in a bit
7375914 we had a bit of a laugh earlier in the day talking about goal celebrations and watching the olympics so there was a bit of inspiration from beijing there
7375915 im happy to be out there and be a part of the team
7375916 i had a lot less nerves going into this match
7375917 my mental focus for the two games was a lot different there were a lot of nerves that i wasnt aware of until i had this week to compare to
7375918 im definitely looking forward to next week and looking forward to a hard week at training
7375919 if i can play some part against perth i will be stoked
7375920 theyre being very cooperative with us and they want to be in compliance
7375921 theres a bag of onions sitting on the floor and the floor is filthy
7375922 they are very tough people we do what we can
7375923 thats my biggest concern if a propane can went off it would level this shopping center
7375924 we set this up late friday afternoon hoping that they wouldnt get the word
7375925 the electoral map is due for some changes after a remarkably static red and blue divide
7375926 it is highly likely that a half dozen or more states will flip sides in 2008
7375927 there are a lot of people who are not from here and dont have the political and partisan allegiances of the folks who have lived here for years
7375928 michigan is in play for republicans because mccain is genuinely popular here
7375929 its the kind of state where he does well with sizable suburban areas with moderate republicans
7375930 these voters are not well grounded in any particular partisan allegiance
7375931 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
7375932 we are going to change the constitution and say on november 4 judges you cant touch this
7375933 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds
7375934 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
7375935 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
7375936 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok
7375937 the governor had an obligation to raise funds for the convention and the financial obligation is tremendous
7375938 this is about civic pride for the state of colorado from our unions perspective we are supporting the democratic candidate and party and it needs to have the money to run a good convention program you cant do it in a pup tent
7375939 its not some secretive soft money slush fund because its really going to a convention
7375940 we are feeling very strong and we dont trust anybody especially the united states
7375941 i mean who are these nations russia is probably stronger than any country in the g 8 except for the united states and it has more credibility because it hasnt killed hundreds of thousands of people recently
7375942 it has won wars and the other countries are losing them
7375943 as far as the russian elite is concerned its another very important step in russias restoration of its position in the world
7375944 the public and government is so proud not only because they defeated georgia but because they humiliated and defeated their great geopolitical rival the united states of america
7375945 moscow is very much concerned with the meddling of the united states in the post soviet space
7375946 we have been watching for a long time how the united states under the guise of helping new democracies has in fact been gaining managerial control over these countries
7375947 you still see the same effort in his delivery but now it ends up selling the off speed pitches
7375948 but if this guy loses his fastball and hitters can eliminate that pitch he doesnt have the command to get away with it
7375949 when you look at the best closers that doesnt happen
7375950 theres no question in my mind when i saw him he was 94 95 the biggest difference is his changeup which is one of the best in baseball it really drops and some guys think its a split but its not he has amazing arm speed
7375951 the people here were so great so unbelievable said lynx forward seimone augustus who won a gold medal as part of the u
7375952 they took such good care of everyone anything you needed they were right there they really made this a great experience
7375953 the olympic games open countries up they dont close countries china is an enormous player on the world scene and this country will be better for hosting the olympics
7375954 you are unlikely to see a games of this stature ever again
7375955 these have been a supremely well delivered games the detailed planning and execution has inspired us
7375956 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world rogge said
7375957 we were just listening to each other smiling on the phone
7375958 on the one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and my heart aches for my wife and family and for the loss on the other hand im extremely proud of and happy for my team and the usa volleyball organization for the things weve been able to achieve those are the two emotions i have and theyre conflicted obviously but i cannot change whats happened i can just embrace whats occurred and try to deal with it accordingly
7375959 this is extremely emotional for so many reasons weve all invested our lives in this sport and to hear our anthem played thats something you think about when youre 12 years old
7375960 this win doesnt bring back todd but they invested their lives in this too and i know theyre happy our prayers will continue to be with their family we know this is a bittersweet time were just happy to come out on top
7375961 from the first set everybody believed in it said u
7375962 we were making incredible plays its like the story came true it happened this is how it should end
7375963 but i am sorry for what happened with your team that is life family that is more important than the match
7375964 there is a lot of work to do a lot of grieving to come
7375965 ill look on this gold medal with a lot of satisfaction
7375966 if the opening theaters are packed for the films first two weeks it will get a national distribution turning on a new generation to the joy fun and power of the seattle spirit
7375967 vista has great new features new user interface yada yada yada
7375968 windows vista because xp is old not that theres anything wrong with that
7375969 windows vista performance its not a lie if you believe

7375975 if youre a little bit critical of barack obama you get really a pie of vilification right in the face
7375976 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7375977 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7375978 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7375979 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7375980 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7375981 were going to be going to the convention this week and if youre paying attention youll have a sense of who i am
7375982 my wife michelle speaks tomorrow night and youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care we had to figure out you know how to start a college fund for their kids
7375983 when you dont know how many homes you have and you define being wealthy as having 5 million then what that tells me is that you just dont get whats going on with peoples everyday lives the folks who are making 20 000 a year or 40 000 a year or 60 000 a year that are trying to get their kid into college or trying to pay their health care premiums at the end of every month
7375984 thats who im fighting for thats what built america that middle class this election is about you
7375985 we had a great day yesterday when i had the honor of introducing my selection as running mate the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the us joe biden
7375986 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
7375987 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
7375988 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humour in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
7375989 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humour
7375990 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
7375991 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7375992 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7375993 you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention than they get
7375994 not just the plasticised beauty you see on television there is also such a thing as a chaste ideal which comes from the heart and the soul and has a beneficial effect on those who come into contact with it
7375995 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelising spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvellous tool for spreading the christian message unfortunately some people still have a closed mentality
7375996 the real spelling problems occur when people have learnt the rules or have a bit of knowledge but then make mistakes in how they apply this
7375997 letters to a bullied girl messages of healing and hope
7375998 please love yourself in the same way your family loves you as you go through life you will realize that there are a lot more of us holding you up than them putting you down
7375999 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7376000 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7376001 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7376002 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7376003 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7376004 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7376005 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7376006 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7376007 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7376008 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7376009 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7376010 when the plane caught fire one of its doors was blocked and everyone rushed to another door
7376011 there was a stampede and many of those on board will only be able to be identified using dna analysis
7376012 the problem is simple muslim extremists often conflate israel and the diaspora they do this for two reasons one they are anti semites and so tend to see all jews and not merely zionists as their enemies the second is a practical one it is easy to strike at soft jewish targets outside of israel easier certainly than executing mass terror attacks against israeli targets these days and so what you have on occasion is an attack like the one directed against the jewish center in argentina in 1994 in which eighty five people were murdered
7376013 i think the best thing i have gained through this experience is confidence
7376014 its really hard for me to approach people doing this has given me a lot of confidence to just go in there be professional and do what i have to do
7376015 what i am actually doing is not the highlight of my trip
7376016 im really happy to get to observe everything in the main press center
7376017 and its been amazing the access that i have had to the olympics the magnitude of everything here is amazing
7376018 the chinese dont have the same concept of personal space as americans
7376019 theyre not trying to be rude its just their culture
7376020 they are very giving and kind people they go completely out of their way to help you
7376021 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7376022 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7376023 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7376024 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7376025 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7376026 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7376027 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7376028 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7376029 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7376030 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7376031 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7376032 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7376033 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7376034 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7376035 with the dnc being a national event you better believe intelligence operations will be in full swing
7376036 theres a legitimate question of how do we provide the public confidence that their rights wont be violated and that any intelligence gathering done is not only legal but justifiable
7376037 knowing how sensitive first amendment rights are we as a city want to make clear our respect for the constitution and will only conduct legitimate criminal investigations
7376038 of course its good to have policy that says a group should not be investigated solely for the views it may express
7376039 think the press loves biden and so the press will sort of go easy on him on the past gaffes and when hes contradicted obama
7376040 no i dont believe that thats made up this has nothing to do with black people
7376041 i dont want a f king abortion clinic in my neighborhood
7376042 we are feeling very strong and we dont trust anybody especially the united states
7376043 i mean who are these nations russia is probably stronger than any country in the g 8 except for the united states and it has more credibility because it hasnt killed hundreds of thousands of people recently
7376044 it has won wars and the other countries are losing them
7376045 as far as the russian elite is concerned its another very important step in russias restoration of its position in the world
7376046 the public and government is so proud not only because they defeated georgia but because they humiliated and defeated their great geopolitical rival the united states of america
7376047 moscow is very much concerned with the meddling of the united states in the post soviet space
7376048 we have been watching for a long time how the united states under the guise of helping new democracies has in fact been gaining managerial control over these countries
7376049 look i dont want to jinx him or anything because hes playing at such a high level but people have to understand sometimes preseason is all about mistakes
7376050 you dont get that many plays usually everybody is tired from camp and there isnt a whole lot of game planning to get people free the way you want
7376051 so its rare just very rare its not something you see a lot in the situations youre in during the preseason thats for sure im really excited about the way hes playing i think we all are
7376052 thats kind of the biggest thing not turning the ball over sometimes youre going to get tipped passes and things like that but im happy with that thats kind of the goal
7376053 and heres the thing i think people can recognize how well hes playing but you have to see the guys in front of him theyre doing a tremendous job giving him time to throw and guys are making plays when the balls in the air
7376054 but i think everybodys got the feeling when they look at him in the huddle that were going to be able to move the ball
7376055 you have a guy hes like john elway that way who doesnt worry about his percentages all the time his stats who believes he can do it wants to do it and has the arm strength to do it so you work to use the whole field and see the opportunities that will come because of that
7376056 i dont know ive never been a big fumbler in the pocket or anything like that
7376057 i didnt feel like i looked at that more than anything else in the offseason you just work to limit mistakes and find the matchups i dont want to make mistakes i want us to move the ball put up some points and get some wins thats always the bottom line
7376058 everybody knows if youre the quarterback you cant turn the ball over if you do youre not going to be the quarterback
7376059 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7376060 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7376061 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7376062 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7376063 these 200 it takes israel one week to ten days to re arrest them
7376064 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
7376065 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7376066 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7376067 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7376068 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7376069 political opponents would file frivolous complaints against web sites in order to try and shut them down
7376070 and that the republican convention is falling around 9 11 i have been waiting for that catch phrase to get started doesnt their repugnican spectacle end at least an entire week before that scary date
7376071 i worked very closely with him and was schooled very carefully by him
7376072 he was such a great guy to play with and to be coached by that it was an easy transition in a sense it was a little different than what theyre going through now
7376073 bart for the most part was at the end of his career and all the packer fans knew it and knew that a transition was coming so i dont think it was as difficult as the situation with brett favre and aaron rodgers
7376074 i wasnt an option quarterback or the kind of guy that was going to scramble around like fran tarkenton
7376075 i was more the bart starr type operator if you will that was going to back up in the pocket read the coverages and throw to the right guy so bart was the kind of guy i admired and emulated
7376076 plus id see bart in the off season when i was at alabama youd go to a banquet in birmingham and hed be there and id have a chance to talk with him
7376077 it wasnt like i hadnt played in an environment where there were some great legacy type quarterbacks
7376078 scotts a bright man and he has a good mind
7376079 coach devine offered me a big contract and a nice bonus to come to camp and i called coach bryant down in tuscaloosa to ask him what i should do
7376080 of course his answer was where are the offensive linemen scott
7376081 people were expecting so much from us last season and i think that kind of went to guys heads
7376082 now they dont expect anything from us i always liked being the underdog i hope people think were the worst team in the nation and talk bad about us every week
7376083 i can see the outside view that there is lots of inexperience
7376084 what people have overlooked is i have never seen a group of guys work harder since i have been at ucla we need to grow up and the only way to do that is by playing i feel there will be a dramatic change in every series we play from the first game and every game after that
7376085 he looks you right in the eye and tells you if he made a mistake i like that in guys
7376086 i dont know what outside expectations are nor do i care
7376087 i love it when people trash us it drives us
7376088 ive seen teams rise to levels that maybe individually you couldnt imagine
7376089 i played on a team that went to the rose bowl are starting 0 3 1 in 1983 expectations are low outside looking in not inside those are always high and we have to try to hold each other to them
7376090 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7376091 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7376092 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7376093 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake
7376094 the mexican sports system does not produce high performance athletes and today once again its in crisis
7376095 the problem basically is the insufficient way that our sports authorities identify prepare and support our athletes
7376096 we urgently need new people qualified with experience and above all honest and transparent
7376097 i am super happy with the results i have been getting
7376098 i am still young and i want to continue for me and for mexico
7376099 im very happy that my country had confidence in me
7376100 i carried my countrys flag i won the first medal for mexico we were the first women to win a medal for mexico in diving
7376101 for me it was a really good experience this simply inspired me and gave me the will to keep training because i feel like im close
7376102 this is a dream come true and ive worked hard for a long time for it
7376103 when the plane caught fire one of its doors was blocked and everyone rushed to another door
7376104 there was a stampede and many of those on board will only be able to be identified using dna analysis
7376105 id never seen it on tape or heard any of the commentary for me that against chela was the best game that ive ever played for sure ill show some friends and stuff if i want to show off a little bit
7376106 i just think for me this is my best surface
7376107 ive said it all along i think i play my best tennis here i feel most comfortable on the courts and my results have shown that ive always played well in america so yeah i think this is my best chance for winning a slam
7376108 i love new york as a city when i missed wimbledon last year i realised how much it meant to me so i always want to play great at wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality and stuff i think the us open and new york suits me better
7376109 theres definitely tougher draws out there but youve got to make sure that youre switched on from the start of the slams
7376110 its not so much that youre worried about losing the match but you dont want to have any dips early at the start of the match you want to come through as quickly as possible and not have too many long matches at the start of the tournament
7376111 i dont think you really know whether you are ready or not i just think you do all the things that are going to give you the best shot at doing it and when the opportunity comes you either take it or you dont
7376112 id like to think that i can take it when the opportunity comes but you know ive never been past the quarters before so whether im ready or not i dont know
7376113 sometimes in a big tournament you need a bit of luck i dont think im ready to just breeze through a slam like a federer or a nadal and there will be tough matches along the way but sometimes the seeds go out early and there are some upsets and you just have to make the most of it
7376114 ive never been north but im at chelsea for two seasons so i must get used to bolton manchester united manchester city
7376115 what i expected i saw today it was difficult winning 1 0 away from home in england is the same as winning 10 0 elsewhere wigan played better than portsmouth and had players who are healthy have power and pressured us i know we didnt play as well as we did last week but i understand the reasons why
7376116 it didnt matter who took them they kept doing the same frigging thing
7376117 theyve had a bad day but the piece of brilliance in the game came from deco if it wasnt him it might have been from nicolas anelka if not him joe cole florent malouda theyve got a string of talent and how do you compete to think that we used to mock rangers and celtic being so dominant in scotland didnt we
7376118 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7376119 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7376120 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7376121 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7376122 because soca artists are viewed as a subculture we look for help from people who have made it in the mainstream
7376123 soca has great potential so i asked lil jon and pitbull to help us and they have responded enthusiastically

7376132 the situation i was in and the pressure i was under was enormous
7376133 if you have a family like mine a large tribe they all want to impose their opinion on you i am the eldest son so it was very difficult for me to do what i wanted to do father mother and brothers come first for us and we experienced a lot of difficulties in iraq over the years wars we had to move house and i was without work for a while

7376142 hes talented enough that hes going to be a top division i player
7376143 hes only going to grow a little bit and get stronger so with the right work ethic hes fine
7376144 some of these kids have to leave their options open

7376150 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7376151 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7376152 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7376153 these 200 it takes israel one week to ten days to re arrest them
7376154 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can

7376170 thats an extremely disturbing example of dhs conducting a shoddy investigation where the investigator failed to interview key witnesses and misstated the information of other witnesses
7376171 for dhs to handle the case the way they did is a travesty of justice
7376172 verbal interactions with children that included name calling shaming making derogatory remarks and using language that threatened humiliated or frightened children
7376173 she would yank a child across the room by their arm ive seen her take children out of the classroom and have them come back with red marks on their arms i had a child wet themselves because they were so afraid of her
7376174 i saw mrs gupta on numerous occasions be verbally abusive and terrorize children theyd be crying sometimes shaking it was extremely hard to watch
7376175 i have spent so much time in that school over 11 years but have never seen any of the children mishandled
7376176 of course its common sense its nothing bad to say its to get children to think
7376177 because some people are strict it means they are abusive thats bull
7376178 the impending global water crisis geology soils agronomy and international security
7376179 the life of the party people were just drawn to him

7376181 weve been asking and asking the county for a warning light maybe now theyll put one it but its shame someone has to die to get things done

7376199 i want everyone to know that though i asked for 600 million in cuts speaker silver along with his staff brought up 850 million in cuts that could have taken us further than we were and the only thing that stood between us and those reductions was the new york state senate
7376200 next year we dont want to have this problem again so we wish you well and we hope that when we see him later in the year well call him the majority leader and we will lead this state back from its fiscal difficulty
7376201 i saw that the assembly got ridiculed in a few places and the speaker has a primary and i wanted to point out that he gets this
7376202 im not running the show because i have to work with whoever wins
7376203 and so malcolm smith has been most gracious whenever weve discussed this we both understand this his job is to go out and win the majority as a democrat when i can be helpful i will be im not going to be the major player in this because as i said i have to work with whoever wins in november

7376221 organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models
7376222 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilized with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognize that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
7376223 it feels like a lot of hard work finally came together
7376224 i feel vindicated now i stayed tough and today i got the job done
7376225 for some reason i got fired up after the 12th
7376226 i wish i could have put a little pressure on him coe but i never really got into birdie position i left myself a lot of 25 and 30 foot putts
7376227 una de las cosas que yo he criticado mucho es que se opina sin que haya terminado el proceso judicial esto de linchar a la persona antes de que empiece el juicio no es saludable para el sistema democr tico es la ant tesis de la democracia
7376228 la presunci n de inocencia en la constituci n no est por mera apariencia es de las garant as m s importantes que tiene cada persona
7376229 hoy d a en la pol tica el adversario no siempre es de afuera sino del propio partido
7376230 el tribunal resolvi que el discrimen pol tico existe no s lo de partidos contrarios sino dentro de la misma ideolog a
7376231 en la pol tica se demuestran los peores rasgos del ser humano la envidia los celos pol ticos la absoluta compulsi n a querer prevalecer destruyendo a los dem s no a prevalecer por propios m ritos
7376232 lo nico que procede ahora es que siga el curso del caso y que de castro font tenga todas las garant as necesarias
7376233 all i could hear were screams and shouts people thought that i was injured because i was covered with blood but it wasnt from my injuries it was of others only god saved me

7376241 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7376242 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7376243 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7376244 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7376245 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7376246 i think the best thing i have gained through this experience is confidence
7376247 its really hard for me to approach people doing this has given me a lot of confidence to just go in there be professional and do what i have to do
7376248 what i am actually doing is not the highlight of my trip
7376249 im really happy to get to observe everything in the main press center
7376250 and its been amazing the access that i have had to the olympics the magnitude of everything here is amazing
7376251 the chinese dont have the same concept of personal space as americans
7376252 theyre not trying to be rude its just their culture
7376253 they are very giving and kind people they go completely out of their way to help you
7376254 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7376255 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7376256 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7376257 we believe the visit will be a turning point in the two countries relationship which has been primarily an economic one to expand into all areas including politics defense and culture
7376258 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi al qaeda in iraq network
7376259 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7376260 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7376261 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7376262 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years

7376272 investigative reporters are the perfect hero in the movies because they really are surrogates for the moviegoer
7376273 they ask the questions the moviegoer wants to know about they get the information the moviegoer wants to find out they give you great narrative they give you great exposition theyre the perfect movie hero and thats why i think weve had so many films featuring investigative reporters
7376274 la asamblea es la soberana es la que manda hicimos una recomendaci n a base del informe pol tico pero la decisi n de la asamblea es que no se deb an cerrar todas la puertas de negociaci n con el pip y el partido popular

7376278 i have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged their feathers are just too bright and when they fly away the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice still the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone i guess i just miss my friend
7376279 a heartening recognition that time in washington can be useful

7376283 were here to tell the other side of the story and set the record straight
7376284 were going to be sprinting to the finish those final 60 days
7376285 i think youve got two conventions going on here in denver and typically when parties are split the other party wins
7376286 a heartening recognition that time in washington can be useful
7376287 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7376288 used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
7376289 the footage aired by the british tv channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town gori written in georgian and english languages the report also said that a sky news correspondent was reporting from the georgian town
7376290 the need for respect for the archaeological historical cultural and religious heritage of iraq and for the continued protection of archaeological historical cultural and religious sites museums libraries and monuments
7376291 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7376292 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing
7376293 the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity
7376294 youd have to go back centuries to the mongol invasion of baghdad in 1258 to find looting on this scale
7376295 i thought i was given assurances that sites and museums would be protected
7376296 persuading the pentagon to relax legislation that protects iraqs heritage by prevention of sales abroad
7376297 merit securing as soon as possible to prevent further damage destruction and or pilferage of records and assets
7376298 coalition forces must secure these facilities in order to prevent looting and the resulting irreparable loss of cultural treasures
7376299 our troops who have been proudly guarding the oil ministry where no window is broken deliberately condoned these horrendous events

7376307 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7376308 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7376309 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7376310 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7376311 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7376312 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7376321 everyone knows at my position that scholarships are tight on the d1 level so that was not the time to go tearing my acl laugh
7376322 i just decided to go to ole miss and arkansas camps i went on unofficial visits to tulsa and vandy too but i had been going to the arkansas camps since coach nutt was there and then he left to ole miss so i decided to go over there
7376323 he kept my name in their ear while i was hurt they invited me down to jr day so i went down there in march it was the first time i had seen the campus i was use to arkansas so i did not know what to expect but when i got down there i saw how much nicer it was than arkansas and the facilities were just as nice i did not expect that that got me real interested in ole miss then i talked to coach shibest at jr day and i got to know him and coach jay jones a lot better and i really liked them
7376324 coach shibest wanted me to come back down there for their sr camp to evaluate me they said they were looking to sign one punter and one kicker in their class so i headed down there the 6 3
7376325 coaches shibest ealy and jones went out there and they watched me punt they were impressed i guess they talked to coach nutt before i went into his office coach nutt promised me a scholarship even though he said they did not have one open right then
7376326 they called my coach and he told me on august 13th that i had a scholarship i went to arkansas camp the week before but they said they wanted to see me punt my senior season before making a final call ole miss jumped on me i knew they had confidence in me so i went ahead and committed to them i called coach shibest and then i called coach nutt to let him know he said i just solved a big headache for him coach nutt was glad to hear the news
7376327 i usually kick it so long i outkick my coverage coach shibest wants me to get the ball up higher on my foot so the coverage guys can get down there
7376328 the o line coach mike markuson was 75 yards away and i hit him in the back in the air
7376329 i was at the goal line and he was on the 25 yard line on the other side of the field
7376330 this off season i kicked one that rolled 107 yards
7376331 i was underneath the goal post and it rolled into the other end zone
7376332 luczo dragon racing is excited to add another race to its 2008 season with symantec we believe the detroit grand prix at belle isle is one of the great stops on the indycar series schedule tomas loves the track and this will give us more road experience as we continue to prepare for what we hope will be a full season in 2009
7376333 i am really looking forward to belle isle it is a very technical and quick track i love wall to wall driving and this track rewards drivers who are aggressive and willing to take a few risks
7376334 i went through turns 1 2 and 3 side by side with mike potekhen and i thought i had left enough room or if he came up on me but we touched wheels and i barreled over i feel ok just a little shaken
7376335 this is great this is a beautiful day im pretty happy and i love this track i won here in 2005 in star mazda so now ive repeated in 2008 i had an awesome car team moore racing gave me a beautiful car i did the job i finished first but its just not me its the team my family my manager this is for all the people who supported me in chile
7376336 we had something for pablo donoso its just every time you go into a braking zone all the air is off the cars and with it being so hot today and a bunch of different rubber on the track we were just locking up tires we had a few moments out there i fell back to pablo donoso but overall it was a good race it was a big improvement from where we started at the open test when we were about 11 th or 12 th so well take a fifth and a second from a weekend in california
7376337 it was a good race unfortunately during the restart i was a little bit stuck behind pablo donoso it was so hard to pass but when someone made a mistake you could pass and we got another podium its fantastic im really thankful for my healthy choice sam schmidt crew they worked really hard this weekend i dont know what happened behind us but i hope we can still fight for the championship
7376338 it was just tough to pass out there we were running on a little bit less aero than everyone else it was helping us stay up but it was making it so every time i got close id kind of lose the front end and wash back off as you can see weve got guys that were running faster lap times than us yesterday that couldnt get by so thats kind of unfortunate we could have really stood to finish ahead of bia ana beatriz just for the points but were looking pretty good going into chicago weve had good runs on the big tracks so i think we should be looking pretty good
7376339 yesterday was a good race it was a good opportunity to pick out the numbers for the inverted start but i picked the wrong number i think the way they do that is not very good its good for all the drivers especially at this track because theres not much passing so its a very boring race it was good that richard antinucci raphael matos and myself did some fighting out there the car was good again but you cannot overtake here i just tried to be close to them and i knew that i could have the opportunity to pass them and it happened after that i had just one lap and i was catching them the race leaders like crazy i think i was almost the fastest lap so i thought we could win again today for sure
7376340 i feel great thats what we needed coming out of here the inversion of the second race made things very very difficult i was clearly faster than richard antinucci unfortunately he blocked me four or five times he didnt give me any room and thats what happened im very happy that i made the pass and continue leading the championship and well go into chicago competing for the championship
7376341 all of the opposition is very difficult this year to pass everyone was stationary and were all having control gaps there was a dnf car in the middle of turn 8 and he was on line so we all got a little bunched up i chose my line from the beginning in the backstraight raphael matos went to the outside and cut the track so he came out right behind by cutting the track thats how he gained the advantage i chose the inside from the beginning knowing that he was right on my tail and i would get passed i cant bank on having the race review that later on so i defended my position from the inside and he choose the outside and then back inside and just lifted me in the air and pushed me off i lost two places im ok a little bruised but im ok
7376342 lucasfilm has been hooked up with agr for a while and now were doing this and its been a great relationship the new movie is an animated feature that is sort of a precursor to a tv series that is coming out in the fall it gets a lot of notoriety for the team especially with the stars wars brand and indiana jones we already have more notoriety than we need if were going to give it to something we might as well give it to racing ive lived through the andretti legends and now marco is carrying that on
7376343 the fraternity pulled together with us and helped us get back together all these guys they are all racers a great group of guys it is all about people and helio castroneves and ryan briscoe really did the job today we have tough competition out there helio wanted to get that win and wow what a way to do it under the adversity we had this week i want to thank everyone that called us and helped us over the last several days
7376344 once again it shows the determination that this group has it wasnt easy the way that yellow came out it was a bit of a mixed bag fortunately we were able to mix strategies and play it out from there we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to it is a testament to the organization we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7376345 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke that is the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7376346 its unbelievable to start the week off the way we did with the fire and everything and then dominate with a one two qualifying and race result its definitely the strongest weve been all year im so happy for helio castroneves not getting a win all year and getting all of those seconds was killing him so im really happy for him to win the race he was the quickest car out there today its just great for the team big congrats to team penske
7376347 the only thing i could do was risk we were going for the win i have to say what a boring race there was no passing saving fuel from lap 1 i did not have any fun im not taking it for granted but maybe we have to look at the fuel windows so we dont have people pitting on lap 5 we race for the fans and although they are crazy here today it was kind of boring
7376348 they gave me a number above the one i needed to make it and i was making it i was controlling well and on the last lap they said go and i did
7376349 we had a good pit strategy and we had picked it from the very beginning we decided we wanted to go two stops and we saved as much fuel as we could we knew it wasnt going to be easy and we would have to save a lot more fuel than most did but at the end of the day it worked out for us the car was the best i have had it all weekend i was definitely pretty happy with it it certainly gave me something to race with
7376350 im not upset with anybody in particular we just did absolutely nothing right i dont know why we stayed out when the car in front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up any track position everything we did was wrong
7376351 we still lost a ton of points this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick hopefully well turn it around next time
7376352 when you lose 30 whatever today it makes it a lot easier to come back
7376353 it was definitely a bad day i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7376354 well those things happen and we have to go into the next couple races i think if helio castroneves wins the next two we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7376355 i give chip ganassi a lot of credit he came into the team meeting today and hes got a lot of guests here from target and we wanted to perform well scotts dixon obviously in the championship hunt and he gave us the order that we were going to do something very alternative and we did and it just kind of played out perfectly it was a great job from him and everybody the pit stops were really good it was just one of those races there was a pretty clear track most of the time so it worked out
7376356 we didnt think like that we said that we were going to commit to it and whatever happens happens we started in the back it is so difficult trying to pass tony kanaan was really slow at the end but he was quick enough in the right places so it was hard to pass that was a shame it was a good day for target chip ganassi racing its unfortunate for scott dixon he was quick all weekend thats the thing with these tracks its hard to overtake hes one of the best guys out there i think its the strategy that cost him but hell bounce back and he knows hes got a strong teammate in his corner to look after him
7376357 i am very proud of the motorola team today kyle moyer and my crew did a great job we started in the ninth position and to get a top five finish at a course that is very difficult to pass at is great we need to use this momentum going into belle isle next week and hopefully have a repeat finish
7376358 what a great day for us ive got to thank everybody on the delphi national guard pit stand because it was jb team owner john barnes david cripps and the guys that really made this happen for us they took a risk early and it paid off for us at the end of the race i took one shot at passing e j viso but i was losing rear brakes badly and the back was skating around on me it was a great points day for us too especially after starting 18 th i think a few weeks ago we were in 16 th position in the championship and now were in 11th weve still got two more races and more positions to make up
7376359 the mcdonalds team was running strong but once that yellow happened it really mixed everything up and we had to decide which strategy to go on helio was on our same strategy and he won the race but he was able to get by people a couple of guys between me and him werent able to overtake the backmarkers and it allowed the people on the other strategy to capitalize its disappointing because i thought the mcdonalds car was good and we had a strong day but we couldnt get a result out of it we did everything we could so we just have to move on to the next one
7376360 people kept telling me that the door to victory lane would finally open and today we broke through it the door was really stuck but what an incredible effort by team penske i cant thank them enough im really excited about today because the car was extremely fast for me it was really fun pushing and pushing every lap for the entire race thats what its all about and thats what made us win we didnt save any fuel we just kept going and going and it paid off in the end
7376361 we didnt plan it like that but with the traffic we changed the plans lap by lap and we pitted when we thought we were going to slow down we never let our guard down we just kept pushing and we came away with a win
7376362 the attitude of those guys is priceless everyone has been working so hard since last wednesday taking cars to charlotte and bringing cars back from charlotte converting cars from oval to road course youre talking about two days work in 12 hours when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best not that we dont always give our best but you want to make it a special day and today it was
7376363 my hand was hurting a lot during the race it started maybe after 10 laps the pain was coming and going to steer left was really difficult but i just had to go to push we had a different strategy but so did a lot of other people then i got stuck behind a car as soon as he pitted i started to go one second faster but it was too late it was good to get experience and mileage but it would have been nice to get a better result
7376364 it was a tough race but it was good to put in laps and gain experience the car had some understeer but i did my best it was just so difficult to pass out there we tried to do a different strategy but so did everyone else
7376365 we had a good car and good pace today i think our strategy was good too so ive got to hand it to the guys they set us up for a good run in the moorefield construction car unfortunately we had two pit stops that were slower than usual and that put us back a bit at the end of the race i was fighting for position with mario moraes and justin wilson moraes made a mistake and justin and i were right on his tail and i hit justin and spun it was unfortunate because it sent us from 12 th to 17 th at the end i was happy to pass ryan hunter reay for 16 th he blocked me and when i got by him we actually touched just a bit and i got a puncture in my tire so i was lucky to make it across the line in that position our result is not an indication of our speed or our effort so that is disappointing but i am so proud of team owner tyler tadevic and this crew for hanging in there in what has been a tough season this team is some of the hardest working most dedicated group ive ever met
7376366 we settled into a pace there we made some changes throughout the race unfortunately it didnt quite work out for us we picked up some understeer and then after about lap 30 we were just fighting the brakes the pedal was getting longer and longer as the brakes wore out the brake pedal was going over center and i just couldnt get it to bite on the brakes like i wanted which resulted in having super early braking points in both the hairpin corners with that our lap times were just getting hammered guys were crawling all over me so at that point i just had to drive as smart and smooth as possible and kind of take care of the brakes as much as i could i was just hanging on basically for the second half of the race which is frustrating you come here wanting to race put your head down and charge thats sometimes the way it goes im happy to bring the william rast car home in one piece and well focus on trying to improve for australia
7376367 today was a tough day for the formula dream team our strategy was to pit in the beginning of the race assuming that all other teams will pit later than us and to move up while theres less traffic however it didnt work out the way we wanted since there were always other teams pitting on the same timing if strategy worked out well i think couldve finished in the top six but thats the race you never know if your strategy will work or not i hope i will be able to do better in the next race
7376368 we were right where we needed to be when we got punted by justin wilson the race went downhill from there pretty quickly not sure what happened there but it was a pretty dirty move from where i was it was a pretty disappointing end to what had been a promising weekend
7376369 it was pretty rough for the no 2 lilly car from the start we had a hard time just getting off the grid with a clutch or electronic issue with the clutch we wont be sure exactly what the problem was until the vision crew can get the car back to indy and take a look that made each pit stop that much more difficult but the crew did a good job each time there we were a couple of different strategies going but it was a lot about luck and who you got stuck behind it just didnt work out for us today but well hope for better in detroit
7376370 competition wise this was probably the best race weve had on a road course i was challenging people all the time so that was encouraging the vision team did a really good job putting me on a good strategy the problem happened on the last pit stop and the clutch wouldnt work and i stalled it twice trying to get back out the clutch wouldnt engage at all and we ended up losing a lot of time in the end i was being aggressive trying to get past townsend bell to get one more spot and points but i went off the track and spun in i tried to get back out but without the clutch working that was it for us it wasnt the finish we were looking for by any means but as far as our competitiveness in the race i think we are definitely going in the right direction and looking forward to seeing what we can do at detroit
7376371 today was a funny day we thought we had a better car than yesterday but as it turns out we didnt the car turned very loose very fast during the race we had the same problem at qualifying yesterday it was a drive shaft that got us in the end we have a lot of laps under our belt here now we need to walk away with a plan and prepare for next week at belle isle
7376372 i think we did a great job the car was very competitive and michael cannon gave us great strategy today to lead the race and be up front the team i have to give them a ton of credit also the pit stops were fast and helped us maintain our position we have some room to improve and run against the bigger teams but today proved that we can compete with them
7376373 this was a very disappointing race for kv racing technology the cars were fast all weekend but we got caught out by a caution flag at just the wrong time and could not make up the track position

7376375 parkinsons is a costly disease and places a huge burden on carers and society as a whole we need governments to realise that taking action to reduce this burden by ensuring people receive the best care and treatment available makes the most economic and social sense
7376376 there are nearly 1 2 million people living with parkinsons in europe and with an ageing population this figure is set to rise its time to address inequalities in care and treatment of the disease and improve the lives of those affected by parkinsons now and in the future
7376377 epdas campaign is a vital step in offering hope to the millions of people with parkinsons by increasing the visibility of the condition and inspiring action this is a terrible condition and we must heighten the publics awareness of it to ensure the fight for improved care and treatment continues throughout europe
7376378 i dont know you but when we leave here i am going to give you my number and my name and you are going to call me and i am going to be there with you every step of the way
7376379 its the latest in a series of pr moves designed to mislead the public from the fact that the government is asleep at the wheel here
7376380 any group that is opposed to a proven safe technology that enhances food safety is misguided
7376381 its a way to try to come in and clean up problems that are created in the middle of the food production chain i think its clearly a disincentive to clean up the problems at the source
7376382 hopefully therell be some manufacturers that will take that step
7376383 hopefully the public will be less concerned about it all the evidence suggests that theres not a risk
7376384 as far as the bush administration goes i think were seeing a whole raft of attempts to push through regulatory changes like this
7376385 ones theyre afraid they cant get passed under another president
7376386 google has drastically cut back their budget on the culinary program how is it affecting campus no more dinner no more tea trolley no more snack attack in the afternoon
7376387 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7376388 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7376389 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7376390 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7376391 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7376392 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7376393 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7376394 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7376395 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7376396 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7376397 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7376398 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7376399 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7376400 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7376401 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7376402 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7376403 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7376404 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7376405 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7376406 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7376407 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7376408 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376409 ten minutes before the crash the engine just stopped and then we coasted we tried to land in a field but we overshot
7376410 the people on the left side of the plane were ok because there was a big door
7376411 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376412 these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground
7376413 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
7376414 it is very likely that a burial ceremony would have been held at the tombs perhaps attended by many people we know that some families hired professional mourners who would weep and wail and add to the atmosphere of the burial
7376415 for the first time we are starting to understand the layout of the civilian settlement that provided services to the garrison of the fort and we can catch a glimpse of the roman way of life and death on the northern frontier of the empire
7376416 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376417 we feel reticent about making statements about the possible reopening of the two
7376418 the reactors will only be reconnected when the preconditions are met this is not the case in the foreseeable futures
7376419 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376420 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
7376421 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
7376422 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

7376427 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7376428 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7376429 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7376430 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7376431 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7376432 they skidded between 1 000 and 1 500 meters yards
7376433 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376434 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
7376435 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
7376436 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
7376437 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
7376438 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376439 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo un an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones
7376440 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7376441 es indudable que la capacidad militar del erg se disminuy de manera significativa por la ofensiva militar si no es as ellos no habr an recapacitado pero tambi n se les ofreci una negociaci n digna estamos interesados en enviar ese mensaje que el gobierno sabe tender la mano

7376443 surely we cannot be pleased with millions of terminated pregnancies blake said to applause from the nearly full wells fargo theater
7376444 schenck said the hall filled with several thousand democratic activists fell as blake spoke against abortion
7376445 but they refuse to recognize their responsibility and the responsibility of our nation to those who have been born
7376446 schenck said the hall filled with several thousand democratic activists fell uneasily silent
7376447 their eyes were shut and seeing for the first time
7376448 its about you and chris i knew it hes why you dont spend as much time with us as you used to
7376449 but there was too little time and too many obstacles to overcome
7376450 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7376451 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7376452 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7376453 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election

7376456 this discovery puts a tragic end to two weeks of anguish and despair they said
7376457 we wish to thank the people of victoria our family and friends in melbourne and mauritius the media auburn south primary school collingwood english language school and melbourne girls college for their assistance and prayers
7376458 last but not least we will be eternally grateful to the victorian police victorias finest men and women in uniform who did not leave any stones unturned in their quest in bringing yadav back to us
7376459 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7376460 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7376461 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7376463 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376464 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
7376465 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
7376466 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
7376467 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
7376468 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7376469 right now we have five emergency shelters activated and we have the potential to open 14 if necessary

7376478 our position remains open as far as new roads being tolled but we wont be tolling existing roads for general motorists use
7376479 but once theyve got their foot in the door theres no way known they wouldnt introduce it for other motorists
7376480 theyre pulling the wool over the communitys eyes theyre being deceptive and theyre trying to hide their true intentions which are to toll existing roads and introduce a congestion tax
7376481 ruling anything in nor ruling anything out among sir rods 20 key proposals
7376482 you can never say never but what sir rod eddington was saying was that it was 10 years plus down the track
7376483 have they embraced a congestion tax in the past yes they have park levies on long term car parks in melbourne
7376484 and have they tolled a private road before because eastlink was supposed to have no tolls and they turned around and tolled

7376492 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7376493 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7376494 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7376495 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in

7376507 you saw the team we put out for them to win anywhere in the premier league is a credit
7376508 i should be helping them by bringing in reinforcements to help them
7376509 is that affecting them of course it is they arent daft
7376510 four or five national governing bodies elsewhere in europe want to come and have a look at what were doing because they think weve had a really good games
7376511 my perception is that we havent done as well as we want to be or as we need to be doing
7376512 four medals are clearly not going to be enough in london i cant categorically promise but i am very confident we will do better ill bet my job on it
7376513 i have read the speculation about my future with interest
7376514 i havent heard anything on the subject from either my chief executive or my chairman
7376515 thats the length of time it takes to create what you might call a super programme
7376516 i know with 2012 round the corner we havent got long thats why im frustrated that we have wasted time in the area of sports development where we havent done enough this sport is a super tanker and i think weve turned it i think we are sailing into better water but weve just to keep the effort going
7376517 theres a lot more things that are right with the sport today than there were when i took over in 2005 we might have had two or three more medals here the disqualification in the mens sprint relay was down to human error but the womens sprint relay team were knocked out of their lane by the jamaicans when they were up on russia and they might possibly have won a gold
7376518 athletics would themselves agree that they have not delivered in the way that our most successful sports have
7376519 you can never take anything for granted in life never
7376520 i would like to think were one of cheapest clubs in the premier league and i think thats right for the area we live in i dont think well be the only club who get affected the credit crunch is there theres no doubt about it sometimes people think that football can just sail on regardless of whats happening in the world but its vulnerable to these things
7376521 there is a lot of pressure when you play for liverpool and i know what the headlines would have been if we had lost to middlesbrough
7376522 i have been here long enough to know what it is like so to reverse it and go top of the league shows what fine lines there are in football im sure there would have been a lot of criticism of players and the manager had we lost but we are top of the league and thats the difference
7376523 if we perform as we have done over the last few weeks its going to be extremely difficult to beat standard li ge theyre not a mickey mouse team
7376524 weve shown what we intend to do this season over the two weeks home and away thats how we will play
7376525 others will have to play to their strengths and with the pace in our side we felt we could come here and play as we did
7376526 i couldnt ask for more from the lads if wed have come off with a point we would have been disappointed and im heartbroken for them we have great belief in them and however disappointed they are now they should take a lot out of it
7376527 in kenya this year we had a problem about the election
7376528 now we have a good peace in kenya today i am very happy to be the winner from 1968 kenya could not get the gold medal in the marathon in 2008 it is history for my country in the marathon
7376529 all the doctors tell me natures a wonderful thing and that once i get back shell probably have it straight away
7376530 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7376531 we dont want a massive gap to open up between ourselves and the other teams who are going to be up there
7376532 the newcastle result was disappointing but that has gone were looking at portsmouth and then the super cup then weve got a two week break before facing liverpool away we want to make sure we go into that break with two wins under our belt
7376533 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out
7376534 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7376535 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half
7376536 when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality fulham started stronger and were sharper the corner showed that we were not sharp enough the mistake we made on the corner is not excusable
7376537 losing so early in the season puts extra pressure on us
7376538 but i also think it is the best warning that we can be given we cant think we are untouchable i hope we have learnt a lot of things during this defeat if we want to challenge we cannot afford to lose again we have to put more heart in keep focused and play our football
7376539 as soon as we dont play together as soon as we dont put our spirit together we can lose the game that was the case today so these are the things we have to put together once we do we have no reason to lose a game we have lost and now we have something to prove we have to show character and personality and get back our confidence
7376540 the manager has bought some cracking players and were looking like a good squad
7376541 the fulham who can play with composure pass well and be organised and the fulham who can defend with their backs to the wall
7376542 he nearly got killed he was very very lucky and hes still got the scars to show that
7376543 there were always issues about whether or not he would play for his country again but hes got over that hes such a lovely lad a real gem hes fine now
7376544 mama is powerful tall and strong and we do play a direct style here so if you play a diagonal ball into him he can flick it on in the box which is a strength of ours
7376545 wed have been delighted whoever got the goal as long as we won but when he got it there was a little smile on everyones faces because hes a gentleman off the pitch
7376546 theyre very dangerous but we thought we had resolved the problems of coping with them
7376547 we had one last long throw to deal with and whether it was a bit of luck or what the ball ended up in our net one thing in the last minute of a game is if you cant win it then at least dont lose it
7376548 you dont live in that neighborhood that is not your home
7376549 sometimes i feel discriminated against but it does not make me angry it merely astonishes me how can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company
7376550 you know its not the world that was my oppressor because what the world does to you if the world does it to you long enough and effectively enough you begin to do to yourself
7376551 and i know that i will have to come here to play bolton manchester united manchester city here in the north i understand that now
7376552 you always say that first placed team playing against the last is not easy
7376553 chelsea didnt look at any stage like they would rip us apart like they did with portsmouth
7376554 chelsea have had a bad day but a piece of brilliance from deco has saved them thats why they are at the highest level if it hadnt been him they have others who can do that
7376555 it doesnt mean that much to be top after just two games
7376556 but its good for the group to have six points
7376557 but when i am in the club i will discuss this its impossible before an important game with so many problems
7376558 i suspect its a subtle way it clearly cant be seen to be taking sides
7376559 i thought to myself what am i doing but then you come back and say lets do your job and i found the old lady and lifted her out
7376560 theyll climb up anywhere using pipes wheelie bins whatever they can grab on to like spiderman
7376561 ive come in at 3am and seen them and said what are you doing and they say trying to play ninjas
7376562 mccain white house will reflect the guiding principles of theodore roosevelt
7376563 he cites as an example of congressional excess and frivolity
7376564 its very serious to have your core system go down
7376565 the core system is the system of record the absolute arbiter of how much money you have and how much money you deposited today
7376566 this is a banks worst nightmare to have the core banking system goes down
7376567 that means any channel you go to theyre running blind
7376568 return full system functionality to you as soon as possible

7376571 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7376572 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days we will cherish forever
7376573 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7376574 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7376575 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7376576 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7376577 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7376578 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7376579 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7376580 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7376581 you look at in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7376582 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7376583 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7376584 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7376585 westchester was a this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7376586 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7376587 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7376588 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7376589 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7376590 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7376591 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7376592 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7376593 the wondergirls are trying to get their sexy back but they never had it in the first place
7376594 nenhum poder terias contra mim se do c u n o te fosse dado
7376595 all this stuff terry has been getting at home all this bullshit is not nice
7376596 its hard to say no to a million pounds but if they come to me with a sensible offer and terry is ok well that could be me signing for four years and going into the next olympics i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and i could earn some decent dough winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city imagine that and to be the face of the london olympics would be unbelievable deep in my heart i think london 2012 thats me if terry stays thats me i think he could keep four or five of us from the beijing team
7376597 i had just been thinking let me just get through this
7376598 it was hard tonight but everything proved worthwhile he was holding me throwing me it was horrible then his little gold teeth were munching me up but i kept thinking i want this and im going to get it
7376599 when i said i dont need this and that maybe i should spend more time at home which is something my wife deserves but the way i feel now having seen the team exceed its targets and with a record of three olympic finals in three olympics and two gold medals i do have this urge to carry on with this team we can a have real impact on the next olympics we could be the new cuba of amateur boxing
7376600 you saw the team we put out for them to win anywhere in the premier league is a credit
7376601 i should be helping them by bringing in reinforcements to help them
7376602 is that affecting them of course it is they arent daft
7376603 investigators close to the shelby county murders of five mexican males was carried out by mexican drug gangs or their surrogates and is very likely related to drugs and cash
7376604 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7376605 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7376606 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7376607 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7376608 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7376609 theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say
7376610 im not surprised the harper government is doing this because i think theyre very embarrassed the economy is softening and they have nothing to propose to canadians
7376611 i think its a charade harpers up to no good here
7376612 parliament is working parliament is not dysfunctional this is an invention by mr harper to trigger and election
7376613 we have to think about the patient and not be dogmatic about it
7376614 and thats the problem in canada were very dogmatic about public and private and you know this public and private system exists everywhere in the world except three countries canada cuba and north korea
7376615 for example a surgeon could do 90 per cent of his surgery in the public system but if theres no operating room available then he could do maybe five or 10 per cent of his practice in the private sector
7376616 but then you dont need to lose that surgeon in the public sector because hes doing a small part of his practice in the private sector
7376617 i am not part of any organized political party im a democrat
7376618 he just had high points he remembered he didnt have a concept of how long he was under there
7376619 we were talking about getting him a little recorder so he could talk about what he remembers and ahhh he doesnt want to go there
7376620 i think alec is out of the woods and allesandro i think hes at the edge of the woods
7376621 sounds like they might be able to walk out of here allesandro the end of next week and alec the end of this week
7376622 we hope were going to make a lot of money because were going to donate all of it to a charity
7376623 there are a variety of other cities across the nation new york san francisco portland that have longstanding car free days but this is the first time were trying the experiment of car free days here in seattle
7376624 to me car free day would mean leave your car and walk or take the bus
7376625 attempts to partition or divide iraq by intimidation force or other means into three separate states would produce extraordinary suffering and bloodshed
7376626 im the only one with a clear plan adopted by a majority of the foreign policy establishment 75 senators
7376627 senator biden and senator obama continue to believe that federalism is a good solution if thats what the iraqis decide
7376628 that was the resounding bipartisan message the senate sent last year passing the biden amendment which senator obama endorsed
7376629 theres a reason that hes called the third senator from pennsylvania
7376630 the folks i was shaking hands with were all talking about sen biden
7376631 im confident that he will help every democrat on the ticket
7376632 what a six term senator does is bring experience to make the agent of change effective
7376633 i think people think he could be president which is important hoyer said
7376634 joe bidens been in the united states senate since i was in the sixth grade
7376635 if anyone was criticizing the ticket before for a lack of experience that should now be put to rest
7376636 this guy has served in washington but he has never become old washington
7376637 we feel there is a racial component for some union members
7376638 there has never been an african american candidate for president and many folks around this country have never voted for an african american candidate for any office
7376639 weve had a lot of discussions about how to talk to union voters to identify closely what issue is preventing some union voters
7376640 our goal is not just to elect but to build a progressive movement
7376641 our goal is to have the same number of people on the ground and the same level of activity
7376642 were not going to be a lapdog but a watchdog
7376643 estas bajas son mucho m s importantes que el resultado del partido nadie recuerda el resultado de estos partidos realmente no tienen importancia lo que importa es que hemos perdido a dos piezas significantes para lo que intent bamos hacer a la ofensiva
7376644 m s all de javon y ronald no hay mucha experiencia entre nuestros receptores
7376645 ninguno de ellos ha jugado realmente en esta liga ser a duro encarar la temporada con s lo dos receptores que sepan lo que es jugar en la nfl
7376646 pienso que hicimos muchas cosas buenas como ofensiva pero yo realic algunos lanzamientos malos hacia el final de la primera mitad
7376647 por suerte en el comienzo del tercer cuarto logramos anotar y esa fue una buena forma de culminar mi actuaci n
7376648 creo que matt jug bien se manej bien contra una buena defensiva
7376649 siempre debes asegurarte de tener algunas herramientas a la ofensiva para quitarle presi n a un mariscal nuevo
7376650 debes contar con una buena l nea ofensiva buenos receptores y un logrado ataque terrestre si tienes todas esas piezas en su lugar pienso que est s en condiciones de avanzar con un mariscal novato detr s del centro
7376651 sabemos que los jugadores en esta posici n pueden fracasar pero si ese jugador es la persona indicada entonces no lo dudas
7376652 por lo que ha llegado el momento de tomar otras medidas y de hablar en otro tono para corregir la situaci n
7376653 ha dejado de jugar con el hambre de triunfo que le ha caracterizado es un equipo sin coraz n tenemos que volver a jugar con el coraz n con ganas esperamos que sea pronto
7376654 y de hablar fuerte con el grupo pero siempre pensando que el grupo y el cuerpo t cnico nos dieron muchas satisfacciones eso no lo olvidaremos nunca pero lo nico que queremos es que retome su m stica
7376655 el esp ritu que ten a el equipo se ha perdido ha perdido el coraz n y ha perdido la combatividad no importa ganar o perder nunca le exigimos al grupo que gane pero s le exigimos combatividad y eso se ha perdido por lo que habr que ver por d nde pasa la soluci n y rescatarlo lo antes posible
7376656 hay que volver a la esencia de esta instituci n que pelea cada pelota cada partido con el coraz n y esp ritu que siempre ha demostrado el equipo y con lo que nos ha dado tantas satisfacciones
7376657 creo que la situaci n de pachuca va m s all de la problem tica de un sistema va m s por un aspecto mental de haberse conformado con todo lo que se ha ganado y hay que acordarse que el futbol es presente y futuro y todo lo que se gana pasa a la historia
7376658 hay que mirar para adelante la situaci n todos la vivimos porque henos dejado de hacer cosas los directivos tambi n el cuerpo t cnico los jugadores para que pachuca viva esta realidad pero hemos salido de cosas peores
7376659 me sent muy bien conectando ese jonr n porque rompi el juego a nuestro favor
7376660 me sent con mucha confianza en todos mis pitcheos hoy nunca me sent nervioso
7376661 nos vamos con un peque o mal sabor en la boca pero se hizo todo lo posible hay que saber perder hay que saber reconocer al campe n muchas felicidades al equipo de hawai

7376673 it was very intimate and both guy and madonna made vows to each other and pledged to try to make their marriage strong again the ceremony lasted about an hour they turned up at the kabbalah centre in their gym clothes and changed into white robes everyone at the centre hopes that they will get through their recent rough patch
7376674 we arent jumping like we usually do we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7376675 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives no one really cared about clay aiken becoming a single dad either
7376676 its a simple little thing to get his hands set a little quicker his swing is shorter more compact and into the ball we talked for awhile he went out to the batting cage and tried it out and coaches alan trammell and gerald perry said he really swung the bat well there
7376677 he took it into the game and you saw the results
7376678 we didnt change much at all we shortened his stride so when his front foot hits his hands are set quicker and his swing is shorter he drove that ball really well
7376679 we didnt change much we just shortened his stride nothing happens until that front foot hits and once it hits quicker you get a better look at the ball and your swing is shorter and you can shift your weight through the swing that was a beautiful swing he put on the ball

7376748 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7376749 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7376750 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7376751 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7376752 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7376753 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7376754 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7376755 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7376756 yeah he thinks he is a cool teenager listening to thrash metal
7376757 he was not able to pass the second day of testing to get out here this week im hopeful hes going to be a late addition for this week and hopefully for sure next week
7376758 a couple guys on the team were laughing about it saying on the first play they were just going to let the whole defense run in and tackle me one time
7376759 i hope that doesnt happen but i wouldnt mind getting hit just to get back in the swing of things
7376760 its real important just to show what i can do
7376761 as far as making the team thats not really what im focused on i just want to go out there and make a good impression having missed two preseason games and not being in action for a while im just looking to show the coaches something
7376762 i havent really gotten into a good rhythm in any of the games hopefully this last game getting some more playing time ill be able to get in a nice rhythm and get some things going
7376763 its definitely important to go out there this week and get the team in the end zone
7376764 thats the ultimate goal thats what the quarterback needs to do is lead the team down the field and score touchdowns hopefully we can get that accomplished this week
7376765 this is uncut hip hop for the brain not the booty
7376766 that kind of music got put on the back burner and it became about what i call escapism rap thats where all you talk about is money jewelry clubs and women and dont talk about the problems around you
7376767 i just wanted to show how hypocritical it is to think like that
7376768 rap is a mirror and if youre ugly you cant blame the mirror
7376769 any time you get into these ligament sprains a lot of it is based on the severity of it but also the individual once again you talk to the medical part of it it could be a couple of weeks you talk to the player it could be two days i know he feels strongly about it but thats why i put him in the week to week category
7376770 weve got athletic guys weve got smart guys and i think everybody in that room can play multiple positions
7376771 it comes down to every single week they are going to put the best five out there and hope those guys get the job done and thats what we feel like we can do
7376772 we play a physical position with a lot of contact and things happen weve got guys that are flexible and willing to go around and play other positions it doesnt matter where you start out at its just how we finish up every week
7376773 i just want to make sure were not dealing with a long term situation
7376774 because he was healthy one week and then had an immediate setback so were going to make sure hes 100 percent ready to go when we get him back in there
7376775 for a young group tony and daryn they have good experience
7376776 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7376777 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7376778 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7376779 i just cant believe it im so excited right now i cant wait to get to next year and play in those great events
7376780 drew played really really well he put lots of pressure on me
7376781 i was a bit nervous the first nine holes he was making birdies from everywhere
7376782 i tried to make something happen being 5 down especially how well he was playing
7376783 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7376784 in 2004 i won a bronze this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7376785 hes from another planet i think hes from a whole other league he could do a cartwheel and win this thing
7376786 the gold medal has confirmed the fact that i am an outstanding sportsman
7376787 obviously this is the best of times and the worst of times
7376788 i felt like a famous singer the whole stage was only for me it was so cool
7376789 in my mind i felt good but my legs didnt have enough running behind them i felt like i was just running on one leg
7376790 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
7376791 im going home and getting something to eat and then straight to bed
7376792 i just didnt have it today its a hell of a time not to have it thats the worst 1 000 metres ive put together in years i was a spectator
7376793 im very good at knowing where to push the line if i ever disrespect a ref its because they really screwed up
7376794 he can barely walk he was in tears and he is very depressed
7376795 i have been cheering for the canucks for how long and they still havent won a stanley cup i still love them i hope canadians can think of us the same way
7376796 it was beyond skills almost it was so primeval it was just auto pilot we were flying blind rowing blind we rowed from the heart
7376797 as a girl she never cried for injuries or bleeding she would just cry for losses
7376798 im pretty angry im going to write a nasty letter this is the olympics its not that difficult to organize a three kilometre run weve never run like this before
7376799 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
7376800 come on when youre running if you see youre going to win youre going to celebrate youre going to be olympic champion youre just happy
7376801 oh lord the second place stepped out the third place stepped out hopefully usain stepped out too so im going home with the gold
7376802 im looking forward to not doing anything just sitting and not moving
7376803 its the latest in a series of pr moves designed to mislead the public from the fact that the government is asleep at the wheel here
7376804 any group that is opposed to a proven safe technology that enhances food safety is misguided
7376805 its a way to try to come in and clean up problems that are created in the middle of the food production chain i think its clearly a disincentive to clean up the problems at the source
7376806 hopefully therell be some manufacturers that will take that step
7376807 hopefully the public will be less concerned about it all the evidence suggests that theres not a risk
7376808 as far as the bush administration goes i think were seeing a whole raft of attempts to push through regulatory changes like this
7376809 ones theyre afraid they cant get passed under another president
7376810 in a way they are trying to drive us out of the coalition
7376811 it seems theyve made up their minds they want to do it themselves
7376812 its now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges
7376813 if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under
7376814 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb protesting the vote
7376815 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or
7376816 they ask why im rappin say im called to preach
7376817 i give you these new photos they are the last for me before my departure from you because i will be absent for a long time
7376818 when the plane caught fire one of its doors was blocked and everyone rushed to another door
7376819 there was a stampede and many of those on board will only be able to be identified using dna analysis
7376820 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7376821 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7376822 at a guess you arent using the right coolant and its boiled
7376823 its now the wild west out there because we can no longer easily tell where journalism ends and politics begins
7376824 reporters are biased toward conflict because it is more interesting than stories without conflict we are biased toward sticking with the pack because it is safe we are biased toward event driven coverage because it is easier we are biased toward existing narratives because they are safe and easy
7376825 we got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds too much corruption and crime in the streets its time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
7376826 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism
7376827 and that we need to finish up so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton

7376829 so far the public has only seen the sound bites and the youtube version and you have not heard from michelle
7376830 it will be a proud moment to see the unedited version the smart graceful harvard educated lawyer mother and supportive spouse
7376831 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge
7376832 shes too smart and too accomplished to stand out there and smile for 15 minutes the challenge is to get up there smooth and charming and not have too much attitude
7376833 it is intended to be very personal open and very revealing about who they are
7376834 america will know their values their life decisions and what drew them to one another
7376835 spouses arent viewed as being as threatening or as partisan as their husbands
7376836 because they are not running for office themselves they can do things voters of both sides of the aisle can appreciate involving illiteracy healthcare the environment or children they often have the background to make those kinds of things credible
7376837 very well what taxes will you be increasing to compensate for the lost revenues
7376838 become an icon of self expression and a symbol of democratic style
7376839 nike is enlisting the services of a repressive regime to crush its enemies
7376840 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply
7376841 we have no intention of tracking anyone down or asking for any punishment

7376860 education has to be in your heart you dont do it for a selfish reason
7376861 i was really surprised people made it out to seem more rural than it really is
7376862 if you set high the expectations for kids theyll meet them
7376863 im excited to stand up on that side and look out and see a bunch of pencils scratching hands raised and questions asked
7376864 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
7376865 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
7376866 the bullpen has pitched awfully well now we can use sampson along with hawkins in the late innings
7376867 terrific win team effort everybody contributed we played them all and they all contributed
7376868 all our extra men played and lots of them helped out
7376869 weve played good baseball we just havent got the offense on track in the last couple of days theyve done a good job against us
7376870 their pen shut us down and we kind of gave it up in our pen
7376871 its a tough deal because youd like to see him attack
7376872 theres also a plan in place and he didnt execute
7376873 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7376874 i havent had a chance to talk to him so i am not going to comment on that
7376875 but thats whats good its the preseason during this time you want to fine tune and you want to get your rhythm
7376876 i feel like were giving too much on the run
7376877 we started out fast but we had an inconsistent drive
7376878 you cant be giving up 80 yard drives if you want to be a great defense
7376879 guys are flying around and a lot of guys are getting to the ball
7376880 thats what you want to see as a defense with teams not getting second and third chances to get up and make plays
7376881 i hadnt had my number called in over a year it all worked out
7376882 the kick return in the fourth quarter was my fault
7376883 they put their first team against our reserves i think we should have squib kicked those are the kinds of things we can work out
7376884 we need to let individuals get enough playing time to get ready for the regular season
7376885 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lay in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
7376886 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
7376887 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
7376888 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back
7376889 this is such a huge disappointment for me i came here in great shape and the cut mark 6 75 for the final looked well within reach but somehow it was not to be today
7376890 india is expecting a medal from anju at the beijing olympics if i answer to her comments that will hurt her i am not prepared to put her in such a mental state
7376891 how can she anju decide on my credentials international amateur athletic federation had selected me in 1985 and 1986 as one of the best eight athletes in the world
7376892 anju is like a small child to me i have seen her grow before my eyes she has to grow further
7376893 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7376894 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7376895 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7376896 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7376897 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7376898 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7376899 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7376900 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7376901 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7376902 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7376903 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7376904 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7376905 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules
7376906 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7376907 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7376908 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7376909 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7376910 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7376911 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7376912 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7376913 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7376914 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7376915 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7376916 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7376917 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7376918 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised
7376919 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7376920 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised

7376935 i wish to propose a hypothesis that addresses not only the aspect of jamaicas raw athletic talent but also encompasses an explanation of seemingly diverse phenomena as our high incidence of prostate cancer one study found it to be by far the highest in the world at 304 100 000 men year our high crime rate murder capital of the world status earlier this year our high road traffic accident and fatality rate and our alleged high levels of promiscuity
7376936 what do these seemingly disparate phenomena characteristic of jamaican life have in common on close examination these phenomena are manifestations of high levels of aggressiveness and drive high libidos highly efficient muscles from persons of lean body mass and black ethnicity
7376937 on closer scrutiny all of these phenomena are either related to high circulating levels of testosterone or alternatively to high levels of responsiveness of testosterone receptors to circulating testosterone it has already been shown that the testosterone receptors of blacks are different genetically to those of whites and this difference confers increased responsiveness to testosterone

7376965 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7376966 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7376967 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is

7376991 whoever fasts in ramadan with iman and seeking reward from allah his past sins will be forgiven
7376992 the fasting person has a supplication that is answered when he opens his fast
7376993 whoever does not give up false statements i e telling lies and evil deeds and speaking bad words to others allah is not in need of his fasting leaving his food and drink
7376994 whoever prays during ramadan with iman and seeking reward from allah his past sins will be forgiven
7376995 whoever gives iftar to someone fasting he will have the same reward without decreasing the reward of the person fasting

7377010 my husband alqamah is on his deathbed i therefore came to tell you messenger of allah about his condition
7377011 messenger of allah his mother is but she is very old
7377012 may my life be a ransom for him it is my pleasure to go to him
7377013 umm alqamah tell me the truth for otherwise allah most high will reveal the truth to me what is the situation concerning your son alqamah
7377014 messenger of allah he prays much fasts a great deal and spends a great amount in charity
7377015 messenger of allah he has preferred his wife to me and has disobeyed me
7377016 umm alqamah surely your anger has prevented alqamahs tongue from pronouncing the shahadah
7377017 messenger of allah he is my son my heart cannot bear your burning him in front of me
7377018 umm alqamah allahs punishment is more severe and more lasting
7377019 messenger of allah i call upon allah most high and his angels and the muslims who are present to be my witnesses that i am pleased with my son alqamah
7377020 bilal go to him and see whether he is now able to say
7377021 it is surely true that while alqamahs mother was angry with him his tongue was tied and now that she is pleased with him his tongue is freed
7377022 you company of muhajireen and helpers if anyone favors his wife over his mother allah and his angels and all the people curse him allah does not accept his spending in charity and his uprightness unless he repents toward allah the glorious and majestic and reconciles with her and attains her pleasure because allahs pleasure consists in her pleasure and allahs anger consists in her anger
7377023 o people of basrah is this some kind of holiday of yours that i am unaware of
7377024 no but al hasan al basri is in the main gathering place of basrah giving a khutbah to the people
7377025 o people prepare for departure for very little time remains from this world prepare to move to the akhirah for there is no way to stay here do you not know that you will soon be surrendered to the place of trial do you not know that each one of you will soon be alone with his deeds and that you will be presented with your deeds to allah on the day of judgment he forbade you from sinning but you have not stopped sinning he threatened you with the hell fire but you are neither afraid nor terrified of it he has encouraged you to seek our jannah but you do not seem to desire it or long for it your white hairs are warning you of approaching death so what are you waiting for o white haired one you are able to perform good deeds so what is your excuse o one who obeys his mouth and his desires who wastes his share of the akhirah by taking his entire share in this world who persists in committing sins and evil deeds if only i knew what your excuse will be before him what argument will you put forth when you go to him you are lost and misguided so ask allah the all mighty to forgive both me and you
7377026 there are no ordinary people you have never talked to a mere mortal it is immortals whom we joke with work with marry snub and exploit immortal horrors or everlasting splendours
7377027 o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it has been prescribed for those who were before you that you may learn self restraint
7377028 o young people whoever among you has the wherewithal to marry should do so because it assists us in lowering our gazes and safeguarding our private parts whoever cannot do so should fast because fasting diminishes sexual power
7377029 o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it has been prescribed for those who were before you that you may learn self restraint fasting for a fixed number of days the month of ramadan in which the qur n was revealed a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and the criterion so whoever witnesses the month should fast it and whoever is sick or upon a journey should fast the same number of days later on allah wishes ease for you and he does not wish hardship upon you he wants that you should complete the period and that you should exalt allah for that to which he has guided you that perhaps you may be thankful
7377030 islam is built upon five things testifying that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah establishing prayer paying zak h fasting the month of ramadan and the pilgrimage to the house sah h al bukh r and sah h muslim
7377031 islam is to bear witness that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah to establish prayer to pay charity to fast the month of ramadan and to perform pilgrimage to the house if you are able to make the journey
7377032 it is to believe in allah his angels his books his messengers the last day and divine decree both the good and bad of it
7377033 you have spoken the truth tell me about excellence in faith
7377034 it is to worship allah as though you see him and though you do not see him you know that he sees you
7377035 tell me about some deed that will admit me into paradise and distance me from the hellfire
7377036 you have asked about something great yet it is very simple for one for whom allah makes it easy worship allah and do not associate anything with him in worship establish prater pay zak h fast the month of ramadan and undertake the pilgrimage to the house if you are able to do so
7377037 should i not inform you about the gates of goodness fasting is paradise charity extinguishes sins like water extinguishes fire
7377038 every deed of the human being is for himself and its reward is multiplied for him from ten to seven hundred times allah says except for fasting for truly it is for me and i alone will reward it for verily he abandoned his desires his food and his drink for my sake the one who fasts experiences two joys one upon breaking his fast and one when he meets his lord surely the breath of the fasting person is sweeter to allah than the fragrance of musk
7377039 when ramadan commences the gates of paradise are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are bound in chains
7377040 on the first night of ramadan the devils and rebellious jinn are bound in chains the gates of paradise are opened until not a single gate remains closed the gates of hell are bound shut until not a single gate remains open then a caller calls out o desirer of good go forth o desirer of evil restrain yourself allah is emancipating people from the fire every night
7377041 o people a great and blessed month is coming upon you a month containing a night better than a thousand months allah has made fasting in its days an obligation and observing prayer in its nights a voluntary act anyone who seeks nearness to allah in theis month through any virtuous act will be like one who carried out a religious obligation at another time and anyone who performs an obligatory act of worship in this month will be like one who performed seventy such acts at another time it is the month of patience and the reward for patience is paradise
7377042 whoever does not leave off false speech and false conduct allah has no need of his leaving off food and drink
7377043 when any one of you is observing the fast for the day he should neither indulge in obscene language nor raise his voice if someone insults him or quarrels with him he should say i am fasting
7377044 there are no ordinary people you have never talked to a mere mortal it is immortals whom we joke with work with marry snub and exploit immortal horrors or everlasting splendours

7377048 i have been ruined for i have had sexual relation with my wife in ramadan while i was fasting
7377049 where is the questioner go and give this in charity
7377050 shall i give this in charity to a poorer person than l by allah there is no family in between these two mountains of medina who are poorer than we
7377051 is there any camel which is not born of a she camel
7377052 abu umair what has happened to your little sparrow nughair
7377053 o gods messenger by god you will find me to be worthless goods

7377055 i have good news and bad news the good news is we have enough money to pay for our new building program the bad news is its still out there in your pockets

7377057 oh imam we are going to miss you so much we dont want you to leave
7377058 now now sister dont carry on the imam who takes my place might be even better than me

7377063 not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who fight in the cause of allah with their goods and their persons unto all in faith has allah promised good but those who strive and fight he has distinguished above those who sit at home
7377064 i am happy with the protection of allah ta alla
7377065 i have no other better protection except from allah ta alla and i am happy and satisfied with his protection
7377066 and truly for the true believing and steadfast muslim allah ta alla is their best ally and the protection of allah ta alla is greater and better for the believing men and women than even the whole of mankind
7377067 and truly for the true believing and steadfast muslim allah ta alla is their best ally and the protection of allah ta alla is greater and better for the believing men and women than even the whole of mankind
7377068 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7377069 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7377070 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7377071 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7377072 there are no ordinary people you have never talked to a mere mortal it is immortals whom we joke with work with marry snub and exploit immortal horrors or everlasting splendours
7377073 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere
7377074 the slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that theyre now feeding on one another
7377075 the u k has been really soft for the last six months
7377076 western europe overall has been flat weve not seen the growth weve seen in the last few years
7377077 the year 2009 in europe is going to look significantly worse than 2008
7377078 it was too hot not to cool down as the song goes
7377079 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up
7377080 said kenneth s rogoff a former chief economist at the international monetary fund and now a professor at harvard
7377081 exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard
7377082 that may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb
7377083 if the rest of the world economy slows the demand just isnt going to be there
7377084 when i see the headlines i worry but when i look at my order book i stop worrying
7377085 when china decides they want to build a car somebody runs a steel mill with coal and iron ore out of australia and they mine it with caterpillar dump trucks which are full of timken bearings
7377086 what is driving our success is the globalization of markets
7377087 the global slowdown is going to create some headwind for the united states
7377088 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7377089 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7377090 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7377091 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge
7377092 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7377093 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7377094 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7377095 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7377096 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption
7377097 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders it said
7377098 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7377099 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame it said
7377100 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7377101 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7377102 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity
7377103 theyve been beating up on us all year so it was nice to be here and get three wins
7377104 it seemed like we had contributions from everybody in this series
7377105 i would say it was the best one i have had this year
7377106 the bullpen picked up a lot of slack for me today i wish i could have been better im disgusted with how i threw
7377107 this afternoon the quarantine release document will be handed to the clinic dr glanville said
7377108 we are confident theres no hendra among the other horses
7377109 but we warn horse owners to be aware of the potential signs and to notify us if there are any
7377110 weve played pretty good baseball for a long stretch so eventually things are going to slow down for us one way or the other
7377111 its just a combination of the bullpen and the offense and thats not a good combination to be going wrong
7377112 right now is not the time to not be executing pitches or not having quality at bats
7377113 we have to be a team that continues to put pressure
7377114 we put up four runs today but obviously that wasnt enough
7377115 como se llama las p ginas las ventanas el internet
7377116 perez pitched 6 innings and gave up 4 runs all for naught
7377117 who cares let him pitch as many innnings stop babying him
7377118 it felt a lot like being a rookie all over again
7377119 ive been excited from the moment i knew i was coming here
7377120 it always feels good to know that somebody wants you as far as the jets i really havent had any time to reflect on all that maybe ill make sense of it during the offseason but right now we have to get going
7377121 any time you bring in an established veteran at that position it lends credibility to the huddle
7377122 were such a young team and we have so many players auditioning for jobs that when you get a player like that someone who commands respect its a big thing
7377123 its not that you dont want a young guy out there but it eases the whole team to have a proven guy at that position
7377124 thats my goal to let those guys know that i have their back when you can get everybody on offense feeling that way thats when good things can happen
7377125 con holcim se acord una distribuci n accionaria de 85 para el estado venezolano y 15 para la empresa transacci n que se ubic en us 552 millones mientras que el compromiso con lafarge fue de us 267 millones con una participaci n accionaria de 89 para el estado y el resto para la industria
7377126 se venci el plazo de la negociaci n y lamentablemente no ha sido posible obtener una negociaci n con la empresa cemex como se hizo con lafarge y holcim por lo que vamos a tomar el control operacional de sus instalaciones tal como lo establece la ley adem s entrar en vigencia el decreto de expropiaci n estamos actuando de acuerdo con las leyes respetando los derechos que protegen a los privados en nuestro pa s
7377127 the market is following on from wall street on friday night and reporting season coming in near enough to expectations macquarie private wealth divisional director martin lakos said
7377128 its pretty much in line with consensus but there are always positive and negative surprises during reporting season and were getting our fair share
7377129 were more than half way through now and the market is starting to refocus on the outlook statements from the companies and clearly the next big thing is when and if interest rates are cut
7377130 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time mr bounds said in a statement reported by fox news
7377131 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7377132 it has become clear that my call for money has gone largely unanswered
7377133 i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget of our independent expenditure unit
7377134 it is still my hope that my republican colleagues will engage in this election and help match what the democrats are doing if they do i will adjust our budget accordingly

7377139 jim rogers and others ave the time and the money to alter the course of the states future the only question is whether they have the will

7377141 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
7377142 we have yet to see the evidence that this kind of approach will work
7377143 it is extremely punitive it will have an immediate and severe effect on peoples lives
7377144 what we do have evidence for is that wrap around parenting skills courses getting people to access alcohol and other drug rehabilitation services working on the causes of this kind of chaos in peoples lives is extremely effective
7377145 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period he said
7377146 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle
7377147 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand goodman fielder said
7377148 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7377149 substantial and rapid increases in commodity costs impacted margins and added 204 million to its costs
7377150 in the second half of the year international crude oil pricing also reached record high levels resulting in an increase of 30 million in logistics costs it added
7377151 a rapid deterioration in the new zealand economy towards the end of the financial year also impacted earnings as did the weakening new zealand dollar
7377152 this was the first time in the last five years in which the business did not record double digit profit growth goodman said
7377153 the dairy business had a difficult year with rapidly escalating commodity costs resulting in raw milk costs increasing by over 60 per cent in the year goodman said
7377154 aggressive cost recovery initiatives resulted in the business taking four price rises but inevitable timing lags and a growth in private label sales had a negative impact on margins
7377155 we believe the visit will be a turning point in the two countries relationship which has been primarily an economic one to expand into all areas including politics defence and culture
7377156 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7377157 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7377158 its always at the back of your mind especially as someone who owns a business you wonder whether to keep building and reinvesting
7377159 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7377160 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back

7377182 as we are a start up company having operations in a highly competitive field mobile services it became imperative to go in for a cost optimization drive says pravin patree head facility virgin mobile india
7377183 earlier most executives stayed in five star hotels but now people in the middle and junior management who are out of town for longer duration on projects mostly end up staying in nofrills hotels
7377184 we are witnessing some movement wherein guests who earlier prefered to stay in fivestar hotels are now opting for mid priced ones
7377185 the shift of deluxe hotel users has contributed an additional 10 occupancy premium to our hotels during the last quarter
7377186 this growth has also been buttressed by the value conscious business and conference traveller and we are delivering aggressive value for money packages to our retail clients

7377190 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and olympic games and beyond
7377191 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7377192 while we do not condone mr romeros method the u s government supports his underlying message that calls for greater freedoms in china
7377193 the harsh reality is that if you got into blogging just to make money you probably wont
7377194 hes had so many things like this happen to him i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise so he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7377195 theres not a lot of history there as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7377196 really none of those guys have really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7377197 ive been in this position before when i was in denver and jay cutler was in his first year starting and i was the only receiver and brandon marshall came along
7377198 so its nothing new for me i just know what i do and i know what i can go out and bring so im just going to do that execute and make plays
7377199 there are a number of games last year he played even more for us than justin hes a guy when we run the ball he is in there play after play a physical attitude
7377200 you cant lose hunter and santana and not feel the loss at the same time our scouting staff and minor league staff got a few guys ready over the last few years
7377201 their pitching has been exceptional their young pitching in particular
7377202 we had livan hernandez at the start of the season
7377203 it worked perfectly that liriano was ready to go and we found a home for hernandez with the rockies
7377204 our guys are amazingly resilient they turned the page and moved on since june 11 our team has played very very well i think ron gardenhire and his coaching staff have done a marvelous job this year
7377205 they all started the season at rochester when we got hit with injuries we had those guys come up each one in a different way stepped in and did the job
7377206 were going to go young and develop our own players if we suffer from it well take that
7377207 we were in a meeting once talking about roster moves
7377208 a few people started to make suggestions about who we should go after bob pohlad raised his hand and said who are we to make these decisions thats why we hired terry ryan everyone agreed
7377209 there are multiple ways of being successful whatever oakland does works our way works for us it might not work for someone else but its our way
7377210 he made the adjustment and he was dominant same as last year
7377211 he went from being a good starting pitcher to a dominant starting pitcher his one flaw is he can care too much and that manifests itself in his delivery it affects his command and he loses the ability to throw his slider
7377212 we all watch him with interest were excited and were pulling for him
7377213 we can sign him in the off season but that would be unlikely
7377214 are you willing to pay for six years for getting four years of pitching
7377215 playing at old crosley field johnny lewis hit a ball off the wall in center field where the dividing line for in play was a wooden planking on the wall hit concrete and the ball is in play and off the wood home run
7377216 anybody who cant hear the difference of a ball hitting wood or hitting concrete must be blind
7377217 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7377218 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7377219 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7377220 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7377221 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7377222 before dawn on aug 27 2006 the atlanta bound commuter jet that was comair flight 5191 crashed on take off from blue grass airport in lexington killing 49 of the 50 people on board including these six from madison county
7377223 i think its a fitting tribute i think its just amazing that a teenager could spearhead this and get it done
7377224 theres something about the feeling of this evening thats so reminiscent of that morning
7377225 it makes me feel honored and humbled at the same time
7377226 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7377227 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7377228 we believe the visit will be a turning point in the two countries relationship which has been primarily an economic one to expand into all areas including politics defense and culture
7377229 the senate also showed good judgment by not adding wind coverage to the nfip and giving strong consideration to the findings of the government accountability office study that warned of the operational challenges and possible financial consequences
7377230 increasing the operational burden on the nfip is unnecessary given that there is adequate wind coverage capacity in every state through either the traditional private market or state residual markets backed by private insurers
7377231 you havent climbed three flights of stairs since we voted for ike
7377232 well to be honest dr addison is a complete jerk and everybody hates him but if youre in serious trouble theres nobody better
7377233 its awesome im busy can always be busier but im lucky to be as busy as i am now i wrestle pretty much every weekend and thats all i can ask for
7377234 everybodys opinion is just something that motivated me to try and up my game in every aspect if people thought i was missing that one thing obviously there was something that wasnt connecting me to everybody which is the point in this business is to connect with everybody no matter who they are
7377235 right now things are going good theres a decent amount of young guys that are looking to work hard and earn their stripes and take the next step to become a better performer and a better pro wrestler so i think right now all the companies are doing sort of what they need to do to work together and help and keep everyone busy because thats the only way you can really learn in this business is to wrestle as much as you possibly can in front of different people and different crowds
7377236 there are a handful of groups that are doing right for this business in florida im pretty impressed with it actually
7377237 just having the opportunity to do the things ive done in ring of honor thats the first major test if i can stay there as long as i possibly can and make it there i can see no reason why i couldnt go anywhere else and stay for just as long
7377238 sometimes when that camera gets in your face i just lock up im not going to deny it its truthful and sometimes things dont come off the way i really feel about them its like anything anybody does like an actor tom cruise wasnt tom cruise right off the bat its all a matter of just finding your niche and finding out whats comfortable to you and what can put you into that character the easies thats the only way that you do get better
7377239 when you work with people you teach them the things you know and i try not to teach anything outside of my boundaries because obviously i dont know it if i dont have an understanding of it i wont try to teach somebody that it brings you back to your first day your second day so as you teach the people you kind of go through those steps again and you catch a lot of your flaws that you were making and didnt realize you were making because you havent been critiqued specifically as you are critiquing this person
7377240 it was a great opportunity when i was there and my face was on tv a lot in my four or five months that i was actually going on tv so i appreciated the opportunity there
7377241 me and austin aries got suspended we were asked to leave a ring of honor show early and miss it and fly into orlando for the pay per view we let them know that we would be making it to the pay per view but we had to fulfill our commitment to ring of honor as well we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that it was their decision and it was right in their book so im not going to argue with them about that
7377242 its just something in this business if you say you are going to be there you want to be there no matter what thats the way that people can believe in you and trust you in a business where trust is very important
7377243 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7377244 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7377245 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these
7377246 the legislature was trying to make a philosophical statement with hb133 we want families in private health insurance which is ok
7377247 but i dont think they really thought through the ramifications
7377248 there is not a limit on the out of pocket expenses they upp families could potentially pay and that puts children at great risk
7377249 while choosing the lowest price car insurance policy is most peoples objective it is also important to know exactly what is and isnt covered drivers make a lot of assumptions about their policies so its best to read all terms and conditions carefully and to regularly review the terms
7377250 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7377251 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7377252 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7377253 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7377254 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7377255 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7377256 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7377257 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7377258 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7377259 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7377260 if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad
7377261 i have a very nice full bodied petite sirah that has a wonderful flavor im also pretty proud of a white cabernet and a white merlot we bottled in 2003 our cabernet sauvignon has been rated at 91 by the wine spectator our white 90 thats pretty amazing
7377262 i own tequila tres rios a bar in palm beach a tattoo shop in las vegas and the vineyard dude just because im still wild on stage doesnt mean im still f up im really proud of what were doing we just bottled a great white cab at about 19
7377263 it follows the chronology of the dirt closely from when we played at the whisky the famous go go club in west hollywood thats been home to rockers since 1964
7377264 we just went in and made a record and im having the time of my life i was an a when i first started at 23 now im older 47 i dont need to do that s anymore
7377265 theres a video from the new album that shows some girls in a glass shower in the back of our bus and there i am watching judge judy
7377266 right now we are right at the place we want to be
7377267 it ended up being 36 days together counting training camp or whatever it might have been but the ultimate goal was for us to be in the gold medal game all that we built up for turned out to be one of the best games in olympic history
7377268 it feels great like i said we were going to leave it all out on the line no matter what
7377269 but i thought spain did a great job too i think especially at the beginning of the game we were missing a lot of easy reads on defense we missed some easy opportunities and obviously when you play against international teams if you let them get off to a good start they get their confidence if we get off to a great start and just kind of put on the gas in the first quarter theyll kind of let up because they know they really cant catch up to us but if you give them confidence in the first quarter then theyll be able to respond
7377270 because spain had all the momentum in the first quarter and when we made subs the energy kind of picked up
7377271 it just goes to show that what i do on the basketball court is not taken for granted
7377272 not too many players who are not all stars make an olympic team
7377273 both teams were making the other defense look pretty bad
7377274 but both teams just didnt want to give up spain played great pau gasol had a heck of a game we did some poor things defensively but our guys just kind of took over on the offensive end in the second half and that really kind of got us the win
7377275 its a different feeling because youre representing your country and obviously having the anthem being played at the end when were standing on the stage those type of things that dont happen in the nba when you win a championship
7377276 because in the nba youve got your city your family cheering for you and when youre playing for the u s youve got everybody cheering for you

7377280 it feels great like i said we were going to leave it all out on the line no matter what

7377289 is definitely going to be my time to not do anything
7377290 you can call us brave or stupid but were willing to experiment
7377291 if you look back on albums like point of entry or turbo and then compare them to painkiller screaming for vengeance or british steel every ones been different you can call us brave or stupid but were willing to experiment you may not always get what you expect but at the same time on every album theres a selection of songs that every priest fan loves
7377292 we want people to try to listen to it in the same way we wrote it

7377322 you can teach anybody to propagate different things but to go to a class and be able to walk away with a courthouse hydrangea and put it in your own yard we just thought that would be more interesting than your plain old hydrangea

7377338 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7377339 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7377340 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7377341 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7377342 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

7377595 all i wanna do is bang bang bang bang and clank clank cha ching and take ya monayyy
7377596 i had learned through the years to follow the puppet creatures cues obediently at one time years before the visit at the medicine shop i was crazy or foolish enough to call the puppet and its visits exactly what they were outrageous nonsense right to the face of that clown puppet i would say take your nonsense somewhere else or possibly im sick of this contemptible and disgusting nonsense but none of these outbursts counted for anything the puppet simply waited until my foolhardy craziness had passed and then continued through the motions which had been prepared for that particular visit so i examined the prescription form the creature had passed across the counter to me and i noticed immediately that what was written upon it was nothing but a chaos of scrawls and scribbles which was precisely the sort of nonsense i should have expected during the medicine shop visit i knew that it was my part to play along with the clown puppet although i was never precisely certain what was expected of me from previous experience i learned that it was futile to determine what would eventually transpire during a particular visit because the puppet creature was capable of almost anything for example once it visited me when i was working through the night at a skid row pawn shop i told the thing that it was wasting my time unless it could produce an exquisitely cut diamond the size of a yo yo then it reached under its pale smock like garment and rummaged about its hand seeking deep within its pantaloons well lets see it i shouted at the clown puppet as big as a yo yo i repeated not only did it come up with an exquisitely cut diamond that was generally speaking as large as a yo yo but the object that the puppet thing flashed before my eyes brilliant in the pawn shop dimness was also made in the form of a yo yo and the creature began to lazily play with the yo yo diamond right in front of me spinning it slowly on the string that was looped about one of those pale puppet fingers throwing it down and pulling it up over and over while the facets of that exquisitely cut diamond cast a pyrotechnic brilliance into every corner of the pawn shop

7377603 as i walkd through the wilderness of this world and i laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man cloathed with raggs standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do

7377695 el que no trabaja no come es un lema universal que han suscrito personas tan distintas como san agust n y lenin nuestra sociedad no vive del aire ni del man sino del trabajo y del ahorro
7377696 esto no deber a ser objeto de pol mica entre la izquierda y la derecha
7377697 no tiene nada que ver con los m todos de evaluaci n tradicionales y aqu es donde resulta m s dif cil ponerse de acuerdo el esfuerzo se asume y se aprende sobre todo cuando la tarea tiene sentido
7377698 del sentido del trabajo y del ejemplo de los profesores
7377699 vincular la pedagog a del esfuerzo a la selectividad que es lo que hacen quienes cifran el problema en si hay m s o menos ex menes m s o menos repeticiones o si stas tienen lugar al cabo del curso o del ciclo es otra cuesti n en realidad es tanto como decir los que no llegan hasta el final en esta carrera es simplemente porque no se esfuerzan y ahora llegan demasiados a pesar de no haberlo hecho a la clase media y alta le gusta pensar que est ah porque se lo ha ganado y s lo por ello pero eso tiene poco que ver con la realidad
7377700 hablando de esfuerzo la cuesti n es que tambi n se esfuercen el centro y el profesor dedicando m s recursos y tiempo a los alumnos que lo necesiten entonces y s lo entonces podr n exigir que su esfuerzo sea correspondido
7377701 es un camino in til un alumno no se esforzar m s por eso porque el esfuerzo depende de la motivaci n y de la confianza o esperanza en el futuro
7377702 est perdiendo la capacidad de so ar en horizontes que merezcan la pena inmersos en el materialismo y la mediocridad cultural
7377703 les interesa si el ni o va bien en matem ticas pero no si el maestro cultiva en el cr o su inteligencia emocional
7377704 hay que educar en el esfuerzo s pero hay que saber c mo
7377705 no hay ninguna teor a del aprendizaje que no relacione el esfuerzo y su influencia en el nivel de xito o fracaso del alumnado pero tampoco es el elemento nico y determinante
7377706 resistirse al modelo de xito f cil que a diario preconizan campa as medi ticas combatirlo en casa y en la escuela
7377707 hay que cuestionar el modelo de ense anza que trata de instruir de forma homog nea a un alumnado muy diverso conviene acercarse al aprendizaje que facilita tareas pr cticas de cierto xito para ir despu s aumentando su complejidad
7377708 la familia debe actualizar su formaci n con apoyos en el tratamiento de etapas como la infancia y la adolescencia para superar modelos excesivamente permisivos y excesivamente rigurosos o punitivos
7377709 sin esfuerzo no hay aprendizaje pero el esfuerzo no es gratuito
7377710 el esfuerzo no es una condici n sino el resultado de un proceso en el que interviene la motivaci n del alumno se esforzar si piensa que vale la pena por tanto es un problema que se traslada a los profesores y al sistema educativo
7377711 siempre ha habido profesores magn ficos que han conseguido eso
7377712 no se puede estar lanzando mensajes del tipo aprenda ingl s en cuatro d as y sin esfuerzo
7377713 de los pocos sitios donde se cultiva todav a esa cultura del esfuerzo ah s y no en los discursos pol ticos hay motivo de preocupaci n s pero quiz en la escuela se intenta que la distancia entre lo que se predica y lo que se hace sea m s corta
7377714 esto podr a ser resultado de una menor morosidad en comparaci n con otros pr stamos aun as no se puede descartar un impacto en las tasas de colocaci n y una reducci n de la oferta en pesos para incentivar los de uvr

7377723 as people get richer they want to spend a larger share of their income on health

7377736 while thomas paines stirring prose helped to rally public opinion in support of the war of independence in 1776 his later writings were 180 degrees out of synch with the christian ethos that prevailed in the united states it was in those later writings after the war of independence the rights of man and the age of reason that paine expressed the sentiments which mr ellis holds forth as the true values of 1776 paines social and political ideas were essentially the revolutionary and bloody socialism that afflicted the world in the 1789 french revolution
7377737 weve heard how the value of the dollar affects gas prices and indeed the price of everything i was pleased that my request for a hearing on such was granted by the financial services committee and we were able to hear some very informative testimony certainly domestic policies regarding off shore oil drilling bans ethanol mandates refining capacity and cafe standards are interventionist and harmful enough in the energy market but how does foreign policy affect gas prices one important factor is that oil on the world market has been priced in dollars exclusively since 1973

7377739 our third president had a way of saying the most with the fewest possible words i realized i cannot afford the luxury of wallowing in this self pity i do not seek the easy way out and that is what brought me to this melodramatic rant in the first place my unwillingness to accept the premise that americans by some miracle of nature have rights that supersede all other nationalities has caused this friendship to become an unfortunate casualty of war i have to accept that my stubborn adherence to the principle that all people are created with equal rights and deserve equal protection of their rights means that i must bear the heartache of lost friends occasionally so that my children might some day be free

7377758 how can a christian vote for a candidate that supports the murder of children by abortion

7377785 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7377786 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7377787 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7377788 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7377789 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters
7377790 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well
7377791 ive caught them climbing up the walls and ive asked them what theyre doing and they say oh were playing ninjas
7377792 they give you a bit of cheek and climb up the wall and give you a bit more cheek and off they go

7377800 blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me 12 rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you
7377801 i have been very zealous for the lord god almighty the israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too
7377802 go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the lord for the lord is about to pass by

7377811 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
7377812 immediate effects of red bull are that it can cause the heart rate to speed up and lead to irregular beating
7377813 we certainly know if youre consuming energy drinks on a regular basis it can interfere with regular sleep patterns
7377814 red bull is a stimulant and when you mix a stimulant with a depressant you basically get a wide awake drunk
7377815 normally when youve been drinking your body gets tired but when you add red bull and you stay awake the danger is that you can actually drink more because not only are you awake but you feel pretty good
7377816 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people
7377817 i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put dreams first a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7377818 i think its a very smart choice together theyre going to be a very good pair
7377819 some of the concerns thrown at obama have now been disqualified by biden it makes the foreign policy argument by mccain obsolete
7377820 he has the foreign policy experience republicans criticize obama for not having
7377821 she is a great example of a student activist who has gone on to do big things to know her and have worked with her has been very exciting
7377822 its a little warmer than last time we were here
7377823 we saw dozens and dozens of people collapsing from the heat
7377824 a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency
7377825 joe biden brought democrats and republicans together to pass the 1994 crime bill putting 100 000 cops on the streets and starting an eight year drop in crime across the country
7377826 the benefits of an organic diet are that they contain no preservatives no pesticides 40 percent more antioxidants and the food is overall healthier
7377827 conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers to support plant growth while organic farmers apply natural fertilizers such as manure or compost to feed soil and plants
7377828 i started an organic diet about a half year ago
7377829 i didnt like the fact that i was eating food containing chemicals organic is overall a lot healthier
7377830 it organic food is much more fresh the fruits and vegetables are outstanding
7377831 organic food is definitely on the rise our society promotes health and this is the healthiest form of food you can get
7377832 so many stores such as trader joes and kroger have become much more popular
7377833 i compared our dining centers to fast food restaurants i was surprised to find that the dining center food has way more calories and a much higher fat content than most fast food restaurants
7377834 its a huge honor for those two colleges that kind of recognition provides external validation of the quality programs in those colleges
7377835 for the college of education the faculty include very productive scholars who bring recognition to their institution in the college of fine arts weve been fortunate to hire faculty who are at the top of their game creatively and who enjoy teaching students
7377836 weve had a real turnover in the last six or eight years and a lot of our new faculty have been very active in their scholarly pursuits
7377837 we are starting to see more and more of the faculty members pushing the students to get their work out there and thats a big part of it
7377838 the curious incident of the dog in the night time
7377839 its a start we found a way to get the win but were certainly going to need to play a lot better if we want success in the future starting on sunday
7377840 it kind of looked like we were playing underwater in the first half for some reason we didnt look sharp i think a huge reason is when you start five freshmen there are nerves to deal with
7377841 fortunately we regrouped in the second half and came out strong for about 10 15 minutes but then i thought we fell back into being a little too casual again
7377842 it was a good feeling breaking the ice and getting out there
7377843 i played defense for three or four years and i havent scored in so long honestly it was just like this huge relief that i finally did it being in college and doing it was great
7377844 the ball was dished out after the goalie cleared it and i just put my head down and drilled it
7377845 did you see all of those sexy girls out there tonight
7377846 it makes you relive your youth i loved it before and i still love it
7377847 its just too bad they had to lose a member before i could see them i dont think theyll ever be as popular as they were but i think theyll be able to hold out for a few more years
7377848 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7377849 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7377850 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference

7377852 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7377853 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7377854 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7377855 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7377856 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7377857 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7377858 no i think id like to enjoy it a little more thank you
7377859 it was a platonic type of endorsement shes just doing what shes supposed to be doing
7377860 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
7377861 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags
7377862 and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics but there is a whole in between area that doesnt get talked about
7377863 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7377864 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7377865 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7377866 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence

7377872 s socava el liderato de fortu o porque cualquier cosa que ocurra contraria a lo que fortu o dijo que era su deseo se le va a se alar como muestra de falta de liderato
7377873 para fortu o el conflicto con de castro obviamente es un espacio muy favorable que se abre en el sentido de que al pedirle la renuncia a jorgito de castro est siendo compatible con la petici n que le ha hecho al gobernador de que deber a renunciar y lo pone en una situaci n de credibilidad
7377874 our rallies have attracted hundreds of thousands of people in the past nearly 15 days which were all peaceful
7377875 i want to start a blog is anyone else doing it if i see someone else is i can pitch to my management that its a good idea
7377876 we are out with end users side by side with them in their daily lives and walking the streets with them
7377877 weve ridden in the helicopters chasing drunk drivers we have been in the cop cars weve gone through fire training school
7377878 when we went to the fire training school we understood for the first time how firemen are thinking and what their challenges are
7377879 controls have to be in just the right places the push to talk switch has to be in just the right place so that the center of gravity will lead you to having your thumb in the right place at the right time
7377880 the top display and a side display will change color to signify significant status changes such as if someone hits the emergency button
7377881 if the responder hits the emergency button all the radios in the area will go orange
7377882 rewritable dont even think about it some of the read only disks are better than others but its too early to know nobody can guarantee that cds will be usable in 15 or 20 years
7377883 it seems like the belts are going to remain very stable
7377884 that platform is going to outlast magnetic tape they get a little brittle but with good climate control they can apparently last a good long while
7377885 there seems to be a society of audio gnomes who have and maintain old audio equipment and mr wizard taps into them for replacement parts
7377886 we hope to release the rest of them through early 1969 by the end of this year
7377887 that process had just begun when the jfk assassination records collection act of 1992 came into being
7377888 so it was done fast and it was done by amateurs
7377889 as they are moving into transactional activities be it filing your taxes applying for social security benefits or getting your license renewed the contributional value that government web sites are making is huge
7377890 its impossible to scale massive cloud architectures if you have to rely on polling
7377891 if we dont get to something we can come back to it
7377892 most of the soldiers just knew how to get on the web and check their e mail
7377893 its built on quality not quantity were not trying to see how many students we can push through we want to give them an avenue to start a new career
7377894 when youre teaching in a traditional classroom after about 45 minutes you get the deer in headlights look from your students in webex you cant see facial expressions
7377895 you can now double triple or quadruple your data capacity in the same footprint using less energy

7377898 i love to read about government grants so ill go online and enjoy lots of words
7377899 i want a grant what do i need to do how can i accomplish what i want to accomplish and how can government content support me
7377900 you can see how they pay attention to different audiences using the site and different actions they want to accomplish
7377901 we want to make sure that when it happens folks are ready for this
7377902 network operators should be checking with vendors now to make sure theyre ready for four byte numbers
7377903 if theyre not they should be planning to get capable routers as soon as possible

7377909 usulan pak hidayat itu bagus sekali tetapi memang untuk beberapa tahun ini masih diperlukan kpk mengikuti setiap pembahasan apbn di raker raker panitia anggaran dengan pemerintah
7377910 dari pengalaman saya 3 tahun di panitia anggaran dan 9 tahun sebagai anggota dpr ri saya berkesimpulan memang diperlukan untuk beberapa tahun ini kpk ikut sebagai peninjau dalam pembahasan rapbn agar republik indonesia tercinta ini setahap demi setahap semakin membaik dan mampu meminimalisir korupsi
7377911 kpk harus berani menindaklanjuti indikasi indikasi korupsi yang sudah terbuka ke publik siapapun itu biarpun mereka mempunyai kekuatan politik yang dahsyat jadi jangan tebang pilih lagi karena rakyat sudah makin pintar memahami setiap pernyataan pejabat pejabat publik termasuk pimpinan kpk

7377924 absurdly profitable company seeks journalist with ten years experience and a harvard mba for extremely highly paid low stress job in which he can wear nice suits and loaf around in air conditioned splendor making the very occasional executive decision requirements acute discomfort in the presence of spreadsheets inability to play golf poorly concealed loathing of corporate life knowledge of ancient greek

7377926 i wrote that song as a stalker it was raining and i was sitting there in front of the house watching her come home from a date after we were divorced i was imagining what she did on this date and watching her giving him a kiss i went home and wrote this song
7377927 it is nights like this that we all take a look at ourselves and remember that we should probably keep our day jobs
7377928 good ideas at this agency come from everyone and many times they come from the most refreshingly unexpected sources so why not engage the softballers
7377929 i came to run hard and play hard and i walk out of here needing to think hard
7377930 i wasnt going to come to the post game but when weiny handed me the pen and told me to go out and get them how could i resist
7377931 there is no better feeling than to win the opener with such a great defensive effort this is a league where defense makes the difference
7377932 we had the timely hitting when we needed it the back to back doubles by
7377933 dean has always had that calm demeanor i think he still listens to bob marley and burns incense before each game
7377934 i asked the umpire to check the ball for dents
7377935 well see next week if you guys can score like that against a real team a y amp r team with a championship banner
7377936 you just dont talk smack like that in our house well be ready for them next week
7377937 it is the co ed softball version of the hack a shaq a pretty low place to go in rec league softball
7377938 netta started a square dance cheer behind the plate which totally took the pressure off me i threw strikes and the defense made the plays behind me
7377939 we still knew we were going home smiling at that point
7377940 i just had a good feeling at the start of the inning
7377941 i have no idea why coach would compare us to the lakers
7377942 wir haben gravierende fehler gemacht besa en keinen mut obwohl die mannschaft mit viel selbstvertrauen in diese partie ging
7377943 erstens weil wir in der ersten halbzeit gut gespielt haben und zweitens weil wir nach dem 1 2 die situation gut gel st haben
7377944 mainz hat uns den schneid abgekauft das wollten wir eigentlich mit mainz machen
7377945 wir hatten in der zweiten halbzeit zu viele torchancen als dass ich zufrieden sein k nnte den punkt haben wir uns redlich verdient
7377946 unfortunately for myself and other students and individuals across the state media sentry has not only ignored your agencys directive to secure a license but has also continued to actively investigate my personal activities well after it was informed of its legal obligation to secure a license from your agency for such actions
7377947 a white house staffer or contractor would collect from a journal e mail folder in the microsoft exchange system copies of e mails sent and received by white house employees
7377948 we were simply out played in every aspect of the game it was later reported that many of the teams key players made a visit to
7377949 they seemed to be having a good time singing along with our mariachi songs and drinking
7377950 we will bounce back and get things right next week i am sure of that
7377951 it was the coachs decision why dont you go ask him
7377952 there has to be an age rule she is too quick for this league this is just like the damn danny almonte story all over again
7377953 there is no minimum age rule in this league the only requirement is that people work in advertising and since greg subcontracted the last hgi media plan to his intern erica she is perfectly legal
7377954 she told me that she always thought advertising would be a good fall back if the softball thing doesnt work out
7377955 bidens preternatural disposition to robin hooding taxpayers and corporations which involves going after the
7377956 currency mismanagement can undermine economic growth and make capital growth possibilities more constricted especially under superfluous new regulations concomitant with the current fiat currency stupidity stable currencies are paramount to economic growth without stable units of account one cannot effectively tabulate the magnitude of factors upon the economy as well as the degree of performance currently undergone
7377957 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7377958 hey your blog is really entertaining and informative thanks for taking the time to write it i am in the process of starting a small business and while your blog sometimes scares me it also inspires me i had a couple of questions for you if you wouldnt mind giving some tips should i just ask them here in a comment
7377959 i came up with the idea when i realized there are so many cool parents out there and there wasnt a lot of cool baby clothes at the time and i thought about how we do vintage shopping and if the shirt is funny we buy it so that is what i tried to create with punkster
7377960 do something that you are passionate about and love something beyond just
7377961 we wont even ask about the cost of last fridays solitaire game
7377962 which drew some major applause from the audience you can tell from this track why these guys have opened for such bands as tegan and sara and of course death cab
7377963 release the set list that night consisted of songs from a number of their past releases and wasnt too heavily focused on their latest album
7377964 there truly was a feeling that something special was happening there that night
7377965 well see thats a fair question i just dont know the answer
7377966 i think hes moving pretty quickly up the learning curve
7377967 you saw it from the first quarter to the fourth quarter so hes making a lot of progress
7377968 we knew it was a process and you had a hope that it could get answered saturday with troy but he didnt have an opportunity to prove that so were still looking to make that decision as we go
7377969 we got to see how kyle is doing and we got to see how troy is doing thats something that we wouldnt want to make right now
7377970 i thought he made some good plays he had a chance to make a couple of big plays i think when he looks at it on tape hes going to feel like if i just put the ball on the money we got a chance to win the game big plays are the difference in this league and those are throws that he can make
7377971 im going to prepare myself to be ready at any time
7377972 the next time i get the opportunity im going to make the best of it
7377973 lopinion g n rale dans le parti est favorable la s paration
7377974 as long as the sun and moon remain the nation will remember your name
7377975 and to be sitting in front you guys tonight and be on top of the world
7377976 i think we did a hell of a job putting america basketball back where its supposed to be
7377977 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team bonded together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7377978 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7377979 these players have given of themselves for three years theyve given up their summers theyve bought into the whole team thing they set their personal egos aside theyve done everything asked of them
7377980 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7377981 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7377982 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7377983 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7377984 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason

7378021 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7378022 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7378023 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today

7378025 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice

7378055 a lot of people didnt know what blacksmiths did and without blacksmiths you wouldnt have a lot of your civilized tools you have today
7378056 i think its unique really for the size and focus that it has on the blacksmithing this one im not aware of any others of this size and scope that bring in this many blacksmiths
7378057 i find blacksmithing is that you can take something as cold and unyielding as a piece of steel put it in the fire and bring it up to a forging temperature and you can make it do some pretty amazing things
7378058 we can make anything anything within reason we dont have the tolerance like machinist would have but shovels and rakes and forks and all of the tools that pioneer people had
7378059 are you all finding this pretty could how they make all of this stuff
7378060 the big thing is the hot iron most young people have not seen a hot iron and how it can be bent easily and how bright it is and to see welds where the sparks fly its just something they havent seen

7378072 london will hold the next olympics we hope that we will have more chances to communicate with qingdao organizers and take some of that experience back to london

7378101 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
7378102 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
7378103 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
7378104 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
7378105 unlike u s audiences who have long been used to antiheroes from westerns and film noir korea s more traditional viewers have preferred screen heroes who defeat evil and triumphantly solve all the problems but since 2000 that has changed

7378112 if students are not on an athletic team in high school and not in the band chorus or rotc theres not a whole lot of travel and the kids lose a good opportunity
7378113 i hope i am wrong but my view is that this crisis will take one to two years to stabilise
7378114 what worries me is that no one seems to know the full amount of off balance sheet securities circulating in the financial markets
7378115 and this is what frightens me most no one can tell me how much more will be written off
7378116 prices rose to set new all time highs supported by a decline in us crude oil inventories
7378117 it was the first time inventory fell below the psychologically critical 300 million barrel threshold since january

7378142 the basic idea behind celebrity politics is in the era before television in an era where radio was the main source of most information people werent really getting to see and know politicians
7378143 but they see and know the movie stars and so the link between celebrity and politics is the same as its always been drawing attention to a candidate
7378144 celebrities act they look pretty and get angry about paparazzi
7378145 lets leave the campaigning and trash talking to the politicians and go back to sunbathing in saint tropez
7378146 it really frustrates me when people say who are they to say anything
7378147 i think its a good thing and anybody whos in a position of influence and prominence in acting entertainment sports or media should use that platform because theyve got a microphone to make a difference
7378148 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognise the military backed constitution

7378160 a lot of people havent read his books and want to feel connected to him
7378161 he really was an extraordinary son and brother and he is an extraordinary father and i want to encourage people to take in that human dimension i do not feel as though it is at all unrelated to the kind of president hes going to be

7378163 were anxious to see how that works and were very very pleased the university has decided to take that approach
7378164 weve been asking for that approach for a long time
7378165 weaving a product into the entertainment as opposed to breaking up the entertainment which is what ads tend to do is a smart strategy
7378166 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7378167 the consumer increasingly has the power to change the way they consume content and that has really driven the whole trend towards product placement
7378168 those placements are not designed to jump out at you as an ad would but its still very very powerful its not explicit advertising but we do know that while youre watching a program all of the content that you see as a whole goes in
7378169 i believe people will tolerate you talking about yourself in a 30 second commercial or even a 60 second commercial but when it gets to 30 minutes youre pushing the limit when youre conscious it is a product placement it becomes distracting
7378170 i think they stopped it at 60 to 70 brands represented in that movie if you have too much product placement it just becomes an ad and people are not that interested in watching a two hour ad
7378171 it is part of the thinking these days but clients still have to weigh up whether the amount they pay to have their product in a certain program or film offers a good return
7378172 this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7378173 gt nyt op ed but from an online engagement perspective sending a text message with first to know information to such an intimate device only furthers our love affair and affirms our growing personal trust and connection with obama

7378175 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested

7378185 basketball has never been my favorite event before but im really enjoying the
7378186 the one im watching at the time i e the one thats on i keep discovering stuff like last night i hadnt seen trampoline it was off the hook these little girls on these trampolines going 30 feet in the air they get some major air on these trampolines and watching stuff like badminton its not the backyard game we played i just love the olympics because i ran track when i was in high school and was a swimmer in college i understand the events on another visceral kind of level
7378187 from 1990 to 2004 daily returns of vix and the s amp p 500 had a correlation of
7378188 mommy i love you so much when i grow up i want to marry you in six years when im all grown up
7378189 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7378190 edwards said after doing his trademark backflip off the car in victory lane
7378191 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7378192 oh we got second place we should have got first
7378193 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7378194 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7378195 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7378196 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7378197 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7378198 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7378199 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7378200 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7378201 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7378202 saving the dollar jobs and freedom a no nonsense look at economic realities
7378203 there is only ever one human being in the womb
7378204 i felt its been coming even when i was 123 on the money list i tweaked a couple of things which is mainly taking the bogeys out the last three weeks ive been taking the bogeys out of play when you do that along with making a lot of birdies youve got a chance at winning
7378205 there was only one or two guys at 11 and only guy at 10 and i was playing with him brad fritsch
7378206 the hole finally opened up for me going into today i was third in greens in regulation but i had seven three putts
7378207 the course is a little quirky it can bite you in spots where you dont think it can its a course where you have to be really patient the putts have to start falling sometime i was just waiting for it to open
7378208 at some point in time in all our careers were going to win our last golf tournament and when you win it you obviously dont think thats going to be your last one
7378209 when i won this tournament in 06 i thought i was just going to light it up
7378210 i tackled tom about as well as usc tackled vince young
7378211 you try to eliminate those thought because those thoughts are counterproductive to winning a golf tournament
7378212 so you battle through those and keep pushing through those
7378213 its fun to be in the hunt but its disappointing not to win
7378214 i was feeling like if i shot 10 under today i could win the golf tournament
7378215 if i get to 13 under that is tough at the end of the day
7378216 that there should be no mowing the grass this labor day weekend your country needs you

7378276 there were rumours that the building would be demolished for a new library
7378277 when we evaluated the site it was clearly of heritage value to the area and obviously at risk as it is not listed on the citys heritage register so it was included at the last minute as one of our top 10 sites
7378278 it was part of the very earliest settlement of vancouver and provided housing for many people who worked in the downtown and in the port area
7378279 they didnt take a look at the complex and say two old heritage houses and a character building
7378280 the people who live in heatley block the majority feel very passionately about wanting to stay there
7378281 its got tons of character and it was well kept by the owners
7378282 the way this purchase was done it was very much below the radar
7378283 what came out of that was to place a library as close as possible to strathcona elementary school
7378284 and also no heritage buildings would be demolished in order to build a new library
7378285 if the new library branch were situated there it would become a central hub for the whole area everything already takes place there
7378286 if there were a development in my neighbourhood where we felt like we were going to lose one of our few valuable buildings i would have concerns too
7378287 but as trustees we work with the community consultation process and the citys real estate department and i understand the search for the site was quite challenging
7378288 we were quite excited when we heard we had a site and frankly we werent aware that there were heritage preservation concerns with heatley block at that time but we want to address those concerns
7378289 its quite a good thing because it will give everyone something to measure the building with all of this comes about because of what the residents have said
7378290 heritage vancouver has been calling for many years for an update of the heritage register
7378291 not going to be the disaster some people might see
7378292 but habib a student of history says that only means the bubble is about to burst
7378293 if you are thinking about selling the stars are aligned perfectly for you i say this last month was the peak because people always get into homes before school starts and we are seeing some softening right now
7378294 give up a couple of lattes and buy the house you want
7378295 i would say the federal government has the same view on this as we do
7378296 we want to do a stunning job of staging great ceremonies at bc place in 2010 we need to represent the interests of the country in the most beautiful poignant and emotional way
7378297 we want to tell a great story and thats who we are and i think thats what they expect of us
7378298 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
7378299 they have many people involved with us in many ways and theyre working hard with us to make sure we do the very best with the resources we have
7378300 were working very well together and i just think the federal government like any other partner we have wants to make sure we perform at a very high level
7378301 intends to invest 20 million towards the opening ceremony of the olympic games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
7378302 is it direction control veto its all much more suggestive
7378303 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
7378304 the memo is one piece of communication but the truth of the matter is that we didnt see what john furlong said back and maybe the confident message he has given follows a reply to this memo
7378305 these kinds of debates go back and forth over locations contracts the legacy
7378306 these kinds of negotiations are ongoing and it will probably occur until the torch is snuffed out in vancouver in 2010 it will probably even affect the final report but this happens in every country
7378307 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
7378308 theres no political involvement at all with regard to how canada will be presented to the world other than our desire to see vanoc the vancouver olympic organizing committee succeed in presenting the 2010 games and canada to the world
7378309 a great ceremonies that will take canada out to the world is going to be the result of collaboration and co operation and input from many many different places
7378310 on behalf of canadian taxpayers we want to make sure that federal dollars are spent in a way thatll promote the 2010 games and promote successful opening ceremonies
7378311 also were hopeful that the 2010 olympic committee will present a fantastic show to canadians and the world and opening ceremonies that will reflect canadas multicultural reality our bicultural history and our official language communities across the country and thats what were hopeful for in terms of getting a return for our investment
7378312 keep in mind this is a memo from one bureaucrat to another
7378313 it had nothing to do with myself or other ministers or the government this is a conversation between two bureaucrats and thats fine
7378314 but our goals internationally and domestically again are to present fantastic opening ceremonies that reflect canadas cultural past our cultural present and promotes canada as the greatest place in the world to live
7378315 we dont see that memo as being political it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
7378316 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
7378317 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
7378318 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
7378319 you bring all of the opinions together you accept some you reject some you modify others you come up with a program for everything
7378320 the olympics are just ending and we have seen what the chinese have built china is being led by people a generation younger than our leaders here in vancouver they may be making a lot of mistakes in china but my point is that we are getting old here in b c we need to get serious about our future and which way we are headed so much of what is being built today was envisioned a long time ago where do we go from here
7378321 one of the creative spirits of the new british columbia spreading his ideas all over the world
7378322 our civic leaders spend a lot of time talking about the current crises of the day
7378323 but i dont hear anyone talking about the big picture whats their vision for the future of the city does anybody know
7378324 the first time i heard the term vancouverism was from an italian journalist here to find out what the term meant
7378325 he said that every time he turned a corner he found something different a great deal of diversity to my mind the term refers to our way of creating density by combining residential and commercial spaces thanks to this approach we are slowly evolving into our own character downtown is pretty well built out so now we have to look at the east side
7378326 i think we need to freeze any development for now get creative and take an integrated approach to the entire area
7378327 i know this artist who bought a building over a funeral parlour in the area moved in and started an art gallery and the city permit police shut him down because he didnt fit into any category of theirs in the past we allowed commercial density to get residential housing built now i think we have to do the opposite we need to rethink the whole idea of industrial land sure we need car lots and machine shops but where should they be located
7378328 vancouver is like a teenager just approaching maturity we are a beautiful city very narcissistic we have a beautiful face but we need to grow up and we have to choose what direction we want to go
7378329 we need a lot more density than what we have now
7378330 a highrise can constitute a pleasant environment but we need more than highrises with townhouses at street level we need much more life on the streets more people people on the street bring the city alive
7378331 i think bing thom is right we need more integrated planning in the future we need to bring everything together as a whole i think he is a great visionary and we need to listen to people like him
7378332 i see vancouverism not as an individual building or style but as a work by a group of people in the 1970s at a moment in time when the community elected a city council whose mission it was to improve the quality of life in our city i refer to team or the electors action movement led by art phillips
7378333 former city councillor walter hardwick was a major architect of vancouverism
7378334 he had an understanding of complexity former mayor art phillips showed leadership and financial acumen we are desperately short of those things today we need to see the planning that is going on and discuss what it might look like when it is built
7378335 we have been successful in creating a place where people want to come to but we seem to have forgotten what sort of economic base we want to create and an understanding of an integration of all the forces that make for a successful city
7378336 there seems to be a lack of discussion and agreement about where we want to go from here as a community we need to agree on such things
7378337 yes we should be looking east it all comes together at the georgia viaduct and chinatown we need a mix of commerce and research and development and industry in that entire area
7378338 but you know it when you see it its very green and glassy it embraces density by building whole neighbourhoods of residential towers lots of thin towers on podiums it mixes old and new young and old well off and not so well off jobs and retail green spaces and hard edges its pedestrian friendly its profitable
7378339 what happened in vancouver during the 1990s has turned out to be architecturally significant and there are a lot of people coming here to see if it works for their city the fundamentals turned out to be fairly correct
7378340 but i think we should pause a moment before saying the tracks should be removed
7378341 but one thing is constant and that is the need for energy we hear people talk about the need to get freight trucks off the road and maybe use barges to move heavy freight around the region but is anything more energy efficient than rail perhaps the rail lines that terminate at the waterfront will prove to be a very important part of our infrastructure in the future just as they have in the past and we should think twice about any talk of their removal for the sake of more residential and commercial development
7378342 the urban experiment in downtown vancouver is being applied all over
7378343 the use of the automobile is now dropping in the downtown region the kids are taking skytrain in fact the city is full of young people with bright ideas for the future of the city all we need to do is listen to them
7378344 people like peter ladner and gregor robertson and aspiring city councillors need to step forward and give us their vision of the future all we ever hear about is the crisis of the day like drugs and homelessness lets discuss where the city should be headed lets see some real vision for a change
7378345 when you entered you would always see her sitting at the end of the bar on a bar stool in the corner she had this presence about her she dressed like no other she wore furs and diamonds but everybody respected her
7378346 people felt very comfortable coming in there of all races and no one was ever turned away
7378347 she would be so happy that its turned out that her legacy is to unite people
7378348 obviously it was probably 80 percent black or more but with fort carson here a lot of the soldiers were there
7378349 we never felt ill at ease or afraid to go in there as young white whippersnappers
7378350 more than being defiant she was just an extremely bright woman who was a good businesswoman who had a generous nature and a sense of justice
7378351 instead of things happening the way they did in terms of civil rights its just a very unique story that colorado springs should be excited about

7378363 he and alma welcomed a brand new ensign with open arms as if i was a person they had known for ages
7378364 if he were here today he would be crawling up on a ladder trying to take that name down because its not about him
7378365 its been our companys long standing tradition to donate food to the local food bank a couple of weeks before we open a new store in a community our new store doesnt open until november 2nd but the food bank was in need of food now so we moved quickly to make this happen
7378366 making a difference in the community is one of our most important values
7378367 its especially gratifying to help when the need is so evident
7378368 the numbers of people needing assistance with food have increased 35 percent over the last six months coupled with back to school stress on family budgets this generous donation could not have come at a better time we are excited to have wegmans coming to our community and are looking forward to a good relationship with them
7378369 buses will roll some as early as 6 a m to pick up children and take them to the countys 88 schools
7378370 about 56 000 of an estimated 73 000 students will be transported by bus
7378371 passing a stopped school bus is considered reckless driving and carries a fine of 250
7378372 most fatalities and major injuries associated with pupil transportation occur when students are struck by motorists who are attempting to pass school buses while students are being loaded or discharged
7378373 opening and closing times vary by school to better utilize the school divisions school buses and drivers
7378374 we believe the visit will be a turning point in the two countries relationship which has been primarily an economic one to expand into all areas including politics defence and culture
7378375 we have signed an agreement with iit delhi for a collaborative project over a period of one year

7378377 nanotechnology promises a fundamental improvement in the way we build our products we believe that nanotechnology will allow us to insert more capability into a smaller space with lower weight and potentially lower cost and at the same time achieve greater reliability
7378378 new coatings will provide high performance low observables for enhanced stealth of our aircraft and missiles making it more difficult for our systems to be detected by enemy forces smaller components such as miniaturised electronics will allow increased redundancy in systems that will result in greater reliability
7378379 monolayer graphene flakes a single atom thick were first isolated by andrew geims group at the university of manchester england in 2005 and have been intensely studied since then
7378380 graphenes interesting electronic effects opens a new realm of basic science its an entirely new material with new physics that could lead to new practical devices and applications in that respect its as promising as carbon nanotubes but graphenes planar geometry is potentially even more versatile
7378381 because graphene is two dimensional it can be carved up and cut into tailored shapes like cutting a sheet of paper
7378382 but to take full advantage of this new material we will need to understand what is happening at atomic length scales thats where the stm the scanning tunneling microscope comes in
7378383 the purpose of controlling the gate voltage is to vary the density of the charge carriers in the graphene
7378384 the purpose of varying the stm bias voltage is to perform spectroscopy so we can look at the graphenes local density of states at different energies we want to know where are the electrons how are they behaving
7378385 when we plotted the ldos spectra of our gated graphene flakes however we found a gap like feature that was centered on the fermi energy no matter how we changed the density of charge carriers in the graphene with the gate voltage and no matter where we looked on the flake
7378386 almost no electrons tunneling from the stm tip could enter the graphene at low energies within this gap region but at slightly higher energies there was an abrupt giant enhancement in tunneling like a floodgate opening up for electrons
7378387 there was another feature in the spectrum a local minimum of states which moved in a very regular way as we changed the gate voltage and thus the density of charge carriers in the material
7378388 we realized that this is not a true energy gap it is not a feature of the electronic band structure of graphene
7378389 rather it marks the interaction of the tunneling electrons with phonons the quantized vibrations of the graphene lattice
7378390 then each tunneling electron is able to create a phonon vibration in the graphene sheet which allows the electron to get into the graphene much easier
7378391 when a phonon is created the sigma orbital kind of rubs up against the pi orbital and acts like grease to help insert a tunneling electron into graphene
7378392 we started this research by simply asking what do you see when you measure a graphene device with stm
7378393 in the process we discovered a completely unexpected phonon floodgate this gives us new insight into how electrons and phonons behave in graphene and creates new opportunities for future graphene based nanodevice applications

7378396 china never before entered the worlds gaze in this role
7378397 the opportunity of the olympics has allowed us to calmly show a more open and self confident china after 30 years of reform and opening up
7378398 this great country still immersed in an olympics honeymoon is on an emotional high
7378399 her people have never been so optimistic and self confident so full of faith in their countrys advancement
7378400 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7378401 faced with such suspicions accusations and unfriendliness china from the state leadership level to the ordinary public did not accuse and complain

7378408 at least 68 people were killed when a boeing 737 airliner crashed and burst into flames near kyrgyzstans main airport yesterday the plane whose passengers included 17 members of a school volleyball team came down shortly after take off
7378409 when the plane caught fire one of its doors was blocked and everyone rushed to another door
7378410 there was a stampede and many of those on board will only be able to be identified using dna analysis
7378411 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden
7378412 the electoral map is due for some changes after a remarkably static red and blue divide
7378413 it is highly likely that a half dozen or more states will flip sides in 2008
7378414 there are a lot of people who are not from here and dont have the political and partisan allegiances of the folks who have lived here for years
7378415 michigan is in play for republicans because mccain is genuinely popular here
7378416 its the kind of state where he does well with sizable suburban areas with moderate republicans
7378417 these voters are not well grounded in any particular partisan allegiance
7378418 when we would come out of the icu the hallways were just lined with people there would be like 25 30 people that were spending the night
7378419 it was really just their energy their compassion just really got to me i just kept thinking about it
7378420 i thought wouldnt it be so nice to direct this energy to channel this energy that they have and thats when i thought about organizing something to help the community
7378421 its like a home away from home for us now
7378422 i think its very nice of them to come here
7378423 theyre very cheerful young men and women and its wonderful for us
7378424 its wonderful for our residents and theyve done a lot here
7378425 i want the story to be told i want people to know that things like this are happening in our neighborhoods happening to our friends and our family and just bring some awareness
7378426 its cool that were getting joes name out there and that we get to tell the story
7378427 thats what i like about it getting to tell the story and changing lives
7378428 i think its going to continue to grow as people find out who we are are and what we are do ing
7378429 but feel the potential risk is well worth the reward
7378430 hes a guy that was a high profile pitcher that we felt we could take a chance on
7378431 hes throwing the ball extremely well and his stuffs getting better and better
7378432 and he has improved a great deal from when he started to now
7378433 now that ive learned it its the best thing i have learned in baseball thats why ive been successful thats what ive been throwing right now sinkers sinkers and sinkers
7378434 it doesnt get hit hard ill tell you that much
7378435 all pitchers get hit if they make bad pitches but he consistently works down in the zone with it and the ball sinks away from bats he gets a lot of ground balls and actually a lot of swings and misses
7378436 hes a strike thrower and hes got a good feel for pitching
7378437 basically all i want to do is get quick outs
7378438 i dont care if i strike them out if i strike them out ill take it but i just want them to hit the ball and put it in play
7378439 a lot of times since he goes right after hitters he goes out there for five strong
7378440 the key is i just always come to the ballpark mentally prepared for five solid innings
7378441 we work in the bullpen all the time working on what pitches he wants to use in whatever counts
7378442 day after day he works and is doing well hes stronger and hes improv ing
7378443 the way hes pitching right now i wouldnt change anything
7378444 im looking forward to seeing him next year when he can go 100 pitches and go late in the ball game
7378445 we try to develop starters because thats the priority in baseball
7378446 were going to start him until he shows us he cant at a higher level or there is a need in the bullpen he fits
7378447 but i think hes a starter hes going to get a lot of quick outs with that power sinker i expect to see him continue to grow next year
7378448 we just thought what a good combination to have a run and a health and wellness fair
7378449 this seems to be a very popular event were going to do it again next year
7378450 its always fun to come out and do things here

7378453 its a way to share what we are passionate about
7378454 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights

7378466 ive always thought it sounded a bit unlikely but im not going to tell you it hasnt been flattering
7378467 sexual practices such as bondage sadistic and masochistic conduct and submissive dominant relationships
7378468 no no no no no no no nooooo sebelius told reporters who asked for her latest thoughts on the months long search
7378469 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7378470 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign said clinton the former first lady who came close to capturing the nomination in the primaries of last winter and spring
7378471 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7378472 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7378473 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7378474 unconventional nominee an indication that oft mentioned former pennsylvania gov
7378475 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those ques tions
7378476 and 2 do you actually pay people to write this nonsense
7378477 do you really think anything will be different if the dems
7378478 biden is someone who could step into the presidency seamlessly if the situation ever arose
7378479 your use of the word leverage is a code word for military intervention what leverage are you talking about economic leverage
7378480 must have been looking in the mirror when you called me a moron
7378481 georgia by the other hand is a democratic country an is not a threat for any means
7378482 jva amp sammyb are now advocating military action against russia where is your call for a diplomatic solution jva amp sammyb
7378483 because of iraq we look like fools and hypocrites when we complain about russia invading georgia we have no moral authority
7378484 while each flag will represent a soldier who has fallen the run is standing as one large stitch spanning the width of the nation coast to coast
7378485 we have been on the road for 72 days now and we have been greeted wonderfully all along the way
7378486 from schools creating our signcards to vfws maintaining our markers to runners to our sponsors there have been hundreds participating in our run
7378487 this is one of the craziest and improbable things i have ever heard of im really proud of erin and all the runners the run is for a great cause honoring all the fallen servicemen and women killed in iraq and afghanistan
7378488 the run is firmly non political and non religious just members of a group of clearys former classmates at hamilton college
7378489 we want to raise awareness about the lives of those soldiers who fought to activate their memories and keep their spirits alive to support organizations that help wounded veterans and families of those killed and to aid the healing process for those americans whose lives have been affected by the war
7378490 it could be a setup where an account and check are real but the scheme is fraudulent
7378491 one thing we tell our customers is that if its too good to be true its probably not
7378492 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility
7378493 dont let the door smack you on the butt on your way out
7378494 the requested sewer connection was substantially inconsistent with the comprehensive plan
7378495 by denying the right to connect to sewer therefore the board has taken all economically viable use of the property and must compensate the guels for this taking
7378496 if this case were to go to trial we would present evidence that as a result of the boards action the property was either rendered valueless or severely diminished from its value of at least 520 600 as a buildable lot
7378497 theyve had two chances to give their side theyve had two bites of the apple already
7378498 theyve already been given their opportunity to make their request and theres no indication i have that the board would change position
7378499 every time you make an exception to the rule you are potentially setting a precedent and allowing for the additional and larger development into the rural crescent
7378500 the board has been consistent in protecting the rural crescent with very very few exceptions and were confident and the county attorney is confident were clearly doing the right thing
7378501 the board is not going to allow for the willowing away of the rural crescent
7378502 the only way we know something is awry is when the helicopter is circling around
7378503 our last escape was in 1983 so weve had a good track record

7378511 help me get out and vote for me i know how the system works

7378515 did you see those pictures of madonna in the paper
7378516 she looks awful shes too old to wear such sexy clothes she should dress her age
7378517 this is a widely held opinion about madonna that she makes up for a lack of ability and of natural beauty through sheer determination tireless self promotion and physical reinvention two years ago i am of the opinion shared by many that madonna can neither dance nor sing
7378518 the breezy superficiality of stylish effervescent beats and hook rich melodies are given depth by her personal charisma and confident visceral sometimes carnal vocals
7378519 mane event a benefit for amaryllis farm equine rescue the poster madonna to chair amaryllis farm equine rescue benefit on august 9 magazine from france madonna live at the stade de france on september 26 madonna set to top u

7378522 she can still shake it like shes a 20 year old
7378523 she was late and she didnt even thank the people
7378524 madonna entered the stage on a throne on saturday as she kicked off her world tour and defied her age with athletic dance routines before tens of thousands of screaming fans
7378525 i think after the auckland game we talked about how our lineout had been going for the past 12 months prior rather than that one game
7378526 you dont become a bad lineout overnight or a good lineout over night
7378527 we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7378528 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on
7378529 it took off the pursuing police pulled out of the chase due to the speed it was doing it was doing at least 140kph and it had just started to rain
7378530 it had the potential to be a lot messier than it was thats for sure
7378531 got a bit exuberant about the numbers were not going to impose costs like 50 a week on motorists
7378532 you get to choose the balance and theres no way that we are going to be imposing a 50 cost on motorists i think the level of tolling that the governments talking about on puhoi a motorway extention north of auckland which is about 2 is more reasonable
7378533 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices
7378534 while nationals ability to issue policies only to have to issue corrections and clarifications of those policies within 24 hours is a source of amusement it is also alarming that a major political party is unwilling to be clear about its real agenda
7378535 so youre probably talking about 20 per cent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 per cent
7378536 im completely american i was born and raised in america and i love it but i think we are too quick to censor nudity
7378537 meanwhile its okay to blow things up and our films are so violent and our television is so violent
7378538 i would rather see tasteful nudity than violence any day of the week
7378539 okay so its blood flavored corn syrup lets do this

7378541 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7378542 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7378543 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7378544 the companys claim that they cannot afford to settle the dispute is not credible since they are owned by 40 major financial institution worth billions of pounds
7378545 well go there to wrap up qualification to the group stage aware that well have to put in the same determination we put in during the first leg in turin
7378546 well be faced with opposition who dearly want to put on a good show in front of their fans
7378547 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7378548 we have a big game on wednesday night and we have to respond with a top class performance because was we did today saturday was just not good enough

7378550 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7378551 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7378552 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7378553 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7378554 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7378555 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7378556 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7378557 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7378558 im not asking you im telling you please retire so we dont have to move away from here
7378559 im delighted by the range of innovative projects from across the university illustrating there are many possible approaches to embedding employability in degree programmes
7378560 the number of projects submitted indicates that academics see employability as a valuable integral part of the student experience
7378561 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7378562 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7378563 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7378564 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7378565 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7378566 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7378567 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7378568 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7378569 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
7378570 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
7378571 being affordable and accessible always rank alongside offering a high quality education as prime factors in everything we do to enhance the college experience for the young men and women who choose to come to texas a amp m
7378572 obviously were disappointed in the overall ranking given that we firmly believe texas a amp m is one of the great universities in the united states but this serves as a wake up call that we will need to embrace bold aggressive initiatives in order to meet our vision 2020 aspirations of being ranked among the top 10 public institutions nationwide
7378573 the excellence of a great research university filled with many traditions and the warm hospitality of a safe small town

7378581 thats the difference between major league hitters whove established themselves and other guys hannahan said the guys who are established stay consistent all year they eliminate those ups and downs
7378582 i know his numbers are not where they need to be but it takes time to take your swing adjustments into a game but hes starting to do that and i think youre gonna start to see some good things
7378583 my goal is just to be ready when that bullpen phone rings
7378584 weve got guys down there we can filter in and out from the sixth inning on i try to treat every inning the same
7378585 i just feel like if brad is available ill use him but if hes not well see what the options are i dont feel like were in the business to give guys chances to do things were still trying to win as many games as we can
7378586 im gonna go find curt right now and go over hitters
7378587 it was very intimate and both guy and madonna made vows to each other and pledged to try to make their marriage strong again the ceremony lasted about an hour they turned up at the kabbalah centre in their gym clothes and changed into white robes everyone at the centre hopes that they will get through their recent rough patch
7378588 we arent jumping like we usually do we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7378589 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives no one really cared about clay aiken becoming a single dad either
7378590 foi uma emo o muito grande fiquei nervoso porque embora tenha cantado bossa nova no in cio da minha carreira j faz muito tempo a gente n o se sente tanto nessa praia
7378591 e ao lado de caetano ent o fiquei mais nervoso ainda
7378592 n o o roberto canta muito mais que eu n o confete n o constata o da realidade para mim foi uma maravilha
7378593 a bossa nova uma m sica riqu ssima sofisticada e que transcendeu
7378594 o movimento criou uma esp cie de auto estima musical nacional
7378595 come a que tem o ensinamento de jo o gilberto que o ensinamento est tico do estilo dele daquela concis o intelig ncia musical isso me norteou sempre
7378596 agora o grande g nio da composi o do arranjo o grande m sico daquele momento o tom jobim talvez o maior compositor brasileiro de todos os tempos

7378598 the mathematical constant which represents the ratio of any circles circumference to its diameter in geometry which is the same as the ratio of a circles area to the square of its radius it is approximately equal to 3 14159
7378599 in the past weve said a bit naively that if we cater for the needs of plants well just cross our fingers and hope that the needs of animals have been met as well
7378600 we need to be much more refined in our use of fire
7378601 theres a fundamental difference between plants and animals that people often overlook
7378602 for a plant it may not matter diddlysquat whether its part of one hectare thats burnt or 10 000 hectares that are burnt
7378603 some may be really helpful to animals some may be detrimental
7378604 if were politically committed to that task we need to be also politically committed to monitoring the impact
7378605 we had a balk a wild pitch a homer errant throws walk off home run
7378606 we played for the cycle both teams across the board
7378607 i tried to get on base for matty i got a pretty good pitch to hit took a hack at it
7378608 it felt good right away it was an unbelievable feeling
7378609 that was very appropriate that that happened for him today because he does his work so professionally
7378610 whatever you ask him to do he does it and he does such a good job when hes out there
7378611 i wanted a sinker down and away and it ended up down and in on him
7378612 he is seeing the ball well he is taking bad pitches and not missing good pitches he is hitting it hard really hard
7378613 he is a calm guy a pretty determined rookie and probably competes as well as anybody every pitch
7378614 i know but he doesnt know what he likes hes too young to know that whats in the long run is best for him
7378615 i have to give it to him he has been working hard
7378616 if you can get that into them young and they have success with it you dont have to worry about instilling that in them in the future once they get it young they get it and they have it most guys dont get it until they get older especially if they have success without working hard
7378617 he bunted on his own and we didnt put it on
7378618 i talked to him about it explained it told him i said youre the hottest hitter on this team right now and we wanted you to hit away dont think for yourself well help you hey its part of learning
7378619 he came in between innings and said he was developing some stiffness and soreness in the back of his elbow
7378620 thats right where the triceps tendon comes into the elbow johnny being as young as he is at this point of the season logging as many innings as he has 155 we want to err on the side of caution take no chances
7378621 cordero had to leave and go home due to a personal matter
7378622 we gave em the first three runs on errors and didnt get a hit after the sixth inning
7378623 doing that and making five errors seasons high makes it awfully hard to win a game
7378624 our rallies have attracted hundreds of thousands of people in the past nearly 15 days which were all peaceful
7378625 es de gente com n y corriente a trav s de todo puerto rico que han entendido que esto es un acto de injusticia y han querido aportar para que se pueda tener una defensa legal adecuada porque todos sabemos que fiscal a federal tiene recursos ilimitados

7378641 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7378642 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7378643 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7378644 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7378645 its such a honour to be able to represent canada three times at the games
7378646 all three of them have been so special in their own way
7378647 so carrying the flag its just a great way to end these olympics
7378648 with the time constraint it was tough to be back and get ready and in shape for these games
7378649 after my event i was still in disbelief because its been such a hard year for me to come back from an injury
7378650 i didnt even think i would be here thats something i take great pride in thats something that has made me a stronger person
7378651 i felt like i was representing all the trampoliners before me that didnt have the opportunity for the olympics athens was special because it was where the olympics started and all the history there
7378652 here this one meant so much because of the journey i had to go through this year coming back from injury that will be with me for a long time
7378653 you dont really have the feeling of falling youre jumping its very different
7378654 i dont know why im scared of heights ive been like that for a long time it is kind of funny i do trampoline i jump 20 feet in the air but to me its really different
7378655 i think its going to be great at the grassroots level for all the young children in china
7378656 you can tell how much the chinese have enjoyed having the games
7378657 i think it will help them keep excelling and be one of the top countries in sport

7378659 apabila menjadi ketua menteri pulau pinang adalah menjadi tanggungjawab memakai songkok dalam beberapa acara rasmi dan saya pakai tanpa keraguan
7378660 saya langsung tidak kekok kerana pakaian itu adalah penghormatan kepada budaya dan tugas diamanahkan
7378661 semua pihak tidak perlu bimbang dengan tindakan saya itu bagi saya ia bukan isu besar kita ambil yang baik apa salahnya
7378662 apa yang penting tindakan yang diambil itu tiada paksaan dan dibuat atas kerelaan sendiri
7378663 bukannya jika pergi ke masjid maknanya saya menjadi seorang islam semua agama mengajar kebaikan dan tidak salah jika kita mengambil tindakan dengan mengunjungi rumah ibadat terbabit apabila dijemput
7378664 liberal leader stephane dion believes prime minister stephen harper could be dissuaded from calling a federal election in the next few weeks
7378665 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the byelections
7378666 a few days ago he just called a fourth byelection in don valley west its taxpayers money
7378667 dion repeated his earlier claims that harper wants to bypass parliamentary committee hearings into tory scandals and distract canadians from a weakening economy he also said harper would be breaking his promise of fixed election dates every four years
7378668 the canadian corporate giants dominating alberta oil sands extraction and refining lobbied the federal government intensively this summer federal records show the campaign began shortly after liberal leader stephane dion unveiled his plan for 15 billion worth of new taxes on carbon emissions and continued through july oil and gas lobbyists held several meetings with industry minister jim prentice and natural resources minister gary lunn one meeting with environment minister john baird and a string of meetings with top government officials including aides to prime minister stephen harper the liberal tax plan feared in western canada was likely discussed an industry source said but the lobbying also reflected industry concern over the conservative governments plan to use the criminal code under the authority of environmental protection law to enforce its own greenhouse gas reduction plan the source added records show the companies that engaged in the lobbying were shell canada petro canada suncor imperial oil chevron canada encana corp conocophillips and nexen inc three major industry organizations the canadian association of petroleum producers another group representing small producers and explorers and a third representing firms that market and distribute petroleum products also took part in the campaign

7378671 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7378672 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7378673 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7378674 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7378675 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7378676 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7378677 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7378678 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7378679 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7378687 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7378688 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7378689 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7378690 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7378691 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7378692 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7378704 we think this conditionality that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments the regular attendance at school by their kids is a necessary precondition is the right way to go
7378705 we need in order to compete with the rest of the world to boost our current school retention rate from 75 per cent to 90 per cent by 2020 but we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well
7378706 i mean it has a dreadful effect on children if they are only intermittently in school
7378707 all the research from around the world would tell us that if kids dont get a decent education then that is setting them up for a lifetime of failure we want to break that cycle
7378708 why punish the kids for their parents mistakes when you dont punish job seekers or so called job seekers who dont have a work ethic
7378709 now i really think kevin rudds got to be consistent on this and at the moment what were seeing i think are just populist gestures from a prime minister whos all spin and no substance
7378710 is there anybody around in the morning to help the child get to school
7378711 if there isnt and if the family for whatever reason is in a high degree of chaos then its unlikely that turning off the income tap to a degree for 12 weeks is going to make any difference in that regard
7378712 as far as were aware in the community sector there isnt really any evidence either in australia or from overseas that involuntary income management actually works on any dimension
7378713 its difficult to see how it is going to address the causes of the crisis and chaos in family lives that result in this kind of experience for children
7378714 so if theres an issue with the parenting lets wrap some parenting support programs around if theres alcohol other drugs violence if those things are an issue in the familys life in the adults life then lets try and go to the core of those issues
7378715 with all of these programs there is a strong evidence base for and we know they actually work we know they get results
7378716 the problem is out there in the community particularly in areas that are locationally disadvantaged is that those programs are simply not available to people
7378717 we had a limited number of arrests for minor infractions with dnc
7378718 he is that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids iowa and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw veterans hall in concord new hampshire and at the center of an international crisis
7378719 he also has the courage the courage to make this a better place
7378720 and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7378721 he has to establish that he is a plausible commander in chief
7378722 many voters think he is but some have their doubts or simply dont know very much about him in that regard
7378723 it shows that barack obama is someone who is prepared to bring into his administration talented people from all walks of life who are able to help him move forward
7378724 but it will be clear that he is the president
7378725 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth the truth hurt and obama didnt like it
7378726 i think if you talk to people in denver this week you are not going to see a lot of a funk disappointment
7378727 what you are going to see are a lot of people who know that we cant have four more years of these policies
7378728 i doubt he would give a shit since i havent seen him since i was 2 years old
7378729 you arent going to find his replacement at this party

7378743 it was very intimate and both guy and madonna made vows to each other and pledged to try to make their marriage strong again the ceremony lasted about an hour they turned up at the kabbalah centre in their gym clothes and changed into white robes everyone at the centre hopes that they will get through their recent rough patch
7378744 we arent jumping like we usually do we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky

7378746 weve seen two things happen the aussie dollar is still strong relative to where its been in the past
7378747 whenever we talk to people travelling even 88 cents or 66 cents is still better than the 50 cents it was a number of years back
7378748 the appeal of travellers cheques is that people can lock in the cash rate so regardless of movements in the economy and when trips are taken the value of travellers cheques is retained
7378749 we are still seeing good growth on the travellers cheque product
7378750 the number of times the only thing a customer has to cling to is to ring an american express hotline and you know be saved when theyve lost their travel money
7378751 i will not have gangs of trippers starting off in charabancs from in front of our offices the way they do from travel agent thomas cooks
7378752 we will cash their travellers checks sic and give them free advice thats all
7378753 i try not to use credit cards but theres extra you pay on the cards
7378754 i carry travellers cheques in the suitcase ive been doing this for 30 plus years
7378755 ive never had any trouble with them ever i can always cash them when i want to cash them
7378756 i think i had about a 3 000 in travellers cheques
7378757 i covered all bases i brought some cash and a credit card
7378758 it was there in case i fell off a ledge
7378759 they were useful but less so in nepal where they took my passport
7378760 one bank they said no no no money unless you give me your passport they photocopied it
7378761 i didnt go back there twice thats not how it worked in china
7378762 we cant dictate what the banks do at the other end
7378763 its a very rare case where banks specifically give the customer any particular issues

7378769 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7378770 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7378787 sorry my mom had to stop the car and wait for her orgasms to finish
7378788 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
7378789 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
7378790 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace

7378795 the fact that no one voted for him was because no one heard of him

7378797 he who pays the piper gets to call the tune
7378798 the video shows a chart comparing the mainstream media coverage to the internet coverage
7378799 the odds are great the odds are difficult and i know that but i would say that what has happened so far is about 100 times greater than i anticipated and we dont know the future
7378800 george stephanopoulos has long lost credibility as a journalist as far as im concerned its not the job of a journalist to so rudely interject such personal points of view im not even a republican and i think ron paul shouldve been given the benefit of a more professional interview george has always been a fake and now hes also an unprofessional bully maybe he should run for office in the republican party
7378801 i enjoyed the opportunity to hear dr paul speak almost every word that he speaks is consistent and makes sense i may not agree with him but he clearly has principles and speaks honestly his contributions to society as a member of the military a physician a politician and a father deserve respect when jerry springer prods with sensationalist questions it is not suprising or unexpected when george stephanopoulos who claims to be a serious journalist tells dr paul he has no chance of winning and would bet every cent he has to that effect he lowers the political discourse of this nation to the paris hilton jerry springer level it is a terrible thing that given an extremely well read thoughtful politician who could speak for hours on any number of issues mr stephanopoulos uses the time to jibe and demean dr paul i acknowledge that dr paul must have the capacity to brush past this type of treatment to win the election and that no heinous wrong was committed it shows mr stephanopoulos and the producers have no great commitment to debate and free thought i will not watch this program again
7378802 i am a christian and as a member of the christian community im afraid we are losing control of the media

7378806 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7378807 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7378808 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
7378809 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
7378810 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
7378811 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7378812 were making javascript disappear as far as performance is concerned
7378813 one example is to use the browser as a very simple photoshop
7378814 editing an image requires things that for each step takes the better part of a second thats not a great user experience but with tracemonkey now you have something that comes close to interactive performance
7378815 we are planning for it to be there in firefox 3 1
7378816 it wont have all the capabilities theres more than a couple of months of work left but we are targeting 3 1
7378817 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7378818 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs
7378819 theres no theoretical reason why it cant be as sharp and approach native code speeds in two to four years
7378820 people within the sports ministry think the status quo is great and they will point to the gold medals as proof they are right
7378821 the medals are the upside and the downside is the cost to the 400 million children 20 and under who dont get much of a chance to play scholastic or extracurricular sports because the system is geared only towards raising elite athletes who can win medals
7378822 as china modernizes why wouldnt you want its sports system to catch up with western countries the same way so many other aspects of chinese life have
7378823 theres tremendous pride and passion about the medals but changing the system is not a bad thing
7378824 we have weightlifting on the county and provincial level as well as national
7378825 we are always looking for promising athletes and the central government not only pay attention to the professional athletes but also to the competitors at a grassroots level
7378826 as a general theory many people agree that the system needs to be reformed but from which angle to what degree and in how long a time span are all still being debated
7378827 im sure that the olympics achievements of team china will be an interesting reference point for all camps in the debate
7378828 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it
7378829 these are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex they are building more and more into their operating systems and with that comes more complexity and more challenges but what i think is most important here is the response
7378830 at this time we are confident there is little risk to fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed fedora packages
7378831 may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
7378832 zaq if your mighty god could just show himself to me i would believe
7378833 if there was no heaven would you still be a christian
7378834 if i saw a talking ass zaq i would believe
7378835 well that is some cool stuff but what about the big stuff why doesnt god just perform some huge miracle and shut up his skeptics
7378836 more amazing is his refusal to perform and to overwhelm gods terrible insistence on human freedom is so absolute that he granted us the power to live as though he did not exist to spit in his face to crucify him i believe god insists on such restraint because no pyrotechnic displays of omnipotence will achieve the response he desires although power can force obedience only love can summon a response of love which is the one thing god wants from us and the reason he created us
7378837 there are a couple of precursors to us making the offer
7378838 one is we want to make the offer in the native language of the build that youre running and were having text localized and translated now
7378839 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week
7378840 were pretty committed to user choice but were also pretty ardent that firefox 3 0 is a good product
7378841 you can decline the update when its offered if you dont want it
7378842 well start and make sure the mirror network is not overloaded
7378843 one thing we heard from users was whether there was a problem with firefox 2 0
7378844 theres been a good buzz around it and for people who have gotten firefox 2 0 its been a while since theyve had a major update

7378847 htc would not release a smartphone in this day and age that lacked bluetooth support
7378848 those are the most prevalent but if you have a product catalog you need to ensure product descriptions are correct and that the price makes sense
7378849 were feeling confident that the cost wont go above that
7378850 the first half was tough we lacked energy and we were not attacking
7378851 we went down 1 0 and we had to play catch up which uses up a lot of energy
7378852 we werent winning 50 50 balls and lacked plays in the midfield
7378853 the second half we came out and made some things happen
7378854 we got a nice goal and started to pick up the pace
7378855 we let our guard down and ultimately we used up a lot of energy having to play catch up

7378859 23 5 million employed americans teleworked at least one day per month in 2003 this number rose to 24 1 in 2004 this number is expected to rise to 40 million by 2010
7378860 23 of american workers and 41 of small business owners regularly work from home or another offsite location relying on web technology e g the internet e mail or programs that allow them to remotely access their office computers or meet with colleagues online
7378861 of those who currently do not have the ability to do their jobs off site 62 agreed they would like to be able to do so
7378862 if you want to waste an hour of your day stop by the office for 5 minutes
7378863 more and more vendors are introducing cloud platforms and software as a service saas offerings to bring people together online the purpose of these collaborative software systems is to mimic the work environment that we had since the first organized office
7378864 space collective org is a cross media information and entertainment channel for post ideological non partisan forward thinking terrestrials
7378865 the web has a particular architecture and it makes sense that if you are deploying a service or api on the web then it should take advantage of this architecture instead of fighting against it there are millions of deployed clients servers and intermediaries that support rest and it makes sense to be compatible with their expectations
7378866 apple would gain nothing from telegraphing its intentions and capabilities by releasing public conceptual products the company is being more than prudent by not displaying their unconstrained fantasies to competitors media investors or customers
7378867 it was a good pick a lot of people like joe biden for his knowledge of foreign policy and his years of experience in the senate he comes from a middle class background a lot of people are very excited about biden
7378868 says theres a strong movement further to the left with two strong liberals now and the country is more center right where did the idea of change go where did it go now with this choice it is politics as usual with one of the most liberal senators out of washington
7378869 i dont think its really going to help or hurt i think its all about obama right now hes the man for change
7378870 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7378871 you finally mowed the lawn after six months you sloth

7378874 hes been pretty much guaranteed that if he gets through all fitness checks all health regulations and does everything right that he needs to do then he will be signed at collingwood next season
7378875 we dont want to comment on that sort of bulls t go talk to karl langdon we have no comment
7378876 ben still has to get his body right and until he gets not only the football side of things but other things back on track then he wont be going anywhere
7378877 im not really interested in any clubs contacting me at the moment to be honest
7378878 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7378879 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7378880 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7378881 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7378882 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7378883 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7378884 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7378885 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7378886 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7378887 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle
7378888 if obama becomes the president every remaining powerfully felt black grievance and every still deeply etched injustice will be cast out of the realm of polite discourse
7378889 our concern is that well get lost in the shuffle
7378890 people feel that theres something callous something racially indifferent in saying wait a minute weve come a long way
7378891 apparently yung berg ran into rapper trick trick in a detroit club according to one mediatakeout com spy words were exchanged between yung berg and trick trick and a few seconds later a bloody and bruised yung berg was being carried out of the club chainless
7378892 the history making nominations aside all the rhetoric from all the speakers at next weeks democratic convention will be so much hot air above the rockies unless the party comes to grip with how people are living and hurting today

7378896 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7378897 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7378898 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7378899 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
7378900 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
7378901 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
7378902 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
7378903 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
7378904 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
7378905 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
7378906 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
7378907 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
7378908 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7378909 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7378910 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7378911 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
7378912 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
7378913 we wont toll on existing road space we wont put in place a london style congestion levy
7378914 the departments would not do the work unless the government has an intention of introducing these new tolls and taxes
7378915 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7378916 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7378917 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7378918 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7378919 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7378920 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7378921 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7378922 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7378923 i hope it will come as no surprise that i have something to say
7378924 the vice president doesnt matter so why would the first lady candidate matter honestly voters vote for one person and it is the candidate
7378925 you cannot separate the overall impression of a candidate from their spouse any more than you could separate a candidate from his regional accent or his age or the color of his skin the membership of his political party
7378926 it is one of the few indicators that people can universally look at and think about which they can also relate to
7378927 it works at the margins but in close elections margins can be really important
7378928 look at the whole picture and the wives are very much a key component of that picture
7378929 to talk about the values she and barack hold to educate people more about them and about barack to animate him
7378930 when a spouse talks about her spouse theres an authenticity to it
7378931 the spouses really create balance for these candidates on the road
7378932 i think that michelle is seen quite favorably by voters right now
7378933 theres no evidence that we want a woman who is cutting edge
7378934 she would first of all be a mother and a wife
7378935 sometimes the weaker storms that move very very slowly can be your biggest rainfall makers
7378936 it could have been a heck of a lot worse
7378937 we knew it was going to flood but we didnt know it was going to be this bad it was above my knees
7378938 i was just putting towels and comforters down to keep it out of the house but it kept coming
7378939 i said im not going to cry because if i start i wont stop
7378940 the apostle paul and the introspective conscience of the west
7378941 cults and cosmic consciousness religious vision in the american 1960s
7378942 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7378943 nicks proofreading prowess turns him into a firm superstar if only it mattered in the real world
7378944 its the quickest way to superstardom around here elliot trokey found three typos in a proxy statement and got assigned to the cook merger the next day
7378945 mccains campaign is cheapening his greatest strength and making a mockery of his already dubious claim that hes reticent to talk about his pow experience by flashing the pow card to rebut any criticism no matter how unrelated
7378946 john mccain will have trouble deciding which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7378947 be wise in the way you act toward outsiders make the most of every opportunity let your conversation be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone
7378948 i t would greatly help the democratic ticket if they deigned to educate hillarys bitter enders on the facts of life
7378949 at times i think some people sought for me to make every play
7378950 i was one of 11 out there but when much is expected then those type of words and feelings come with it and youre held to a higher standard i understand that i took the accolades so at the same time i have to take the criticisms
7378951 a lot of times when a guy gets a change of scenery its a fresh start and he has something to prove to everybody ive heard the knock on him but the thing i have to go by is what i see here on the field
7378952 since hes been here with us his attitude has been good hes helping the younger players playing the defense the way we want it and hes giving good effort and i think if we are cognizant of the fact that he might not be able to play 100 plays in a game and needs a breather we can get somebody else out there so he can catch his breath then still get good production out of him
7378953 ive had a long career as far as snaps go
7378954 ive had several seasons over 1 000 snaps being in those trenches that wears on you theres nothing wrong with a rotation theres no need for me to be out there playing on a half tank when theres more than one qualified guy next to me capable of handling some of the snaps
7378955 if they want to talk about it then ill talk about it if not theres no need for me to discuss it
7378956 in a 4 3 it allowed me to be more aggressive
7378957 its a big change from playing a tilt cock nose with an attacking pass rush style to playing a zero technique with a lot more man reading and pre snap reads thats been a transition for me
7378958 theyre detroit fans and if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7378959 its expected but i dont play for the lions anymore i play for the browns maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7378960 its hard to understand how it works because last year there wasnt as much movement
7378961 theres a lot more turnover although its exciting for the playoffs it also restructures how we look at the overall season so now the regular season has a lot less meaning
7378962 if its going to be the playoffs i think its a lot more fun to have the volatility
7378963 but maybe the big swings early on maybe make it not quite so severe it might be more pleasing to everybody but im pretty happy with it so far
7378964 the way the points are set up now you set yourself up for the playoffs during the regular season just like any sport and once the playoffs start you have to perform
7378965 but i dont see how anyone can come up with a perfect system someone will get the bad end of the deal
7378966 i had the lead twice and i gave it up both times leaving two balls over the plate a game like sundays with the importance of the game you cant allow that to happen our guys fought back and played a heck of a game theyve been picking me up the past two weeks and i didnt pick them up sunday we needed this one and i didnt come through
7378967 when he was pitching to crisp and cora i thought he threw his second best pitch a lot of times his curveball
7378968 he got himself into trouble with his curveball a little bit instead of throwing his best pitch which is his fastball
7378969 the ball beat him home and 95 per cent or 100 per cent of the time theyre going to call him out
7378970 it did barely beat him there but it beat him
7378971 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7378972 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7378973 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7378974 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7378975 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7378976 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7378977 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7378978 i think the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7378979 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7378980 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7378981 it wasnt where my ball was but like about five or six feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7378982 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7378983 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7378984 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7378985 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7378986 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7378987 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7378988 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7378989 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7378990 but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7378991 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7378992 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7378993 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7378994 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7378995 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7378996 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7378997 a s an englishman im not an expert in all the intricate details of american politics but as an artist i understand how rare it is to inspire a connection to a bigger idea or purpose this video isnt so much an endorsement of barack obama as much as it is a celebration of all those who have picked up a sign who have registered to vote and are working to make the world a better place so as senator barack obama ascends to the mountain top let us not forget all of the others who for the past 40 years have sung anthems of change to make this moment possible
7378998 this video isnt so much an endorsement of barack obama as much as it is a celebration of all those who have picked up a sign who have registered to vote and are working to make the world a better place
7378999 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7379000 it was not a nice weekend but it is not the first time
7379001 we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7379002 my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7379003 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for all the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7379004 to come here to a new track we did a fantastic job it was really difficult to choose the right tires especially in qualifying but we did a perfect job in that and then making the pole position winning the race and making the fast lap i think it is nothing more we can ask for
7379005 weve had quite a strong weekend nice new circuit got some good points heikki kovalainen and the team got some good points it was just overall a solid weekend for us
7379006 it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refueling we need to look and see what really happened
7379007 we still have to work very hard because today we had other problems with kimi and another one in the garage but our mechanic is fine
7379008 the magnitude of the improvement has been a little bit of a surprise
7379009 theyve broken through in some sports that we thought it would be very hard for them to win medals in but we consider this one of our most successful olympic games ever
7379010 the team will surpass the total medal count in athens
7379011 we know some nations devoted significantly more resources in these games
7379012 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7379013 arpaios racist and divisive policies are not welcome in pima county
7379014 to promote a book filled with lies fear and ignorant perspectives about immigrants was especially appalling to us
7379015 as justice canoodles with his garcia doll he voices her responses in a shrill faux chicano accent
7379016 welcome to the hypocrisy as isabels garcias sic group derechos humanos has launched a campaign against me
7379017 to contact these businesses to let them know that you are concerned about their support of hate radio and encourage them to promote their businesses with media outlets that stand behind the principles of dignity and respect
7379018 thank you for the invitation ill pass on the opportunity
7379019 despite what may have been written the story was never about me apart from the fact that i put up for viewing the video of the protest that the local media didnt show
7379020 weve been facing down the forces of hate for years
7379021 but it has never been like this before until jon justice and hate radio 104 1 fm came around and began making derogatory comments and using hateful language while regularly fomenting lies fear and misinformation about immigrants
7379022 im privileged im a citizen well educated an attorney the situation of many migrants is actually far more dangerous than the one im now facing
7379023 they are trying to silence any voice that speaks out on behalf of immigrants
7379024 they say that she was using children to incite violence against law enforcement weve never had violence at our events and always coordinate with the police and that she is a mexican agent and all of the other reconquista crap that many have heard before that we are here to for aztlan as mexican agents the problem is a fair number of people are buying into this spin and it is obviously an orchestrated attempt by the right wing to chill any resistance to racism and xenophobia that is going on here
7379025 would usually shrug this off as idiotic but it has actually gained traction this right wing jerk whose show is a constant stream of anti immigrant racist and homophobic rhetoric is leading the charge even commenting the other day that we need bloodshed in the polling places
7379026 nobody outside of arizona knows what is going on and the madness continues
7379027 i dont know what else to do except to reach out to outside allies and media to see what is going on nobody cares about the abuses and deaths that are happening in maricopa county nobody cares about the hundreds of bodies recovered on the border every year and nobody cares about the witch hunt that is taking place against isabel garcia she has been the voice of resistance for many years here and this is a strategic attempt to take her down a warning to anyone who challenges the likes of arpaio and his goon squad
7379028 will make the shootout at the ok corral look like a sunday school picnic
7379029 ive brought him to police attention several times in the past after all ive been called a traitor accused of sedition and of working for a foreign government what if someone hears this kind of talk and decides to act on it
7379030 people trafficking is a serious crime and a collaborative approach is needed to fight it
7379031 there is no reliable data there has been no sound research on the actual dimension of trafficking
7379032 since 2004 there has been a set of visas in place for people who are identified as being trafficked to australia and these visas are for people who are assisting the police and prosecution in an investigation and a criminal trial
7379033 a lot of our work has been around the area of visas and we have seen that there are people who have been trafficked theres no doubt about the trafficking experience theres no doubt about the credibility of information but they are not yet eligible for protection through the trafficking visa scheme just because they cant for a whole range of reasons take part in a criminal investigation or a prosecution
7379034 it is clear that there are trafficked people working in other industries as well
7379035 the whole area of general labour exploitation is an area that is unexplored and we have seen some people working in agriculture who are in a very extreme situation of labour exploitation
7379036 we think that if we can alert people to the reality of trafficking if we can talk about how to identify trafficking to the community at large then its more likely that trafficked people will be identified and protected
7379037 i think that these kinds of strategies will go a long way towards eliminating trafficking in australia

7379043 he was pumped up all day he was just pacing
7379044 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7379045 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7379046 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7379047 was chatting with him davis that late autumn afternoon as dunham and barry obama approached
7379048 its possible he briefly went back to indonesia before actually starting at the school
7379049 frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7379050 bridges of course always denied party membership and attempts were made to deport him because he was a communist he was born in australia but he was able to fight back because he had very very sharp shyster lawyers and a lot of friends in the u s government that helped him and they prevented his deportation but he had been a major force promoting communism
7379051 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
7379052 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
7379053 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
7379054 left himself some wiggle room not least i suppose because of the possibility of prosecution

7379069 im puzzled why many press reports about joe biden touting his foreign policy expertise and using as example the plan he supported to divide iraq into three ethnic enclaves
7379070 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7379071 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time

7379075 but she isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7379076 i just want to say i am absolutely thrilled to have joe biden as my vice president
7379077 the conversations weve been having the last couple of days make me absolutely convinced he is the right man for the job
7379078 hes got the passion the wisdom of middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots hes got the expertise to make him a great counselor in any international crises that may come up
7379079 more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure after the disastrous economic and foreign policy that have characterized the last eight years
7379080 is not your standard washington fare this is a person who challenges the status quo

7379090 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts the
7379091 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7379092 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7 300 a year
7379093 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy mr lawrence said
7379094 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7379095 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement a telstra spokesman said
7379096 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7379097 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance

7379122 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget he said
7379123 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7379124 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers thats what it comes down to leader bob brown told abc radio
7379125 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7379126 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati he told abc radio
7379127 we had the last three years with the howard government in full control ramming through its work choices industrial relations legislation the sale of telstra and so on and they lost office over it he said
7379128 im sure hes keeping a very cool head hes always good in a crisis professionally and personally
7379129 what we have is a range of companies who are out there and telstra is just one of them who are operating as if the federal election had never happened and still essentially have a mentality which is still a workchoices mentality
7379130 i think what we need in australia is a new approach
7379131 we have promised with any staff collective agreement that well preserve entitlements that are important to our current employees
7379132 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7379133 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7379134 hybrids instruments after rejecting proposals for new equity because the offers didnt provide an
7379135 while the asset sale program will provide the group with liquidity and some level of debt reduction the group considers that asset sales alone will not provide a long term recapitalisation solution centro said in a statement to investors
7379136 the group has also received and evaluated a number of proposals for new equity
7379137 we have weathered the storm in financial markets the likes of which we have never seen before
7379138 its just unfortunate i guess that this sort of momentous occasion i guess should happen on the same day that our colleague is to have his memorial service
7379139 i guess the joy i suppose is tempered a little bit by the fact that were all very very deeply feeling for ben
7379140 whether there is any omen in it or whatever that should happen on the same day as his memorial service i know thats what ben would want for everything to be getting on and happening again
7379141 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7379142 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7379143 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7379144 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7379145 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7379146 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7379147 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7379148 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7379149 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7379150 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7379151 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7379152 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7379153 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7379154 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7379155 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7379156 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7379157 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7379158 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7379159 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7379160 while we do not condone mr romeros method the u s government supports his underlying message that calls for greater freedoms in china
7379161 mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography so he created the cancer scenario
7379162 we fully understand the questions shock disbelief and even anger you may feel but michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help
7379163 we will gladly pay it back if people want their money back absolutely we are glad to make restitution
7379164 as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often break down i would report the cause of my symptoms simply as illnesses but the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but again used a mis diagnosis to hide the lie that i was living
7379165 michael was a man he sinned and he needs to be forgiven
7379166 everybody is a sinner and weve all been forgiven by god
7379167 ive always been inspired by this period in one way or another but this is the first time ive run with in it a serious context for an entire parade
7379168 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7379169 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
7379170 we need to expand our reach and ensure we are a very flexible service provider for all our customer segments
7379171 if were able to offer services from multiple networks all profitably it expands the overall addressable market for us
7379172 in the past weve not always had highly competitive consumer oriented plans to sell into our adsl consumer base
7379173 most of our mobile offerings tended to focus squarely on sme and business customers
7379174 he was always aiming to return for round 22 so we will see how his rehab goes
7379175 he is a good chance to play this week it was a normal hamstring injury so we hope it is only three weeks out because he is really important to us
7379176 we had disappointing losses to west coast and collingwood prior to the last two wins and obviously playing finals you want to go in feeling good about yourself
7379177 we havent looked ahead but there are a few scenarios that could occur
7379178 when the crowd was roaring for robert it was difficult for the opposition id imagine
7379179 its like when you go interstate and there is only one fan base in the crowd it has a powerful affect on teams
7379180 i havent given it the finals any thought at all really
7379181 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7379182 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7379183 now we have to make the best of it improvise adapt to the environment darwin shit happens the i ching whatever roll with it
7379184 what is horrifying in the report that has come out of the rti is that these tests were done from 1 year to 16 years and otherwise there was no division or sub division it was not that it was tried from 12 to 16 and then you wait for 2 to 3 years and therefore small children over the age of 1 year but below the age of 16 years are all used as guinea pigs this is the most serious problem with the tests
7379185 we are approaching national human rights commission because now we feel that if we go by the former head of the department veena kalra by her statement that she gave to a certain newspaper that yes some of these were poor families and died because of clinical trials its strictly violation of article 21 the fundamental right to life
7379186 bikes were just used as a tool to rob the people they only robbed pulsar motorcycles because of its speed and high performance they were not selling or disposing them off
7379187 if one bike broke down they would steal another the reason behind killing the owners of these motorbikes was to avoid identification and evade arrest they did not even hesitate to kill people for rs 2 500
7379188 the other reason to kill was to get the original papers and keys of the bike which owners invariably keep in the vehicles with the original papers in their possession they knew police would not doubt them and they would get away easily
7379189 between june 28 and july 17 the gang committed crimes in delhi and fled to a village garhi shhedra in noida another satellite town of delhi in uttar pradesh and stayed there their photographs were released to the public at the time they committed most of the crimes during that period
7379190 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7379191 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7379192 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7379193 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7379194 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7379195 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7379196 before he got off the plane the pilot wanted to get a picture with todd and his medal
7379197 it hadnt hit me before this i saw you here the american flags waving im close to crying actually
7379198 hes a person you totally want for a dad im glad i have him
7379199 we learned how to do better at passing and digging
7379200 its going to be cool to be in beijing with the u s basketball players
7379201 theyre legitimate celebrities im not i like going out to dinner and not being mobbed
7379202 the real question is longer term will carriers cede control
7379203 im just going to get it cracked because its wrong that its pay
7379204 theyre making money off the backs of the dev team without whom they could never write their programs
7379205 reading about the louisiana taxpayer party efforts to put the paul rockwell
7379206 see the fan is on but the light is off
7379207 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
7379208 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
7379209 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7379210 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7379211 to enlighten the mind and affect the heart are the two main ends of the christian ministry the first demands wisdom and plainness the second fervency as the spirit of scriptural preaching this combination exhibits the minister as a burning and a shining light imparting the spiritual light of divine truth as well as the spiritual heat of divine fervour nothing says baxter is more indecent than a dead preacher speaking to dead sinners the living truth of the living god

7379222 jobs are difficult to come by in this market and for someone who has got a pink slip the scene is worse
7379223 some of my ex colleagues are also finding it tough to get jobs we have even applied to bpos and are waiting to hear from them
7379224 though i was told that firing people on account of low performance is a normal exercise i am sure another chance would have been given if not for the slowdown
7379225 i have no choice but to accept whatever comes my way

7379230 i was singing a gospel song based on the bible verse joshua 1 9 this verse actually carried me to a winning toss and i knew that whatever happened at the end of the day i was not afraid of loss or success winning or coming in tenth place did not determine my worth as a person but my worth in gods eyes is much more than a gold medal
7379231 thanked god for everything that had built for this moment we just wanted to enjoy it we just offered this race back up to him
7379232 in the season of my life that i am in now i feel so blessed that god has given me the talent of running my running is an amazing gift from god and i want to use it to the best of my ability to glorify him
7379233 come appassionato di calcio ho apprezzato la prestazione dellinter quella della roma e anche quella della terna arbitrale non sembrava una partita di agosto le squadre si sono date battaglia per oltre due ore giocando con ritmo e intensit almeno per unora di gioco siamo riusciti a mettere in pratica quanto preparato in settimana pressing alto sulla fonte del loro gioco mi piaciuta molto anche la reazione finale della squadra che ha portato al gol di balotelli lunica cosa fuori contesto stata la loro seconda rete la squadra ha dimostrato di essere psicologicamente molto forte e tatticamente compatta questo un un gruppo eccezionale
7379234 dopo aver giocato bene unora era inevitabile un crollo visto il caldo e lumidit che cera comunque abbiamo mantenuto intatta la voglia di vincere e alla fine nel complesso abbiamo meritato questa supercoppa con questo modulo gioco pi avanti senza preoccuparmi della fase divensiva abbiamo cambiato modo di giocare stiamo lavorando per cercare di mettere in pratica sul campo quello che il mister vuole
7379235 avremmo meritato di vincere nei 90 minuti ma nel calcio il merito non conta bisogna fare gol e in questo siamo stati pari ai rigori siamo stati un po pi bravi il ruolo di difensore giocavo li quando ero pi giovane e sono tornato a occupare questa posizione senza problemi ma ci che conta il gruppo non la volont del singolo
7379236 linter partita meglio e per 45 minuti ci stata superiore e stava meglio fisicamente nel secondo tempo poi siamo andati meglio noi il finale sembrava tutto scritto gol al 90 rigore decisivo di totti che era il figlioccio prediletto del presidente a cui volevamo dedicare questa coppa peccato daltronde lo sport questo e ne prendiamo atto limportante che abbiamo dimostrato che la roma c e pu giocarsela con tutti anche questanno
7379237 ive caught them climbing up the walls and ive asked them what theyre doing and they say oh were playing ninjas

7379240 the church has fallen in love with the state and this love affair is killing the churchs imagination too often the patriotic values of pride and strength triumph over the spiritual virtues of humility gentleness and sacrificial love
7379241 its easy to have political what politicians do but its much harder to embody a political what saints do
7379242 i pulled myself up by my own bootstraps and so can they
7379243 that guys been homeless for 10 years its obvious he wants to be homeless
7379244 excuse me he wants to be homeless no one wants to be homeless even though it may appear that way we need to look at experiences such as physical abuse and emotional trauma the man may have encountered that have resulted in his long term homelessness
7379245 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7379246 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7379247 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7379248 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge

7379250 the christian community in india abhors violence condemns all acts of terrorism and opposes groups of people taking the law into their own hands we have had major differences with mr saraswati the deceased vhp leader it was the hate campaigns of the sangh parivar which led to untold misery for christians including the unprecedented violence last christmas in orissa but we wish peace to everyone and urge everyone to follow the rule of law
7379251 we are concerned at reports of communal violence in the last few hours against innocent christians in nearby districts weve heard that at least one prayer hall in sudergarh was burnt the van of some catholic nuns was destroyed and the sisters were injured we urgently appeal to officials to take whatever steps are required to maintain peace and harmony in all areas of orissa to prevent further attacks on christians and to arrest those responsible for the deaths of saraswati and his associates
7379252 the situation in the district was slowly returning to normal people were engaged in rebuilding houses and settling down after a horrifying experience over christmas 2007 now we are afraid that the death of saraswati will further destabilize the situation in the communally sensitive kandhamal district the aicc will continue to work for peace in orissa one of the most undeveloped states in the country
7379253 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7379254 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7379255 on the surface that seems really good but in the long term it could actually drive out independents and that would be lessening competition and in the long term that wouldnt be good for motorists
7379256 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period
7379257 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle
7379258 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7379259 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7379260 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7379261 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7379262 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption

7379294 first the slovak orchestra is much better than the beijing orchestra which suffers from shrill upper string sound
7379295 more to the point the beijing orchestra is using breiners ideas so blatantly that it would be accused of plagiarism if its arrangers submitted their orchestration as original work in any respectable conservatory it isnt just the rockets red glare breiners basic conception of the whole piece has been copied
7379296 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has apparently attempted to discuss the issue with the committee
7379297 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
7379298 my arrangements of public domain anthems are actually original compositions from a legal point of view
7379299 which means if someone wants to record them they have to purchase the material

7379359 we demand that those holding abdifatah mohammed elmi nigel brennan and amanda lindhout free them unconditionally and immediately we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding three journalists and their driver
7379360 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes bargaining chips or financial purposes
7379361 but journalists who spoke in condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seems to be a pre planned attack

7379372 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7379373 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7379374 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7379375 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7379376 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7379377 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7379378 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7379379 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7379380 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7379381 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7379382 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
7379383 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7379384 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7379385 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7379386 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7379387 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7379388 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7379389 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7379390 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7379411 obama has to hope that biden can connect with hillary inclined white union members
7379412 biden speaks their language he is also surprisingly little known but obama cannot afford to lose 20 or 30 percent of the hillary vote it is going to take a lot of work by the democrats at the convention and beyond to unify the party base
7379413 we connect those things to this candidate and i think our folks see that obama is right for the change
7379414 working families in ohio continue to share joe bidens belief that barack obama lacks the experience and judgment to lead our nation thats why john mccain will continue to engage ohioans of every political party and background on his plans to create jobs and get our economy moving again

7379435 la decisi n es un triunfo para la venezuela democr tica para los que creen en la separaci n de poderes en la justicia en la igualdad ante la ley consideramos que esa es la importancia de la sentencia que adem s les da sosiego a los jueces venezolanos para que puedan ejercer sus funciones de manera aut noma objetiva imparcial pues en la sentencia se reconoce que todo juez en nuestro pa s debe tener estabilidad en sus cargos que de ninguna manera debe ser presionado ni coartado en su libre ejercicio

7379437 la corte teniendo en cuenta que la sala de casaci n penal consider como una
7379438 en modo alguno fue asumido por la m xima autoridad de venezuela como lo que efectivamente fue la sentencia
7379439 fue interpretado de manera arbitraria injusta y amedrentadora en contra de los magistrados de la corte primera de lo contencioso administrativo
7379440 demostramos en la corte interamericana que los jueces en venezuela son los funcionarios p blicos m s desamparados que hay en el pa s sobre todo cuando sus decisiones afectan los intereses del poder esta decisi n obliga en tiempos perentorios al estado venezolano a que salde esa tarea con todos los jueces y funcionarios p blicos del poder judicial

7379507 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7379508 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7379509 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7379510 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7379511 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to

7379515 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7379516 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues

7379520 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7379521 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7379522 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7379523 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7379524 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7379525 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7379526 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter

7379532 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7379533 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7379534 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted

7379548 its a great relief and were happy that hes coming home
7379549 the issues of tibet and freedom of speech in china are still there but it will be nice to have him home so we can work on them together
7379550 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7379551 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7379552 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7379553 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7379554 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7379555 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7379556 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7379557 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7379558 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7379559 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7379560 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7379561 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7379562 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7379563 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7379564 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7379565 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7379566 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7379567 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7379568 the noughties are well on the way to being the worst decade for stocks since 1930 40 back when things were really messy
7379569 the somewhat more bullish tobias levkovitch chief us strategist at citigroup pointed out recently that the s amp p 500 returned just 1 66 from 2000 2007
7379570 he notes that all of the returns so far this decade have come from dividends price return is slightly negative
7379571 you have to pretend youve really noticed that yellow flag remember what mika hakkinen used to do he used to put his hand out of the cockpit to say yeah ive seen it but keep his foot hard on the throttle pedal
7379572 if michael does a victory leap on the podium im personally gonna go and punch him
7379573 scary thing about raikkonen is he doesnt even look 21 does he i think hed get thrown out of a few pubs in the uk
7379574 raikkonens rear tyre decided to take the short cut through the barrier there and cut about half a mile out and make its own way back to the pits
7379575 fisichella is now 30 years old no longer a young man and he needs to be cutting the
7379576 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7379577 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7379578 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7379579 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7379580 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7379581 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7379582 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7379583 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7379584 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7379585 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7379586 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7379587 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7379588 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7379589 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7379590 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7379591 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7379592 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7379593 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7379594 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7379595 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7379596 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7379597 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7379598 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7379599 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7379600 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7379601 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7379602 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7379603 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7379604 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7379605 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7379606 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7379607 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7379608 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7379609 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7379610 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7379611 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7379612 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7379613 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7379614 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7379615 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7379616 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7379617 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7379618 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7379619 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7379620 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7379621 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7379622 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7379623 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7379624 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7379625 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7379626 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7379627 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7379628 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7379629 i was learning about myself my family my wife and my relationships and being a man being a father being a coach now
7379630 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7379631 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7379632 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7379633 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7379634 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7379635 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7379636 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7379637 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7379638 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7379639 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7379640 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7379641 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7379642 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7379643 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7379644 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7379645 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7379646 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7379647 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7379648 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7379649 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7379650 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7379651 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7379652 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7379653 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7379654 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7379655 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7379656 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7379657 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7379658 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7379659 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7379660 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7379661 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7379662 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7379663 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7379664 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7379665 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7379666 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7379667 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7379668 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7379669 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7379670 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7379671 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7379672 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7379673 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7379674 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7379675 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7379676 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7379677 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7379678 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7379679 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7379680 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7379681 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7379682 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7379683 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7379684 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7379685 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7379686 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7379687 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7379688 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7379689 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7379690 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7379691 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7379692 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7379693 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7379694 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7379695 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7379696 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7379697 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7379698 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7379699 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7379700 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7379701 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7379702 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7379703 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7379704 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7379705 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7379706 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7379707 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7379708 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7379709 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7379710 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7379711 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7379712 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7379713 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7379714 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7379715 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7379716 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7379717 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7379718 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7379719 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7379720 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7379721 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7379722 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7379723 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7379724 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7379725 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7379726 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7379727 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7379728 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7379729 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7379730 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7379731 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7379732 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7379733 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7379734 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7379735 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7379736 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7379737 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7379738 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7379739 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7379740 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7379741 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7379742 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7379743 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7379744 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7379745 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7379746 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7379747 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7379748 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7379749 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7379750 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7379751 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7379752 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7379753 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7379754 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7379755 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7379756 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7379757 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7379758 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7379759 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7379760 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7379761 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7379762 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7379763 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7379764 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7379765 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7379766 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7379767 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7379768 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7379769 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7379770 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7379771 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7379772 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7379773 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7379774 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7379775 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7379776 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7379777 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7379778 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7379779 i would as soon see all of the management stop save the money and let nature take its course
7379780 alaskans helping deluded individuals who think they are using wry humor to make social commentary
7379781 first the wolf pack finds the weakest easiest target in the herd usually the young aged or injured
7379782 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7379783 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7379784 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7379785 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7379786 we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7379787 if any of you are capable of killing whatever youre hunting this year in the same manner as a wolf then you might have some real prowess
7379788 at this point its hard to tell colorado has been labeled a purple state
7379789 itll depend on how much money is spent and how the measure is framed
7379790 for those who say look the measure did not make the ballots in all those states they are clearly not looking at the big picture
7379791 of course the easiest way to win is not to have it on the ballot
7379792 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7379793 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7379794 he had been in a conversation with a woman and he was going to meet her
7379795 i just want to know who killed my son and why
7379796 he was very trustworthy and thats what got him killed
7379797 while we were walking we heard this pow pow pow like five or six shots
7379798 we were so scared we ducked between two parked cars
7379799 hes not a human being hes an animal with no conscience
7379800 mr shasho has shown greater concern for the condition of his vehicle than the condition of the victim it left behind
7379801 particularly those which require special care and treatment due to value style and model
7379802 this is the kind of company i want to commit to
7379803 well morgan freeman is out of the hospital you know
7379804 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7379805 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake
7379806 i say all that to say i understand what the songwriter goes through
7379807 that no one knows about but those who are privy to its use they go into the studio on monday morning and bang out a song by mid afternoon and a few months of production later its in a church near you
7379808 weve had a couple calls people had that concern that we werent going to be providing shuttles here
7379809 the lilys coming into being becomes its destruction indeed it seems as if it came into existence and became beautiful only to be destroyed yet the obedient lily obediently submits to this it knows that such is gods will and it shoots up a man or we men in the situation of the lily would be in despair at the thought that coming into existence and destruction was one thing and therefore would prevent ourselves by despair from becoming what we might become though it were but for an instant with the lily it is otherwise it was absolutely obedient hence it became itself in its beauty it became actually its whole possibility undisturbed absolutely undisturbed by the thought that the same instant was its death
7379810 cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once
7379811 i am the church you are the church we are the church together all who follow jesus all around the world yes were the church together
7379812 love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength and love your neighbor as yourself
7379813 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7379814 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7379815 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7379816 we have a few teams down in the area who are working round the clock to help in any way they can there will be a great influx of refugees coming into the cities because their homes were destroyed the teams are currently putting together refugee packs of water and other essentials that will help a little they are estimating 9 million refugees the teams together sent a team of five medically trained into the most heavily afflicted areas and they were planning to spend 36 hours up there but only were able to stay until the evening before officials sent them away they were able to save seven lives but they left feeling terrible because there were still cries for help but they were so far buried underneath the rubble that no one could get them out except for heavy equipment
7379817 my wife put together and led a group of three vehicles out to two village areas yesterday they provided medical care to those who needed medical help including a grandmother and her grandson who had been buried in rubble for a short time they also brought in needed supplies and gave tlc not many of these farmers died as they were out harvesting even though most of their houses were utterly destroyed they fear that they will lose the crops they are now harvesting as all their storage buildings were destroyed today folks are out getting tarps so that the villagers can make storage tents for their crops people are dirty and skin problems are numerous as no one wants to wash in the rivers because of contamination the 14 aid givers were from china singapore canada new zealand and the usa for most of these folks it was the first time they had met each other and yet it was a cohesive group focusing on the needs of the villagers
7379818 the whole country has been affected emotionally it seems even to the point of reminding me of how many americans felt after 9 11 minus the anger mainly there is a contagious sense of fear brokenness hurt despair questioning why and loss in everyones minds for those who have no answers that make sense to this kind of event its really a troubling time as a result many folk beliefs superstitions and ancient thinking about the natural world that would normally be ignored in an atheistic country are resurfacing here for example many tragedies have happened in china this spring including record snowstorms ethnic unrest trainwrecks etc and their dates all add up to 8 the earthquake happened 88 days before the olympics this is ironic because the olympics were appointed to begin on 8 8 08 the luckiest date possible by chinese thinking since 8 is such a fortunate number now in light of all these terrible events some are beginning to wonder if china is under a curse possessed by evil spirits that should be scared away or otherwise out of balance with nature
7379819 as of this past week we have experienced over 8000 aftershocks in our area
7379820 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7379821 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7379822 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7379823 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7379824 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7379825 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7379826 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7379827 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7379828 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7379829 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7379830 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7379831 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
7379832 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
7379833 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
7379834 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
7379835 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
7379836 cada jugador debe defender sus intereses y robinho es bastante mayorcito para ello no es un ni o le respeto mucho porque he pasado por situaciones similares l mites
7379837 han sido uno m s no hab a margen de error y la afici n supli a los dos jugadores que nos faltaron por las expulsiones son partidos de los que te toca una noche de cara porque ten amos las de perder pero se ha ganado
7379838 esto es f tbol ha sido mi primera falta del partido y me expulsan lo importante ha sido ganar en un encuentro pico que hemos ganado con nueve jugadores
7379839 su segunda parte ha sido muy buena muy peligrosa ha ayudado al real madrid a dar la vuelta al partido
7379840 estaba desesperado cuando me expulsaron pensaba en qu bamos a hacer con nueve lo que pudimos ganar y marcar tres goles m s es incre ble
7379841 lo viv dentro del vestuario con rafa van der vaart por la televisi n dos delanteros expulsados nos mir bamos y nos dec amos qu ha pasado esto es lo nunca visto

7379845 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7379846 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7379847 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
7379848 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
7379849 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
7379850 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health
7379851 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7379852 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7379853 we know that as a close friend you will continue to play a very important role in the building of our state
7379854 rcr has commenced the new financial year with a strong order book relating to non recurring project work currently standing at 170 million compared to 50 million at the corresponding period last year
7379855 the workload is expected to increase over the next few years based on the resources oil and gas market remaining strong and infrastructure spending continuing in the energy sector
7379856 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7379857 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7379858 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7379859 not getting a win all year and getting all of those seconds was killing him so im really happy for him to win the race he was the quickest car out there today its just great for the team
7379860 to start the week off the way we did with the fire and everything and then dominate with a one two qualifying and race result its definitely the strongest weve been all year
7379861 the fraternity pulled together with us and helped us get back together
7379862 all these guys they are racers a great group of guys its all about people and helio and briscoe really did a great job today we have tough competition out there
7379863 the reported net profit includes significant items of 35 million comprising amortisation of intangibles on acquisition integration and one off acquisition costs and impairment charges
7379864 we have an international footprint of over 13 000 customers providing substantial recurring revenues and a base primed for the release of our products
7379865 full year 2009 will see the global launch of our unique platform lorenzo delivering a service oriented healthcare platform to our existing customers
7379866 the key relationships with national health service in the united kingdom and the irish health service executive have been enhanced at the strategic and operational levels and additional contracted revenues secured
7379867 long term contract renewals have also been achieved in europe while in australia and south east asia iba has continued to be successful in winning new business in the state acute hospitals sector and with significant corporate players in the primary care sector
7379868 these laws will give the commonwealth government power to suspend welfare payments if people dont have their children enrolled and regularly attending school
7379869 but theres no excuse for not having children regularly attending school
7379870 if children are to benefit from education if they are to get the best start in life then they must be enrolled in and regularly attending school
7379871 we want to fix that statistic were concerned about it
7379872 there is evidence that at least 2 000 children are not even enrolled to go to school in the northern territory
7379873 suspending a parents welfare payment will be a last resort
7379874 we know that teachers and principals at the moment work very hard with their families to try and get their children attending on a regular basis
7379875 but in the end we want the children to go to school and thats why we intend to introduce this legislation
7379876 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7379877 az nem emdzs emt hanem d menedzsment csak ler vid tett k
7379878 hey isnt the whole fighting overwhelming odds on some broken spacecraft thing kind of overdone at this point
7379879 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7379880 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7379881 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7379882 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7379883 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7379884 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7379885 they told us their two friends were underwater and that they were drowning
7379886 are you crazy kid this line is for stockholders and people who want to open a part of the chain talk to the actual store if you want a job
7379887 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
7379888 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
7379889 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
7379890 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
7379891 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer
7379892 the recommendations developed are not intended to be used in a cookbook or prescriptive manner or to limit a physicians clinical judgment
7379893 they provide guidance based on clinical evidence and expert panel input
7379894 the russians are definitely putting the biggest effort into the north
7379895 they built it up more theyre further ahead on resource development and they also have the largest ice breaking fleet
7379896 theyre ahead of the game on the submissions for the law of the sea
7379897 the longer they stay out the longer the russians are able to consolidate their position to their advantage
7379898 this places considerable doubt on the version of mr bird
7379899 they have the option of getting free independent legal advice
7379900 its an independent bunch of lawyers that telstra has arranged they are experts in the field and will give independent help with interpretations of the clauses of the offer
7379901 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7379902 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7379903 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7 300 a year
7379904 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7379905 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7379906 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7379907 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7379908 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance

7379911 these temporary measures are meant to address the issue temporarily says tao dong chief asia economist at credit suisse in hong kong
7379912 you cant prohibit people from driving their cars youre going to have a riot
7379913 i was here in february i dont see no blue sky he said
7379914 first few days when we went out i was coughing a lot after says american george hincapie who finished 40th
7379915 i didnt like the pollution bronze medalist yun ok hee of south korea says
7379916 the government is taking measures in the right direction but it needs to be scaled up mr troedsson said
7379917 they are meaning business in terms of structural changes that will positively influence the climate and the environment rogge said yesterday
7379918 oh my god he she looked sounded sang just like so and so
7379919 we wanted to develop and test some new and innovative strategies to improve pregnancy and postnatal health in disadvantaged communities
7379920 caboolture was chosen to represent disadvantaged communities more broadly because of its relative socio economic disadvantage
7379921 caboolture is also characterised by poor maternal and infant health outcomes relative to the rest of australia and queensland
7379922 most pregnant women reported unhealthy levels of physical activity and daily intake of fruit and vegetables and almost a quarter smoked
7379923 smoking during pregnancy was significantly associated with younger age no private health insurance and lower income and education
7379924 remarkably given what we know from clinical trials that demonstrate the importance of these pregnancy behaviours for maternal and infant health we have not up until now had any population level data for either fruit and vegetable intake or physical activity in pregnant women
7379925 we are able to do this by linking data from the statewide perinatal outcomes systematically recorded by queensland health with the individual data that we have collected from about 800 pregnant women
7379926 up until now all the research has been on the specific effect of one of these behaviours with health outcomes so we havent been able to tell which behaviours we should be prioritising to maximise health benefits for women and babies
7379927 these findings demonstrate the need for reorienting pregnancy and postnatal care and considerable room for improvement in promoting preventative health behaviours to maximise maternal and infant health outcomes
7379928 if youre not in the data center we have exchange express an ethernet product
7379929 opinion is divided over the reasons for the loss of this species
7379930 climate change over fishing pollution and habitat destruction have all been advanced as possible causes however no research has been carried out to fully quantify the burbots decline this study will examine the role of changes in water temperature habitat connectivity and river discharge in the burbots extinction
7379931 we would like to encourage members of the public particularly those who have a close relationship with our rivers and waterways to take time to complete the survey as opinions gathered will be a vital component of our research
7379932 a silent mass extinction is occurring in our gt comprehensive study indentifies critical watersheds for conserving at risk freshwater species
7379933 rcr has commenced the new financial year with a strong order book relating to non recurring project work currently standing at 170 million compared to 50 million at the corresponding period last year
7379934 the workload is expected to increase over the next few years based on the resources oil and gas market remaining strong and infrastructure spending continuing in the energy sector
7379935 it is not at all clear whether these compounds reach the brain in sufficient concentrations and in a biologically active form to exert beneficial effects
7379936 the potential for improved quality of life is huge the number of people suffering from cartilage problems is increasing every year
7379937 total joint replacement is very successful but may not be appropriate for younger more active people they are often encouraged to put off surgery until the pain is disabling but a conservative replacement treatment could relieve pain and restore function at a much earlier stage
7379938 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
7379939 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
7379940 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
7379941 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future
7379942 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
7379943 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
7379944 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
7379945 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
7379946 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
7379947 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
7379948 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
7379949 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
7379950 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
7379951 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
7379952 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
7379953 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
7379954 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
7379955 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
7379956 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
7379957 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
7379958 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
7379959 i guess there is this little catholic girl inside me somewhere but i did want to be a nun when i was very little well that was until my sister told me that they dont get paid then i went off the idea really quickly
7379960 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
7379961 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
7379962 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
7379963 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
7379964 these guys came in for a good cause to help out and its not starting out so good
7379965 its more emotional because there are so many memories associated with them
7379966 answer such questions as what is scientology how does it forward the cause for human rights what are its approaches to education drug abuse and how does scientology motivate people to fulfill the potential of their personal and professional lives
7379967 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
7379968 decisions are not only based on risks and benefits but also the identity that a given choice communicates to others consequently shifting perceptions of the identity associated with a risky behavior can help make better health a reality
7379969 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
7379970 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7379971 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
7379972 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7379973 the queensland government and uq established in 2007 a joint scholarship to foster the study of the russian language with excellent results
7379974 queensland has a lot of catch up to do teaching structures need to be changed if we are to lift our educational standards to meet the minimum international quality benchmarks
7379975 monolingualism will be increasingly less tolerated by the economy and our international universities now realise that proficiency in more than one world language is one of the keys to a successful regional and global engagement
7379976 students who start studying a language at this late stage have less time to acquire the proficiency level required to do any serious postgraduate study by the time they complete their bachelor degree
7379977 pressure on the tertiary sector to provide introductory language teaching makes it difficult for language departments to focus on the technical and expert levels they should be engaging with for example training of translators and interpreters advanced cultural studies and applied linguistics
7379978 the selection of venue is an important factor as consumers will consider if it is worth the time and effort to physically go to attend the event
7379979 whilst not being physically present to see the birds nest stadium and the water cube in beijing the uniqueness and size of these venues are simply breathtaking even on tv
7379980 managers of such large scale events must shrewdly select performers that are able to draw crowds based on their performance excellence
7379981 in addition not only must there be a sufficient number of staff to help customers these staff must also be knowledgeable to answer customers queries
7379982 others have commented that the olympics in beijing may have been somewhat over managed
7379983 i am keen to make a difference in this important area of the service economy the measurements i have developed will allow managers to benchmark and better manage their customers experience so that they can consistently provide high quality and memorable entertainment services
7379984 were not tough sophisticated play goers and really wanted to like the play
7379985 but the best we could give it might be a c papatolas review is less than our comments on the drive home but pretty much sums up our thoughts
7379986 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
7379987 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
7379988 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
7379989 prover servi os para que um usu rio possa despublicar seus v deos do site
7379990 the amount of software is growing very rapidly and it is increasingly difficult to find the people and resources necessary to develop it all
7379991 as a result europe is seeing a lot of development work transferring to india and other countries an additional problem lies in the speed of development as it is necessary to get solutions to market in optimum time and with sufficient reliability that it works properly
7379992 agile is a new paradigm for software development that emerged around eight years ago in the usa
7379993 when we started the itea project in 2004 we did not know whether this new methodology could be exploited for embedded software in avionics telecommunications automotive and consumer electronics
7379994 we turned this around to identify those critical features that would be used and put the emphasis on getting them to market first
7379995 so we are not always talking about technical issues when developing software but focusing on business level issues and this was part of the methodology of our development
7379996 eureka projects involve a lot less bureaucracy than with the eu framework programme projects
7379997 moreover over three years the world changes and with eureka you can change the direction of the project meeting better the demands of the industrial partners this is the clear advantage of eureka in addition itea offers a community that meets on a yearly basis and people get to know each other i think both industry and academia find this big networking element strengthens their capabilities
7379998 a set of values and a set of 12 principles provide the underlying rationale for why we operate in this way
7379999 and the process is very tightly time framed with delivery in monthly or even fortnightly cycles in previous approaches we were trying to deliver working systems in maybe three month six month or even one year cycles
