4020000 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
4020001 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
4020002 not up to the standards of the national enquirer updated
4020003 top ten ways the dnc is like the beijing olympics
4020004 is it an insult to call obama an affirmative action candidate
4020005 to any and all u s forces in georgia stand down
4020006 common denominator israel at every level is prepared to strike iran
4020007 if we could just tick a box and move on it would make everyones life easier but now this really is a long term behavioural and educational campaign
4020008 we expect that russia will respect the humanitarian nature of that mission and that ports sea lanes air routes will all be open for humanitarian purposes another pledge that russia has undertaken to the french
4020009 there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
4020010 i am going first to meet with the french president and other members of the french government in france
4020011 and then i will fly on to tbilisi to underscore the strong support of the united states for the georgian people and for their democratically elected government
4020012 what happened at that school constitutes race discrimination under federal anti discrimination laws that is why it is important that needs to be stopped
4020013 how can the internet make the world a better place
4020014 anybody who has travelled overseas and used their mobile phone knows how useful it can be to reach loved ones and conduct business using international mobile roaming they also know the significant cost they pay for this privilege the house of representatives communications committee is inquiring into whether international mobile roaming charges are fair the committee will look at whether retail international mobile roaming charges reflect the underlying costs whether the information available on international mobile roaming costs are adequate whether new technologies and commercial initiatives will reduce international mobile roaming charges and whether consumer information on international roaming is adequate
4020015 international roaming charges are the subject of complaints where prices are high making it very expensive to make mobile phone calls while overseas this issue deserves attention particularly as mobile data services grow and businesses come to rely even more on cross border access
4020016 our action was to speak out at this critical moment in the history of the tibetan people in solidarity with the tibetan peoples attempts to confront chinas brutal occupation of their homeland
4020017 china is using the olympics as an attempt to erase tibet from history and to tell the world a lie at this critical moment
4020018 china is silencing tibetans the chinese government is not issuing any visas to tibetans this summer during the olympics
4020019 my action is in solidarity with all those who wanted to travel to china to protest but were silenced
4020020 theyre a scrappy team but i think we out scrapped them
4020021 true love is when you have to watch a friend leave with the knowledge that you might never see him again but you know hell be in your mind and heart forever
4020022 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4020023 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
4020024 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4020025 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4020026 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4020027 urban failed even after reporting a profit last year and lots of firms in this sector have borrowed heavily how can investors tell which companies are in danger
4020028 thats why real estate and related stocks except for the biggest companies have become untouchable
4020029 id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4020030 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
4020031 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
4020032 i see him all the time at least once a week
4020033 who could have sex the longest i think thats an event i can do well in
4020034 the former friends star has been unable to find love since her divorce four years ago from brad pitt
4020035 the biggest thrill for me is just the way our team won the game
4020036 i mean its easy to put your head down after a team puts up six runs on you and just let it go we didnt do that
4020037 theres plenty of ways to lose games and weve all been through it before
4020038 its nothing new it hurts i mean they all hurt
4020039 it was something supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4020040 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4020041 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4020042 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute
4020043 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4020044 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offense and has apologized
4020045 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4020046 i fight here as they fight there today i feel like i am a georgian
4020047 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence but they are not
4020048 we had a good match i want to congratulate them and i do not want there to be a war between us
4020049 a member of the u s diving team was disqualified when it was learned that he did not have a sufficiently compelling human story line to exploit on nbc
4020050 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4020051 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4020052 our focus right now is on delivering humanitarian aid and taking care of the immediate needs of those who are caught in this conflict
4020053 when the dust settles i am sure that we will help this sovereign nation and ally rebuild its military
4020054 its never zero risk but i think it will be ok
4020055 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
4020056 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4020057 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
4020058 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
4020059 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4020060 the federal courts have clearly indicated for 30 40 years that inmates have not lost the right to receive basic medical care
4020061 so there is a constitutional obligation here this is not something the state has a choice about
4020062 i heard that he was doing well and hes healthy were just interested in what the charges are

4020072 according to survey results of what we fear your telling me that at a funeral most people would rather be the guy in the coffin than have to stand up and give a eulogy
4020073 its just like the 1990s when we spent nights on the streets shouting at the top of our voices
4020074 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day

4020076 i will be putting pen to paper at some point yes
4020077 they will be an attempt to put in a longer term historical perspective the events of more than 33 years of public life
4020078 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally

4020080 you havent changed nice to see you all i wouldnt want you to change you were so loveable in your old form
4020081 a recent media report suggested that 15 per cent of all zinc miners are operating at a loss at current metal prices
4020082 we remain well positioned to ride out this part of the cycle and expect lead and zinc prices to regain long term levels in the coming months
4020083 metal commodity prices including lead and zinc have retreated significantly in the last few weeks and months causing the industry to dramatically reassess current and future business plans
4020084 teck cominco has shut the lennard shelf base metal operation in western australia aim resources has suspended development of the perkoa zinc project in burkina faso west africa and cbh resources has elected to cut their workforce at the endeavour mine in cobar nsw and target high grade ore to remain viable
4020085 in the medium term the curtailing of new projects makes it inevitable that prices will go much higher to meet demand which is still growing strongly
4020086 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4020087 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4020088 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4020089 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4020090 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4020091 the jets game means a lot to me especially after the way last season finished
4020092 that was very disappointing and definitely stupid and id like to just erase all memory of that really
4020093 its been mixed emotions watching the matches ive got my good friends playing at the olympics and im so happy for them to be there representing australia
4020094 but at the same time i know that i should be there with them and i would be if i didnt do what i did in the grand final
4020095 its tough to take but ive only got myself to blame for it all im looking forward to getting past it now
4020096 i train with him every day and weve become very good mates in the few weeks hes been here
4020097 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but just in life in general hes a very smart man and hes passed on a lot of advice to me in the short time hes been with us
4020098 there was a time there where i thought everything was against me
4020099 hes been through a lot himself and hes told me things will always get better and not to be too hard on myself
4020100 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4020101 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4020102 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4020103 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot
4020104 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4020105 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4020106 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4020107 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
4020108 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
4020109 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
4020110 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
4020111 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
4020112 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas australian workplace agreements or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
4020113 nem haja alguma raiz de amargura que brotando nos perturbe e por meio dela muitos sejam contaminados

4020134 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4020135 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4020136 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4020137 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4020138 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4020139 i think the administration has most of what they need
4020140 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly

4020144 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were
4020145 it would kind of be an insult to the system to not have at least an assault conviction out of this

4020148 what the defendant failed to do however was to retreat from the house or walk away and call the police about the disturbance

4020154 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4020173 whats fascinating about this study is that you would not expect to find contagious yawning where you did not have self awareness
4020174 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
4020175 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
4020176 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
4020177 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
4020178 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
4020179 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
4020180 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
4020181 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
4020182 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
4020183 sayang kamu manis sekali oh iya menurutmu wanita yang seperti itu cantik ga atau gayanya keren ga

4020190 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
4020191 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
4020192 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
4020193 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
4020194 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
4020195 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
4020196 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing

4020219 at first when she proposed the rachmaninoff sonata which we have performed several times together i said no way theres something like 59 recordings of it and i told her wed just be one more in the mix but then over time she suggested adding the miaskovsky sonata and then little pieces crept in here and there i figured why not

4020224 but its not like he taught me the cello when i came to him i was already formed in my technique and i had my own sound but it didnt have a lot of variety he was so amazing at getting different colors from the cello he added to my range and he always impressed on me to see the bigger picture he pushed me to go beyond what i thought my limits were
4020225 i still have detailed notes from my lessons with him

4020304 we gather intelligence from other sources and the dob in a druggie program corroborates that
4020305 the extent of drug use is a real worry especially for a town the size of wagin
4020306 but i can assure you that this is just the start of our campaign to crack down on the drug problem and we have a number of other targets within our police sub district
4020307 wagin williams and narrogin are now all in the same cell
4020308 this means 25 police officers can be in wagin within 30 minutes if it is an emergency operational necessity
4020309 the wagin police will not lose their focus on road safety but there will be a major focus on criminality from now on

4020318 we were working with the same producer in new york city at the end of my trip it was just when i first started going to new york and not really knowing anybody i was like please god somebody take me out
4020319 so i made him take me out all his friends were there and we ended up dancing and making out on the dancefloor
4020320 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4020321 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4020322 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4020323 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4020324 ricardo chavira hates kissing me we are both not really fond of the kissing scenes
4020325 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4020326 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4020327 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again

4020332 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4020333 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4020334 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4020335 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4020336 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4020337 i knew that it was gonna make a splash but i didnt know that it was going to be such a huge cannonball
4020338 so im happy that it did im excited that it did
4020339 i dont get it you cant be a positive person all of the time how do you do it
4020340 each morning i wake up and say to myself jerry you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood i choose to be in a good mood each time something bad happens i can choose to be a victim or i can choose to learn from it i choose to learn from it every time someone comes to me complaining i can choose to accept their complaining or i can point out the positive side of life i choose the positive side of life
4020341 life is all about choices when you cut away all the junk every situation is a choice you choose how you react to situations you choose how people will affect your mood you choose to be in a good mood or bad mood the bottom line its your choice how you live life
4020342 if i were any better id be twins wanna see my scars
4020343 the first thing that went through my mind was that i should have locked the back door
4020344 then as i lay on the floor i remembered that i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die i chose to live
4020345 well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me

4020352 a number of such young composers artists and authors such as john steinbeck writing his first book in 1929 cannot predict the high stature they would attain and the popular prominence of their works in musical and literary conciousness not to mention the eventual high financial rewards to them and their families their work can command
4020353 having the effect of disinheriting the statutory heirs to the termination interest the steinbeck descendants in favor of elaines heirs must be set aside as contrary to the very purpose of the termination statute
4020354 there arent a lot of decisions interpreting termination rights under the copyright law
4020355 by the courts decision the wishes of john steinbeck related to the ownership of his literary works has been validated

4020359 el espect culo fue dise ado y creado para el escenario del generalife algo que se ha notado cuando hemos viajado con l fuera ya que en alguna ocasi n hemos tenido que reducir los espacios
4020360 el romancero de lorca es un resumen del esp ritu del poeta y de su uni n con el pueblo gitano motivo por el que tanto la obra como el espect culo tienen tanta fuerza profundidad y energ a
4020361 cuando comenc a darle forma a la obra record una escena que tengo grabada de mi infancia un grupo de gitanos hablando bajo un puente imagen que he adaptado a la obra en la que el puente es una enorme viga de cemento
4020362 el escenario del generalife es posiblemente uno de los mejores en los que he estado esa sensaci n de estar bailando levantar las manos y ver la luna es nica muy especial
4020363 la esencia m s profunda de lorca y la magistral presencia de cristina hoyos se al an para resucitar las m s conocidas poes as del autor universal
4020364 verde que te quiero verde es el hilo conductor romance de la luna luna es la historia de un ni o que muere y su sue o es la luna preciosa y el aire es una ni a que baila en el mar es el contrapunto a la anterior es la vida en todo su esplendor
4020365 hay dos momentos siempre muy especiales durante el espect culo como son el desnudo de las monjas y el baile de los agentes de la guardia civil que retratan la rebeld a del poeta

4020376 no es m s cara pues aunque requiera m s mano de obra si los productos se vendieran a su precio no habr a problemas
4020377 los distintos sectores agroalimentarios deber an estar m s unidos como en otros pa ses y hacer un precio conjunto que beneficie a todos

4020395 en una semana ha dejado de hablar de plan de choque y se ha desmentido a s mismo ahora dice que no presenta un plan de choque sino un avance de las inversiones

4020402 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4020403 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4020404 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4020405 the tropical forest should be protected as it is rich in biological varieties
4020406 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4020407 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4020410 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4020411 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4020412 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4020413 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4020414 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4020415 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4020416 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4020417 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4020418 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4020424 i dont think any of us believes what we say we believe its just our neurons responding to a phrase or something a learned response that makes us feel warm for some reason that goes back to childhood and in the end it doesnt matter were motes of dust on a tiny insignificant planet spinning around in a solar system so vast our minds cant comprehend it and one day the planet will implode and all will be lost beethoven plato monet the minnesota twins and it wont make any difference to the cosmos whatsoever so why should we care who wins the election in november

4020428 i would have liked to have had an opportunity to put my case forward
4020429 dominic corks dont come off the conveyer belt very few players can do what he does on a cricket field
4020430 to get the quality that he shows where are we going to get that from in times of need when things arent going our way you throw the ball to dominic and he can make things happen
4020431 i dont know how these decisions are made but ive got to walk out with these players and if theyre not in the best frame of mind ive got to deal with it
4020432 people sitting up there drinking their gin and tonic dont have to deal with it
4020433 it would have been easier to go into a season with corky in your side but once again its an opportunity for someone to come in fill the boots and prove me wrong dominics been a fantastic servant to not only lancashire cricket but derbyshire and england
4020434 ill probably get in to a lot of trouble for what ive said but i just think that dominic cork is a quality performer
4020435 we have an economy which is diversified we have a workforce that we have upgraded year by year better educated better able to earn more because we are connected with the world and our incomes can rise because of our higher skills and higher technology
4020436 we have succeeded so far in housing in health in education in job facilities
4020437 we will do our best to re train people who are being retrenched to upgrade their skills but we must face facts this gap is going to remain for five ten or more years
4020438 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4020439 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4020440 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4020441 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4020442 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4020443 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4020444 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4020445 last year 2007 was a record year for blogger arrests with three times as many as in 2006 egypt iran and china are the most dangerous places to blog about political life accounting for more than half of all arrests since blogging became big
4020446 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4020447 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4020448 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4020449 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4020450 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4020451 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4020452 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4020453 this is not an attempt to put military assets in closer proximity to inject u s forces into this conflict
4020454 i wouldnt expect a naval ship to be showing up in the black sea until weve determined what precisely the need is
4020455 im talking about the impotence and inability of both europe and the united states to be unified and to exert leverage and to comprehend the level of the threat
4020456 he was saying its a difficult situation he said their tanks are 40 kilometers from tbilisi this is where we are
4020457 i think it was presented as you need to sign on to this
4020458 my guess is it was presented as this is the best i can get
4020459 kept asking to see the chairman and she tried to stall him but he went past her and she heard three gunshots
4020460 she was sitting here going over it in her mind he was a white man in a white shirt with khaki pants middle aged
4020461 its very sad to hear that something like this has happened to him
4020462 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4020463 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4020464 it is indeed a tragedy for not only the city but the entire state of arkansas
4020465 i know sometimes in these days and times we see these senseless tragedies i hope we can learn the facts of this
4020466 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4020467 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us
4020468 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney
4020469 were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4020470 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
4020471 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
4020472 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
4020473 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
4020474 offer strong evidence of the correlation between low level radiation exposure and result ing health damages
4020475 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
4020476 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
4020477 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
4020478 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
4020479 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
4020480 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
4020481 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
4020482 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
4020483 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the u s department of transportation
4020484 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
4020485 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
4020486 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
4020487 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
4020488 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
4020489 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
4020490 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the u s government and dod would like us to believe
4020491 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
4020492 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
4020493 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
4020494 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
4020495 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
4020496 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
4020497 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
4020498 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004 representing the federal governments third largest reported liability it represents a significant future outflow of funds at the same time as many other competing demands for federal dollars but is currently not auditable
4020499 plague the mysterious past and terrrify future of the worlds most dangerous disease
4020500 the united states has experienced an anthrax attack and security experts repeatedly express concern that future attacks with biological weapons are likely if not inevitable
4020501 you take what you can get not many people with his abilities show up very often
4020502 there are 15 000 to 16 000 people now working in labs on select agents thats many more possibilities of another bizarre individual doing illicit work
4020503 human beings can be silly because we move away from things too quickly in this country
4020504 streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown
4020505 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
4020506 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
4020507 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
4020508 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice
4020509 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job
4020510 today young educated workers move to cities with a sense of place and if businesses see us laying rail down on a street theyll know thats a permanent route that will have people passing by seven days a week
4020511 we have to compete for talent and for place of national prominence
4020512 it is directly tied to economic development and when times are tough in ohio we need an additional tool to create jobs
4020513 i believe in 10 years we would ask why didnt we do this it will be 10 times more expensive and the cost of gas will be unaffordable
4020514 they feel like they have enough capital but nobody really knows
4020515 are a relatively unknown portion of the mortgage market but could be another wrinkle for mortgage lending
4020516 so thats today what happens a year from now that is the concern out there that these companies will face more problems ahead
4020517 we have an interest in trying to cure as many of these loans as possible the more loans that are cured means well have to pay fewer claims
4020518 that to a great extent is where i would say their higher risk exposures came from
4020519 the current weakened financial condition of many of our mortgage insurance counterparties creates an increased risk that our mortgage insurer counterparties will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims
4020520 all you have to do is say they are no longer eligible to do fannie freddie business and they are out of business
4020521 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
4020522 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
4020523 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
4020524 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4020525 the federal courts have clearly indicated for 30 40 years that inmates have not lost the right to receive basic medical care
4020526 so there is a constitutional obligation here this is not something the state has a choice about
4020527 where ivins could have possibly stored this anthrax without any employees seeing it or if he took it home why there was no trace
4020528 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4020529 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4020530 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4020531 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4020532 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4020533 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4020534 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4020535 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4020536 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4020537 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take
4020538 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
4020539 especially in politics you have a crowded book market and theres probably room for five or six takes that can be totally different
4020540 its ultimately up to the reader to decide which one he likes
4020541 the interest is not here its not showing up in polls
4020542 what do you say to that crowd that will resonate to the people of virginia
4020543 i am excited about this chance to showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia and the results we achieved in our effort to help people compete in a changing economy
4020544 barack obamas natural base is not the business community yet probably there is no democrat more respected by american business leadership than mark warner
4020545 a lot of us including me supported mark because we did not like the direction the state republican party was headed
4020546 the far right has dominated the virginia republican party in recent years both mark and tim kaine were alternatives to that on the virginia scene but i dont know that that transfers support to the national democratic ticket
4020547 the response to these fires has severely taxed californias resources
4020548 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
4020549 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
4020550 we cant afford not to fight fires homes and lives are at stake
4020551 these fires are only going to become more frequent and more intense
4020552 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
4020553 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
4020554 the much hyped sebi meet turned out to be a no show as it decided not to change its policy on p notes
4020555 in the medium to long term the market may not be able to rise sharply as fiis may continue their selling spree
4020556 the fastest growing segment 25 1 cagr of the t amp m industry over the next several years will be pxi based systems according to research by madhan dhandayutham a senior research analyst at frost amp sullivan
4020557 articles intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals
4020558 articles other than food intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals
4020559 i cant understand this whos discussing this youre discussing this
4020560 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4020561 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4020562 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4020563 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4020564 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4020565 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
4020566 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
4020567 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place
4020568 fords panther line of cars which consists of the crown victoria lincoln town car and grand marquis is designed with the fuel tank located outside the protection of the rear axle and within the cars
4020569 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4020570 i am getting a puppy this weekend and i have read your my smart puppy book and watched the video but i am not clear on how to teach the no command please help
4020571 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
4020572 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
4020573 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4020574 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4020575 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4020576 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of
4020577 was f r jeden brief ein bildchen datei das ist ja viel zu kompliziert
4020578 legen sie doch f r jedes schriftst ck eine neue datei an denken sie sich eine gute namenskonvention f r das benennen der dateien aus und nutzen sie eine sinnvolle ordnerstruktur um den berblick zu behalten
4020579 in the bustle of life in the pressure of decisions peace has become a luxury take it when it come and cherish it it give you time to breathe it gives you rest and hope and life
4020580 i love history so much thats why i want to take ap u s history
4020581 almost as though they are two halves of the same novel
4020582 no fornicaras y si alguno ve a su projima con lujuria auqnue no le hable ya fornico con ella en su corazon
4020583 pienso a veces cuando me dijiste que no te dejara o cuando te dije que mi mayor miedo era perderte hemos tenido muchos problemas y en estos mas de dos meses nunca me descuide contigo te mandaba mensajes semanal o te llamaba a veces a veces por que me hablabas de mala gana sali perdiendo yo claro pienso si fue un impulso o verdad lo que me dijiste pero viendo las cosas es verdad no quiero ser tu amigo pero tampoco obligo a nadie a estar conmigo no figas que no hablamos en estos dos meses por que es mentira y no se hasta donde llegaste con tus mentiras tal vez todo el tiempo y yo el idiota confianzudo lo crei todo tenia la minima esperanza pero se me adelantaron y lo nico que me queda es la soledad no digo esto aunque paresca que doy pena despecho mentira o que vuelvas conmigo o que lo digo por diversi n no me siento muy mal por todo esto y lo dice mi coraz n y el no miente me imagino que debes de estar ri ndote de todo y por este mensaje y yo preocupado y sufriendo y tu quien sabe pero como te dije una vez dios sabe lo que hace y de ti no quiero saber absolutamente nada
4020584 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions
4020585 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4020586 we were only able to test the capabilities as a single flash unit and in conjunction with the d700s built in flash and not having reviewed the sb 800 we were unable to compare the performance of the two flash units suffice it to say we found the test sample to be an excellent performer that delivered an evenly exposed set of test shots with different camera to subject distances and focal length settings in use we found recycling to be almost silent and very fast with nimh rechargeables matching the 2 3 second recycle times claimed in the specifications
4020587 i cannot express the simplicity and accuracy of this device enough
4020588 unfortunately its not all rosy in low light and in my dimly lit studio the autofocus struggles to lock onto the subject in half decent light its fast and efficient but certainly with the 24 120mm f 3 5 vr lens i had for the review it was frustratingly slow at times on a more positive note the large lcd is a real boon for checking images and is accurate for exposure if not spot on for colour but good enough
4020589 out of all 10 provinces the worst effect will be on people that are middle class in nova scotia
4020590 minister baird in parroting the vulgar language of stephen harper is not contributing to that debate
4020591 canadians can therefore expect to bear costs under the regulatory framework that are not trivial
4020592 at the same time these costs strike an appropriate balance between environmental results and manageable economic impacts
4020593 our staff they currently do a lot of overtime for us to the extent in a lot of units that it is difficult to ask them to do more than theyre currently doing
4020594 so we go to external staffing when we know that theres something there we cant fill
4020595 what youve got is a public sector employer funded by government paying a private sector company
4020596 our staff they currently do a lot of overtime for us to the extent in a lot of units that it is difficult to ask them to do more than theyre currently doing

4020600 minister baird in parroting the vulgar language of stephen harper is not contributing to that debate
4020601 canadians can therefore expect to bear costs under the regulatory framework that are not trivial
4020602 at the same time these costs strike an appropriate balance between environmental results and manageable economic impacts
4020603 the next thing i heard him arguing with mr carter
4020604 i could hear some profane names he was calling him and how he was going to get it
4020605 im going to go outside and see what hes going to do to him
4020606 i couldnt believe the blood that mr carter was lying facedown in the blood was coming out of his ears out of his nose it was just pouring out
4020607 that family im telling you right now will mourn for a long long time

4020620 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results

4020622 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4020623 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion
4020624 she was an expert in her field phd an internationally recognized authority on education education for women and girls especially in conflict settings
4020625 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4020626 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
4020627 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
4020628 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
4020629 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
4020630 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
4020631 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
4020632 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
4020633 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
4020634 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
4020635 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4020636 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion

4020646 moses and seya the third man who is still being sought jumped through a window and i followed moses and seya caught the fitches as they tried to run away and threw them down
4020647 i tied their hands behind their back they did not fight back we shouted and asked where the money was and keys for the safe he said he did not have any
4020648 moses and seya brought her and threw her next to mr fitch we asked for money moses and seya kicked him all over the head and body i did not try to stop them
4020649 we asked them for the safe key but they did not reply moses got a blue plastic bag and lit it and started burning it over mr fitchs legs and upper body his clothing was also burning she was also burnt with the plastic
4020650 i heard gunshots and hit the floor i didnt really see anything but heard a lot of shots when i lifted my head i saw one robber running away with a cash box
4020651 whether they turned left towards hillbrow or right towards alexandra we do not know but we are still investigating
4020652 having had an std roughly quadruples a womans odds of reporting sexual pain and triples her lubrication problems
4020653 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
4020654 this turnover tax is designed for much smaller businesses with annual turnover less than r600 000
4020655 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
4020656 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4020657 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4020658 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4020659 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage

4020661 misleading inaccurate and inappropriate in a campaign for high judicial office
4020662 these guys are standing behind candidates they like if they havent already they ought to register as a political action committee
4020663 but i do know the candidates are highly aware of the existence of this committee and are approaching their campaigns considering among other things are we likely to incur public condemnation by this group of washington citizens and i think thats good they should consider it
4020664 the marketplace will drive the decision but im a staunch advocate of public power
4020665 puget sound energy has the most expensive power in the state so i think its an inevitability that the citizens of the county will turn to the public utility for electric service
4020666 you have to have an open mind about the future but i believe the utility should concentrate on providing quality water at a reasonable cost
4020667 puget sound energy is an important issue but any decision by the utility to become an electric utility would depend solely on community interest
4020668 there would have to be a groundswell of support the pud is not touching the issue right now
4020669 so the centennials will get some but not as much as the garfields or the hansens
4020670 i saw them finishing construction on this aboiteau just last summer it just goes to show you the power of the tides
4020671 it may look like the river is doing the damage but that isnt the case
4020672 this is a case of the tides coming in two weeks ago and simply destroying an aboiteau the agriculture department put in just last year its also a case that every time the tide comes in more pressure is put on the dike because the force of the tide is eroding its base
4020673 thank goodness the old aboiteau that this one was supposed to replace held if it hadnt hundreds of acres of valuable farmland and much of the sod farm behind us here would have been under salt water when the tides came in if that had happened a lot of good farmland would have been made useless
4020674 and that is going to be important because with global warming the tides are going to involve more water which means the tides will be higher and there will be more pressure on these dikes
4020675 in fact there could be enough water to cover the train tracks the trans canada highway if they arent maintained and strengthened nova scotia could become an island
4020676 they may know about it but i believe this disaster here really shows the province no longer has the expertise to maintain the dike system
4020677 the federal government pulled out years ago and left it to the province i checked with the federal agriculture department and they tell me they no longer have anyone on staff with the expertise to maintain the dikes and i think the failure of this aboiteau shows the province has lost its expertise as well
4020678 we need to get that expertise back at both the federal and provincial level because if we dont this province will become an island and thousands of acres of much needed farmland will be lost to the salt water
4020679 we need to get it back too because i suspect it will cost millions to upgrade these dikes
4020680 this truly is the most important issue that has come across my table in a while the federal government has to be involved because new brunswick will be facing the same problem
4020681 i believe they need to join forces initially to do a study to find out exactly what the state of these dikes are and what needs to be done to upgrade them to meet the challenges that will be caused by global warming
4020682 they must then work together to ensure these dikes will continue to do the job they were intended to do
4020683 we were no longer able to burn our rubbish so we thought the best policy was not to produce any in the first place
4020684 i was working when the scheme started and found myself spending my lunch break dealing with our rubbish
4020685 it took ages to sort everything into different types but it comes naturally now
4020686 some of the plans they are making will have a major impact on the lives of thousands of people who live in the area
4020687 im involved because as one of the churches here in the delta were very concerned about our members and the whole community
4020688 i think the peripheral canal will be a disaster for the delta long term and im going to fight them
4020689 im presenting that as the view that i think other people should hold
4020690 theyre trying to put out a rational plan that doesnt hurt agriculture and restores some of the fish habitat weve lost i dont see anything wrong in that
4020691 weve got people in the delta who farm they fish they play and they need to be included
4020692 its rather presumptuous that this thing is moving as rapidly as it is
4020693 i hope people dont accept it and dont allow them on their property

4020777 a recent media report suggested that 15 per cent of all zinc miners are operating at a loss at current metal prices
4020778 we remain well positioned to ride out this part of the cycle and expect lead and zinc prices to regain long term levels in the coming months
4020779 metal commodity prices including lead and zinc have retreated significantly in the last few weeks and months causing the industry to dramatically reassess current and future business plans

4020819 there was a time there where i thought everything was against me
4020820 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4020821 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4020822 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4020823 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4020824 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4020825 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4020826 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4020827 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4020828 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot
4020829 its just like the 1990s when we spent nights on the streets shouting at the top of our voices
4020830 put em in your mouth and suck em and suck em
4020831 what combination of natural and paid search will deliver the optimal mix of traffic and sales
4020832 if it sounds to good to be true it probably is
4020833 its ridiculous how many times ive got to see your ugly face
4020834 we throw out our food after more than four hours because company policy dictates that we have to even though theyre still great to eat
4020835 it is the chinese that we are offending if we were making fun of you we would have pulled up our mouths and eyes pinched our noses put sausages in our lips stuck two basketballs under our jerseys and wore a skirt that would fit an 8 year old
4020836 georgia is just one state let me know when they get as far north as washington dc oh and dont mess with texas heh heh heh
4020837 it has officially been one week since brett favre became a jet
4020838 it is continuing hopefully not for as long as the speculation about frank
4020839 weve still got a few days left of the window and hopefully well get a result
4020840 we are not contemplating his departure robi will continue with us
4020841 since i was a teenager ive been involved in anti fascist campaigning so ive put up with day to day political jibes ive been on marches and had things shouted at me but never anything as serious as this
4020842 ive obviously had to take it very seriously because of my family they said they were going to shoot me and have identified what gun theyre going to use so it shows they know what theyre talking about for people who know redwatch when they do identify you you usually become a victim of violence
4020843 we are investigating a threat to kill recently made on a website
4020844 for many companies and government agencies correspondence is the face of the organization whether its a welcome letter to a new customer a bill for an insurance premium or a summary of benefits or services document based communications correspondence serve as one of the most important and costly vehicles for communicating with customers and citizens
4020845 sometimes theres up to 80 or 100 people swimming in it on rafts and all sorts theyve set fire to it its like a bombsite
4020846 where are the councillors who were happily posing for photos not long ago by day sapphire point is like a ghost town with somebody appearing now and then but in the evening the place comes alive kids swarm all over the site with security non existent and dont even mention phoning the police we now have a new swimming pool where the baths were with youths swimming in the marina at any given time
4020847 open sewers unflagged streets overflowing middens and the offensive waste from common toilets which polluted the courts between the back to back houses
4020848 teach them to be good ones and good wives to sanctify their family and their homes
4020849 the canonisation process that the church uses is very lengthy you have to look at the things the person did in their lifetime if they wrote anything you have to look at that to make sure the writings are free of doctrinal error
4020850 she was different because she brought people out of the convents to work for a living something that wasnt common at the time
4020851 he has not given us the choice to have a say in the matter im not a smoker myself but the smoking ban is killing the trade he is only welcome back to the pub if he helps put it back to how it was before
4020852 that is tragic news let me get one thing clear i have never set foot in the prince of orange for eight or nine years so its nothing to do with me as a regular i suspect its a stunt on the part of those who are opposed to the smoking ban the majority of people who i know object to smoky atmospheres in pubs
4020853 the people that live in the area since the smoking ban came in have really suffered elderly people find it very offensive when theyre sat in their gardens and hear people effing and blinding not always in aggression but they do find it very very offensive
4020854 beer gardens have been a problem since the smoking ban obviously theyre being used differently and we are looking at them differently now
4020855 ive been round to see a couple of the neighbours and given them letters explaining if theyve got any problems please ring me
4020856 i started having contractions the day before my sister anita took me to tameside hospital and evie arrived at 12 30am she was actually 11 days overdue and was due on 27 july me and my partner lee downey arent really that superstitious but the fact that she was born on 08 08 08 and weighed 8lbs 8oz does make you think whether it all has a special meaning everyone was saying how special the day was and for the chinese its a very lucky birthday what with all the eights we believe no other baby in tameside and possibly in the country was born on the same day with that weight maybe she will bring us some luck too
4020857 tesco are trying to pull the wool over our eyes with this ridiculous car park but we musnt lose sight of what theyre really after it may even be a ruse to force through this enlarged shopping area
4020858 armentieres square will be completely overshadowed by a fortress like structure
4020859 there is an empty space at the top table what we have created in stalybridge is a destination they park they shop at tesco and they leave we dont want that entrenching anymore
4020860 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
4020861 nevertheless the green party of colorado is not in any way associated with recreate 68

4020908 the recordable cerebral activity readiness potential rp that precedes a freely voluntary fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the reportable time w for appearance of the subjective experience of wanting or intending to act the onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act
4020909 recent findings suggest that the conscious experience of intending to act arises from preparation for action in frontal and parietal brain areas intentional actions also involve a strong sense of agency a sense of controlling events in the external world both intention and agency result from the brain processes for predictive motor control not merely from retrospective inference
4020910 the binding problem is a genuine problem for neuroscience however readers should be alert to the way the problem is presented in horgans book the binding problem the humpty dumpty dilemma to use my term remains very much unsolved 1999 p 43 horgans formulation of the bindingproblem suffers from the common flaw of assuming that all neural discriminations must end up united in a single representational space in the mind brain as philosophers like dennett frequently point out incautious formulations of the bindingproblem often presuppose that there must be some single representational space in the brain smaller than the whole brain where something like horgans humpty dumpty comes together again see dennett 1991 p 357 for horgan binding is a matter of construct ing pictures of the world from many disparate pieces 1999 p 43

4020918 pingpong doesnt require major muscular development but rather speed and fine tuned skills
4020919 it demands a more delicate kind of mastery than large field sports or body contact sports

4021077 non siamo mai cambiati aggiunge del colle nel modo di affrontare le realta del mondo con spirito di cristiani eppure di tanto in tanto arrivano lettere siete cattocomunisti perche perche critichiamo lattuale governo come abbiamo fatto con tutti i governi anche democristiani quando ci sembrava giusto e cristiano farlo
4021078 per fortuna aggiunge giovanardi gli argomenti usati e le immagini evocate si squalificano da sole mentre rimane il rammarico che un settimanale che entra in tutte le parrocchie italiane tenti di coinvolgere una parte del mondo cattolico in una campagna connotata da pregiudizi e livore ideologico senza precedenti

4021086 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4021087 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4021088 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
4021089 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4021090 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4021091 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4021092 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain back in washington mccain opposed a requirement that the government buy american made motorcycles and he said all buy american provisions were quote disgraceful surprised you shouldnt be this is the same john mccain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship american jobs overseas its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop john mccain from shipping our jobs overseas
4021093 the worst most disgraceful aspect of the legislative process in washington i can not be more strong in my views without using four letter words its crazy for us because ball bearings are made in a certain state to somehow prevent the united states defense department from purchasing ball bearings if they meet quality standards from our allies
4021094 lastly i am also disappointed that the bill once again this year contains a department wide buy america requirement and specific language directing the secret service to purchase american made motorcycles i firmly object to all buy america restrictions as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy
4021095 furthermore as a fiscal conservative i want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a buy american restriction that cannot be guaranteed

4021117 karenanya mereka berpendapat bahwa kesepakatan yang berdasarkan nasionalisme adalah ibu kota yang menyamakan semua agama dan keyakinan merupakan satu hal mendasar sebagai keharusan untuk menjaga kesatuan negeri berdasarkan asas yang baru
4021118 tidak ada halangan bagi kami agar kharthoum bersifat nasionalisme akan tetapi dengan syarat ibu kota itu harus bersifat sekuler yakni agama dipisahkan dari negara dan setiap warga negara bisa melakukan apa yang dia inginkan dengan syarat tidak melanggar kebebasan orang lain
4021119 kami tidak mendengar hal itu diawalnya dan kami juga tidak percaya hal ini akan terjadi di akhir pihak yang mendukung pemberontak dan menyeru pemberontak kepada gagasan ini membawa bakteri jahat yang tujuan akhirnya bukan hanya pemisahan selatan tujuannya tidak lain adalah terpecah belahnya sudan pertanyaan yang harus diajukan kepada igad dan mediator adalah beri kami satu contoh saja sebuah negara di dunia sepanjang sejarah yang memiliki dua militer dan kami ingin mereka menjawab dalam term realita negara mereka sendiri apakah mereka memiliki dua militer akankah keamanan nasional negara manapun mengijinkan hal ini
4021120 bahwa jika kedua pihak yang berselisih gagal mencapai kesepakatan damai maka masih ada sejumlah sarana
4021121 tidak ada jalan dihadapan masyarakat dunia kecuali melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap beberapa pejabat sudan secara kriminal atas kejahatan yang dilakukan dahulu dan mengajukannya ke mahkamah icc
4021122 bahwa jika terjadi pemisahan maka utang akan menjadi tanggungan pemerintah sudan bukan menjadi tanggungan pemerintahan selatan
4021123 sesungguhnya kesepakatan damai yang diharapkan bertujuan terbentuknya pengaturan pemisahan selatan sudan secara damai dan yang disepakati
4021124 sesungguhnya pemberian bagian kepada setiap wilayah atas kekayaannya mungkin untuk diimplementasikan di masa datang terhadap setiap wilayah sudan khususnya yang mengalami marjinalisasi secara politik dan ekonomi seperti darfur dan sudan timur
4021125 demokrasi desentralisasi multi kultural multi etnis multi agama dan keyakinan dan multi bahasa negara
4021126 spla tidak akan melanjutkan keikutsertaan di dalam pemerintahan persatuan nasional selama belum ditentukan jadual waktu bagi penyelesaian masalah yang ada khususnya masalah abyei
4021127 setelah hari tersebut ditetapkannya amandemen maka sanksi tidak mencakup aktivitas bisnis di sudan selatan nuba mountain blue nile abyei darfur dan daerah daerah termarjinalisasi di kharthoum dan sekitarnya
4021128 bahwa kedua gerakan meingininkan pengaturan keamanan seperti yang terjadi antara pemerintah sudan dengan spla trhadap kondisi darfur ini sebagai oenegasan bahwa kedua gerakan slm a dan jem ingin menuntut penerapan teks naivasha seputar pengaturan keamanan terhadap darfur

4021134 siapapun orang amerika yang peduli terhadap tanda tanda politik mengetahui bahwa as tidak berperang melawan iraq demi demokrasi karena demokrasi tidak ada di dunia arab as juga tidak berperang demi keluarga kerajaan di kuwait as pergi berperang untuk menghentikan iraq atas kontrol terhadap satu sumber yang merupakan darah bagi industri dan yang menentukan hidup matinya perekonomian

4021140 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4021141 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were

4021151 there are two types of people i cant stand those who are intolerant of people from other races cultures or religions and the the dutch
4021152 bearing in mind market conditions and the fact that the cancellation rate increased to unprecedented levels towards the end of the financial year we consider this to be a satisfactory performance
4021153 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day
4021154 im not getting into that off limits not talking good try but i saw it coming
4021155 i will be putting pen to paper at some point yes
4021156 they will be an attempt to put in a longer term historical perspective the events of more than 33 years of public life
4021157 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally
4021158 in the end all of us in public life will be judged by history and im no different from anybody else
4021159 the prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirling around each other at incredible speed these tiny bodies are governed by precise laws and these laws hold true throughout the material world science tells us so we have no reason to doubt it when however the perfectly logical assumption is suggested that underneath the material world and life as we see it there is an all powerful guiding creative intelligence right there our perverse streak comes to the surface and we laboriously set out to convince ourselves it isnt so
4021160 ha ha ha what in physics are you reading about
4021161 quantum theory all about how the laws of the physical universe on the microscopic scale like atoms and molecules and electrons and stuff and the laws of the physical universe on the macroscopic scale like the forces between galaxies and stuff dont really line up
4021162 thats what they used to think but now theyve discovered that there are some things that dont line up like the laws that govern how the molecules in that table interact with each other dont seem to quite cover the way galaxies and stuff in space interact with each other
4021163 weird you know i always thought that was wild the way a scientist just says this is the new fact and we all just go oh well hes a scientist so that must be the way it is i mean like that table it looks like its not moving but some guy in a lab coat says im a physicist and i know about this and says that at a microscopic level which we cant see there are electrons and junk flying around and so in a whole other way the table actually is moving even though it looks like its not even though i cant see the electrons and all but dr physics says theyre there so we all go ok
4021164 i guess you have to start from a basic assumption that some people have studied or seen something and theyre telling you the truth i guess
4021165 well of course otherwise how could you ever learn anything
4021166 well the idea that if you have a problem that you cant beat on your own and admit that and then decide to follow a sort of spiritual path and follow the recipe that this book lays out you can have some sort of spiritual awakening and connect with a higher power that there are spiritual forces that you can tap into which will help you with the problem you cant beat on your own
4021167 how can there be spiritual laws i mean outside of poetry or something theres no real evidence for that at all
4021168 well the people who wrote this book claim first hand experience they say that they didnt make this up out of their heads they figured it out from trying different things and getting information from a bunch of different sources doctors other people who had the same problem some religious people
4021169 i know but ive met some people who tried what the book said to do and they claim that it worked for them
4021170 thats still just nuts people who believe in any of that spiritual crap are just kidding themselves if you cant point to hard evidence for something then
4021171 do you have the balls it takes to go through several couple devious levels and avoid awesome explosion
4021172 i died a few times where are my explosions more irritating than iwbtg
4021173 at school it was the worst that was the worst pain i had
4021174 i was bullied quite a lot by other pupils even by a teacher i was bullied quite severely
4021175 i wouldnt eat at school in the end i went in to school for my exams and came home
4021176 when people called me fat it would make me eat more it didnt spur me on to lose weight
4021177 i was at a family party and a family friend had lost 2st 7lbs dieting and that spurred me on
4021178 also i was in a clothes store and that was the only store i would go in because i knew they stocked larger sizes
4021179 their larger size was too tight and i thought im either going to have to have clothes specially made or im going to get stuck in the house constantly and i wont be able to go out and enjoy things with friends
4021180 the hardest part for me wasnt actually giving up the food it was admitting i had a problem and going along to the group
4021181 you think about tv shows you see and its all a joke or its full of older women talking about diets and things you can and cant have
4021182 you gradually start off following the plan you fit five minutes of exercise in whenever you like through the day
4021183 you build that up over time and now i walk five miles a night with my mum
4021184 my confidence and self esteem has gone way up before it was nonexistent
4021185 now ill go out i feel like nothing holds me back i go on nice holidays i travel by myself

4021190 my characters really in a state of arrested development which i see all the time
4021191 people dont want to grow up so its part of the humor that my character could be 20 she could be 30 she could be 40 and shes in her clothes from when she was in seventh grade and thinks that thats hot we see it all the time we see it in the tabloids people not dressing their ages and my character loves that and looks up to those people
4021192 i prefer that to playing close to myself it just feels more fun to me and freeing i could really relate to the dysfunctional family i liked that my character kath is positive strong shes spent her whole life raising her daughter and now shes got the daughter out of the house and she wants to move on focus on herself and her dating life and her figure and her diet and shes ready to go for it but the daughter moves back in

4021200 i was really quite shocked and saddened by what the prince had to say it was really rather ill informed and very negative
4021201 and im saddened that the prince of wales who is in a leadership role and able to solve some of the problems he identifies by bringing scientists technicians and agricultural and climate change experts together instead tried to blame the problems of the planet on a technology he clearly does not understand
4021202 he has a lot of understandable concerns about the way the planet is going but it would be good to see him looking broadly and objectively at how those concerns can be addressed and leading a constructive debate rather than dismiss something out of hand that we need to keep the door open on
4021203 gm is not a silver bullet but it is one of many things we need to look at to produce sustainable crops in the future obviously we have to take cautious rational decisions in developing that technology

4021228 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4021229 we agreed it would be very good for us and the industry
4021230 diners bowling alleys and trailer parks chasing the american dream in postwar consumer culture
4021231 st louis milwaukee cleveland these were the real bowling centers in post world war ii society
4021232 the midwest in general and individual working class cities were really the ones that supported the bowling industry
4021233 bowling is something that really resonated with st louisans they could see a lot of their own history in the bowling museum im not sure that can happen in arlington texas
4021234 it works every time no singer wants to listen to someone else sing their hit songs
4021235 clearly the players themselves are going to be out to prove a point and were the first one in their sights
4021236 we expect them to come out firing but that would have been the case anyway
4021237 obviously they are a very dangerous back three jared payne full back is one of the form players in the first two rounds and we know what fetuu vainikolo and rene ranger can do when given time and space
4021238 inevitably though you dont want to be playing rugby inside your own quarter so there needs to be some kicking for position on the field and well have to make sure our kicks are effective so that we can get a good kick chase in
4021239 weve done some research on them and theyre a good side but we feel there are a couple of areas where we can attack them in and weve been altering our tactics to suit
4021240 dans clearly played with northland before so he brings us some information about them and an understanding about how they play
4021241 hes also very adept at attacking the line and he was the incumbent super 14 pivot so its only now hes been able to make it back from injury
4021242 its something that we and the wru have got to consider
4021243 people say it cant work here but they said that in australia and look at how its taken off there
4021244 when i was back in new zealand they were talking about the lack of depth and the number of new zealand players that have left the country
4021245 i said to them imagine only having four super 14 teams and seven of the players in each team being foreigners thats what i have got to select the welsh team from
4021246 place our world cup under 20 players with it for two years somebody like our talented young outside half david flannagan for example would be a prime example because he could play week in week out
4021247 but we have worked hard to be competitive at european level with four teams
4021248 henk h tte hier wohnen sollen mit riet und mit kindern
4021249 we strive to make more products as green as possible and to proactively set up and expand a phone recycling system
4021250 its very evident you can see that so its definitely something that weve got to push through right now
4021251 if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts ive got to try to get to the bottom of it i didnt sign a one year deal im looking more for the long term rather than a quick fix
4021252 were going to get this last opinion on it and he can be a guy who can possibly play very little or not at all
4021253 he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately and so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4021254 that way i can be on a long play drive and be out there for eight nine 10 plays is my goal
4021255 so im just like ooooohh and the wind wasnt even blowing

4021277 the activists were disenchanted with the polls because the polls showed the electorate was disenchanted with them the left preferred to believe that they alone knew what the electorate wanted and certainly what was good for the public which they saw as a strengthened diet of state nationalisation intervention and controls over industry and the lives of ordinary people together with fiscal punishment for anyone who had the impertinence to pursue success in the private sector

4021282 if the economy remains robust on long island this population will continue to expand
4021283 what it says is there are going to be more people who belong to minority groups looking for housing on long island and basically thats going to create pressure to desegregate predominantly white areas can ethnic minority groups translate their greater numbers into greater political and legal power to challenge systemic discrimination in housing
4021284 what long islanders have to realize is that change is coming rather than being resistant to it we have to make it work as smoothly as possible so the economy and the social fabric benefits
4021285 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

4021293 i think its something thats getting more and more prevalent
4021294 i think were getting to the point where the word retard or retarded is used to describe anything undesirable or anything stupid
4021295 sometimes i think the word has almost lost its meaning
4021296 i hear a lot of teenagers using the word now like they dont know at all what it means
4021297 the great disappointment from our point of view is that the movie made it this far without this issue even coming up
4021298 were not making a play for pity were not making a play to be the language police but as long as you perpetuate that stereotype it has a very damaging effect on people with intellectual disabilities
4021299 i hear the word retarded its basically like putting people down
4021300 ive felt that way when i was called retarded i just wasnt motivated it hurts my feelings very deeply

4021321 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4021322 i felt my performance was exceptional but ive had better days i felt i should have had six or seven points for my body shots but theyre not scoring body shots you might as well do fencing not boxing if theyre going to do that
4021323 it was a horrible fight but the build up was so long and im just glad i got rid of this pressure
4021324 to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4021325 the state party should ensure that its powers to protect information genuinely related to matters of national security are narrowly utilised and limited to instances where the release of such information would be harmful to national security
4021326 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indir ectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts

4021328 matt mason has become an integral part of our squad since arriving in 2002 on the field he has had a tough 18 months but is now playing regularly with the first xi
4021329 he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4021330 over the last two seasons he has been mentoring our younger players on an informal basis and it is clear he has natural ability in this area
4021331 i am both proud and very excited to be given the opportunity to play and coach at the club next year
4021332 only three months ago i was wondering if i would ever play again so to be offered this combined role is more than i could ever have hoped for
4021333 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer and since returning to the first team i feel i proved that
4021334 coaching is something i am very passionate about and at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country
4021335 the opportunity to work with the senior players and continue the development of the younger bowlers is one i am relishing
4021336 obviously i would love to be part of the one dayers right now because i feel it would enhance my development
4021337 just the sheer one day game you have to add a slightly different thinking to your cricket
4021338 but i am going back to northants playing as much cricket as i can and looking forward to developing other areas of my game which excites me
4021339 i am looking forward to playing for northants until the end of the season
4021340 it definitely excites everyone because of the context of the game what its about
4021341 if you drop a catch you could lose everything if you take the catch you get everything its pretty black and white so its quite exciting
4021342 i think twenty20 is exciting it adds another dimension to cricket and more importantly i think it is getting more people involved in the game
4021343 there are spectators out there who might not have been interested in cricket its catching more people and more youngsters are getting involved in the game
4021344 thats probably the more important side more people are getting involved and that has a positive impact
4021345 reshaping the communications market by delivering the first enterprise grade sip pbx based on 100 sip and 100 open source software

4021350 it was a horrible fight but a few guys have been saying i had an easy draw but that lad alvarez was twice pan american champion and the cuban who is not here light heavyweight is the only division without a cuban representative is only not here because that lad knocked him out
4021351 ive been getting good luck messages all the time and that puts pressure on you and because the team has been so successful that puts pressure on you too its great youve got support but i dont want to let anyone down
4021352 there are world class boxers but there has only been one bout stopped on the 20 point outclassed rule
4021353 in the last round if it had been a normal competition i would have pulled back easily six or seven points with the body shots but here obviously they are not scoring body shots
4021354 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4021355 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4021356 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4021357 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4021358 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4021359 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4021360 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4021361 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4021362 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4021363 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4021364 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4021365 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4021366 bearing in mind market conditions and the fact that the cancellation rate increased to unprecedented levels towards the end of the financial year we consider this to be a satisfactory performance
4021367 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4021368 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4021369 we tore it down at the same time of the storm there were no lights the building was falling down and shook the ground and the entire fire department came around here and some people were scared
4021370 compared to some of the hoops the city makes others jump through theyre not making this guy do anything
4021371 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4021372 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4021373 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4021374 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4021375 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4021376 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4021377 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4021378 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4021379 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4021380 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4021381 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4021382 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4021383 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4021384 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4021385 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4021386 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4021387 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4021388 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4021389 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4021390 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4021391 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4021392 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4021393 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4021394 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4021395 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4021396 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4021397 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4021398 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4021399 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4021400 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4021401 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4021402 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4021403 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4021404 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4021405 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4021406 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4021407 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4021408 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4021409 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4021410 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4021411 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4021412 i think the administration has most of what they need
4021413 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly
4021414 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4021415 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4021416 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4021417 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4021418 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4021425 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4021426 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4021427 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4021428 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4021429 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4021430 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4021431 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4021432 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4021433 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4021434 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4021435 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4021436 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4021437 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4021438 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4021439 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4021440 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4021441 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4021442 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4021443 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4021444 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4021445 lo sentimos profundamente por la gente surosetia y los familiares de nuestras fuerzas de paz que murieron a manos de los agresores georgianos
4021446 la fuerzas rusas dejaron el puerto de poti esta ma ana

4021448 las informaciones sobre las acciones de las fuerzas armadas de georgia contra ciudadanos rusos residentes en osetia del sur y de nacionalidad oseta con el fin de eliminarlos asesin ndolos y causando graves da os contra su salud
4021449 optaron por poner unas estrellas de muestra para que la gente y la prensa pudiese saber c mo iba a quedar
4021450 es el primer esfuerzo a gran escala hasta ahora se han ido haciendo reparaciones peri dicas pero el problema es tan grande que supera al hollywood historic trust
4021451 cuando se dise se seleccion el color negro hoy no lo habr amos escogido pero es algo hist rico y no lo podemos cambiar absorbe calor lo que causa roturas aunque se limpia todas las noches se vuele a ensuciar enseguida
4021452 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4021453 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4021454 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4021455 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4021456 gori es patrullada por blindados rusos los edificios del ayuntamiento y el hospital no sufrieron da os
4021457 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4021458 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4021459 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4021460 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4021461 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4021462 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4021463 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4021464 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4021465 who are open to doing something on the production side
4021466 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4021467 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4021468 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4021471 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4021472 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4021473 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4021474 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4021475 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4021476 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4021477 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4021478 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4021479 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
4021480 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4021481 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
4021482 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
4021483 im really looking for the guy whos going to be the most consistent theyre all up and down im anxious to see how this plays out to me somebody needs to separate himself
4021484 we want to score a lot of points and we want to secure the football
4021485 its going to be the same with troy were going to be aggressive in everything we do offensively were not buttoning down anything ever
4021486 the whole thing is a little awkward for us and we would have preferred to do this in one announcement
4021487 the additional write downs here are all related to information we received from our accounting firm that says we need to look at our write down process differently nothing has happened to these securities in the last two weeks the applicable accounting has changed
4021488 as we get to year end we will see a lot of institutions take a lot of charges
4021489 the question to provident is have they taken all their medicine i wouldnt be surprised if they have to choke down a little more
4021490 the fortunate thing is they were advised prior to releasing their earnings
4021491 the disclosure points to a lapse in the companys risk management and control process
4021492 we have noted in the past that the company could face a credit cliff if it is downgraded to below investment grade
4021493 such a scenario could affect constellations ability to conduct its customer supply and global commodities businesses
4021494 we worked with them to convince them that howard county was an ideal location for a company on the move
4021495 they would raise cain if i tore up the grass and put in a garden
4021496 i think we need to start relocalizing our food supply
4021497 weve made our population vulnerable to interruptions in the food supply
4021498 i know my gardening neighbors better than my own neighbors
4021499 i think they should do it if they have some open space
4021500 we love the idea but we havent been able to find a suitable parcel
4021501 desde el 13 de julio hasta hoy hemos tenido 1 462 000 visitantes 410 000 personas se han concentrado ante las pantallas gigantes y 131 000 espectadores siguieron la inauguraci n a trav s de ellas esa noche en el templo de la tierra hubo hasta 21 000 visitantes de todo el mundo

4021503 i really want to make this position an educator for people
4021504 this was one recommendation of a 65 member transition team
4021505 this is really a recognition that local planning and land use has become very complex
4021506 ive talked to five or six out of the seven county council members and weve had bipartisan support
4021507 in principle it sounds like a good idea if done right
4021508 im interested in the job description we dont need a toothless tiger its just another layer of government
4021509 as an employee in the merit system i think that person would be less vulnerable to political pressure maybe we need some sort of critical areas czar
4021510 were all worried about critical areas but we want to be sure we have uniform enforcement
4021511 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered propped up on white pillows
4021512 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4021513 this will be a program that will allow the reduction of the carbon footprint and is one part of the citys overall program to increase energy efficiency
4021514 it is a very good scenario for all the parties involved
4021515 when they can make it happen help the community and still be responsible to their own stockholders its a good program for the banks
4021516 its a work in progress but were happy so far
4021517 the reduction in violent offenses specifically demonstrates a positive trend that we hope to continue
4021518 well have even better things to bring to the table
4021519 with the new police chief and the new attitude of zeroing in on crime where crime takes place it looks like progress is being made
4021520 we see the police on the street walking weve called the chief himself on a couple of things and he returned the phone calls hes been very proactive
4021521 if crime has dropped in annapolis and in public housing in particular that should be applauded on another hand we have to make sure the constitutional rights and civil rights that people enjoy are protected
4021522 its a combination of listening to the community new strategies fresh ideas and targeting these high crime areas
4021523 theyre doing a lot more enforcement of the smaller type things which lead to the bigger things on occasion
4021524 theres an increased vigilance on the part of an awful lot of people
4021525 when the anger on the part of the community boils up youre going to see a decrease people have had it theyre fed up
4021526 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4021527 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4021528 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4021529 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4021530 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4021531 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4021532 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4021533 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4021534 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4021535 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4021536 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4021537 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
4021538 i have to be careful what i wear into the supermarkets because you can become a piece of flesh where everybody wants to touch you
4021539 but mccune took his shirt off and it was ridiculous how he could look like that i called him hercules from that point on
4021540 i fueled military vehicles in kuwait and ive seen and heard some things that some people dont want to hear or see
4021541 when some players talk about how hot it is in practice sometimes i remember how hot it was in the desert its all a matter of how you want to look at things
4021542 i would never put a poison like that in my body we get drug tested all the time for steroids and ive never had a problem
4021543 i guess some of the guys thought i was a little crazy hauling around that rock but we didnt always have weights i wanted to keep alive my goal of getting to the nfl
4021544 he still has to learn about the game but he is going to be a dominating player one day
4021545 this body is gods gift and its a blessing to be here playing this game
4021546 unfortunately he got that knee hurt but hopefully he can come back healthy and show what hes got during the last two weeks football has to be easy with what he has been through in his life you dont have to tell him to go out and fight because he has been in wars and everything else hes a big picture guy and some of the guys go over and talk to him
4021547 you look at our kickoff team and say which guy do i have to block do i have to block antwan barnes or do i take out baltimore colts
4021548 from all over the darkened house childish laughter broke forth continuously
4021549 a smaller muzzle and much larger cranium finally created the new design

4021588 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus
4021589 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands
4021590 way too fast its a new generation and its now time to step aside
4021591 they did a great job im from the previous generation with alex popov
4021592 ive raced many times against alain but i didnt know he was in my league we met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good relationship im very happy with an ambassador like alain hes a great sportsman
4021593 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth final in the 100 freestyle
4021594 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching seoul watching matt biondi i got really inspired
4021595 i thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row but in 2005 i got really set back and started from zero
4021596 after eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds this is under my best i did in sydney its a big achievement for me personally im realizing it now because a few minutes ago i was very very disappointed because i was close to the bronze its weird but i was only thinking about ways to win the race and that was impossible with guys like eamon and bernard
4021597 im going to take my rest now i deserve my rest
4021598 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4021599 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4021600 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4021601 we have been working hard for eight years for this medal
4021602 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4021603 i never look at the scoreboard and think thats it
4021604 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4021605 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4021606 after so many years of competition especially in the all around there is no pressure from the outside anymore
4021607 you can think about the what if what if what if
4021608 i will try and do everything possible to get this resolved
4021609 it is what chelsea and peter kenyon want but there is no way they will pay what madrid want
4021610 both those contracts and discussions have been put on the shelf
4021611 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
4021612 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
4021613 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
4021614 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
4021615 the rest of the guys one day specialists have been busy back home and they might be a bit rusty to begin with but theyve got three warm up games to get it right so hopefully well all be alright for the start of the series
4021616 agreement is to bring in a strong and technological advanced operator to inject more efficiency into the operations of gt
4021617 technically involvement as its debt obligations exceed the value of its assets
4021618 the provisions will protect the purchaser and not the national interest
4021619 the government is confident that it is doing the right thing for the interest of ghana
4021620 i am afraid that my brother asamoah has not been well informed about the issue
4021621 social protection for all a prerequisite for consolidating democratic governance the role of trades unions
4021622 do not let us allow ourselves to be moved by whatever motives we have and we should not be hypocritical
4021623 while we are yet to attain this precondition we should remind ourselves that at the end of 2000 the national daily minimum wage was gh 30 which meant a monthly wage of gh 11 34 but today the minimum wage stands at gh 2 25 or monthly wage of gh 60 75 representing an increase of 750 per cent over the period
4021624 we seem not to appreciate how far we have come but we will all do well to remember that the current minimum wage could buy more of any basic necessities such as gari local rice cassava

4021635 pingpong doesnt require major muscular development but rather speed and fine tuned skills
4021636 it demands a more delicate kind of mastery than large field sports or body contact sports
4021637 i have a second cousin whos a nationally ranked pingpong player in china myself

voetballers het moeilijk met een vrouwelijke scheidsrechter in ieder geval trok leen martens vijf rode en een hele resem gele kaarten marcel dingemans had het op de website van kmsk over een

4021657 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
4021658 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future

4021661 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
4021662 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position

4021685 he can believe whatever he wants in his heart but on paper he cant convert
4021686 i announced this now because i was taken to state security and interrogated for hours
4021687 they kept asking me whether an organization had put me up to this or if i was doing it for money and fame
4021688 the real reason that peter gohary has the courage is because of muhammad hegazy
4021689 this is not about fame because i am already famous google me and you will see
4021690 i am so surprised by the administrative court verdict refusing the case of hegazy this is against all the international conventions as well as the egyptian constitution and islamic law which guarantee the freedom of belief
4021691 according to islamic law islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore muslims already practice full freedom of religion cannot return to an older belief christianity or judaism
4021692 christians are expected to be quiet because of their faith
4021693 police are at the door of the cathedral and they wont let me in that is a major reason behind my decision
4021694 so i dont know why he is doing this now unless he just wants fame and money and this timing is very bad for the country
4021695 when we pray we dont make it public we go into our room and pray to god in a personal manner
4021696 what they do and especially now with all the tensions between christians and muslims across the country is wrong
4021697 they have a right to believe whatever they want but to go public and try and get famous for their conversion is wrong and is probably not the best thing for a country struggling with our religious differences

4021730 why some senators are not honoring their signatures in the resolution is something for them to explain but whatever it is we respect their position on this
4021731 no longer interested to push for constitutional reforms for federalism especially for mindanao our expectations are that charter change towards federalism in mindanao will not take off soon
4021732 the fact remains that it was the senate that started pushing for the convening of congress into a constituent assembly not president arroyo
4021733 the president is merely being consistent with her campaign platform for constitutional reforms she believes that a federal setup is an aspiration of all mindanaoans her strong advocacy for it is not a subterfuge for an extension of her term resolution no 10 does not provide for such possibility
4021734 we cannot put the intelligence and communications on which our troops rely in jeopardy unfortunately as this report makes clear they would be at grave risk if fort monmouth were to close
4021735 if the work at fort monmouth werent important to the lives and effectiveness of our troops maybe they could justify this move but as is this is without justification

4021768 it means we can operate a full time equestrian facility
4021769 we know there are special needs children out there who could benefit from time outdoors with an animal we can help them using a dynamic mobile surface a horse
4021770 horses are experts in reading the body language of their herd
4021771 with a horse people who feel disempowered by whatever challenges can regain a sense of strength and power the gait of a horse is steady and can help the rider strengthen muscles riding helps with balance learning to direct a horse by voice or other communication can help a rider with his own ability and mobility issues
4021772 it helps him stay focused he really has come so far and done so much here he brings what he has learned in school here
4021773 this gives her self esteem and pride and encourages independence

4021817 he wont disrupt things with sir alex ferguson in charge
4021818 nor will the long servers like ryan giggs gary neville and paul scholes allow it they wouldnt stand for anything that would cause problems to one of the foundations of uniteds success
4021819 and i dont think berbatov himself would come in with anything other than full commitment and a desire to get to the very top
4021820 he had gone stale at spurs but this is his big chance and probably his last chance at a major opportunity like this hes not going to put that on the line
4021821 he wont get another chance to be a top player at a massive club so hell knuckle down and go along with whatever it is that makes united tick
4021822 it will be a huge fee that brings him to old trafford and there will be a lot of anticipation hes got to deliver
4021823 the price will be big and people will question it but i think he will relish the chance to show he is worth every penny he doesnt look the kind who would let anything faze him
4021824 i dont think sir alex ferguson would have been biting his nails about cover at full back or central defence or in midfield
4021825 but there may have been concerns about lack of firepower if wayne rooney and carlos tevez stay fit and you get cristiano ronaldo back soon then all well and good but if rooney or tevez is injured early on where do you go that would be a problem
4021826 you cant afford to take that chance so targeting a striker like berbatov was right and if he does come then i dont think united need any more than that to show they will be challenging again
4021827 the squad is stronger than 1999 and the one major signing would be enough
4021828 i dont think i would play ross again the way it ended felt so right i dont want to mess with it

4021841 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
4021842 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
4021843 having a best of breed provisioning and imaging solution was a great starting point but being a standalone product didnt maximize the potential of linmin bare metal provisioning now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
4021844 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system this is it application integration at its best

4021919 crude oil closed above 80 a barrel for the first time today breaking a longstanding psychological barrier just days after oil producers tried to bring prices down by promising to increase output
4021920 oil prices at 80 a barrel should be a source of happiness to crude oil producing countries but the opec is not happy abdalla el badri opec secretary general said in its first response to the current record prices that oil prices were high and would not last because they are not supported by oil market fundamentals
4021921 to listen to big oil executives theres no reason why a barrel of crude costs 80 no one has to wait at the gas pumps of the world there is no physical problem jeroen van der veer head of royal dutch shell recently told reporters in calgary theres a lot of psychology in the price

4021923 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline this chimera is being touted by president george w bush and other republican politicians including the partys presumptive presidential nominee senator john mccain of arizona to deflect blame for what its costing for a fill up to get around the fact that it would be a decade or more before any oil would be likely to flow a few partisan analysts have said that the cost of gasoline would fall right away they argue that the prospect of additional oil supply in the future would lead oil companies to produce more oil immediately because they would expect prices for crude to be lower later on well wouldnt that depend on whether a producer had the capacity to pump more oil today and whether it thought lifting the moratorium would add a significant amount of oil to future supply relative to future demand there are good reasons to question whether another 1 million or 2 million barrels of crude a day would make much difference in prices when world consumption is running at 85 million barrels a day about a fourth of all u s oil production is already coming from offshore wells primarily in the central and western portions of the gulf of mexico that arent covered by the moratorium

4021937 wait until they receive confirmed revenue figures before deciding on how best to meet the needs outlined by governor bill richardson in the upcoming special session of the new mexico legislature
4021938 in advance of the special session everybody is speculating about the specific impact the decline in oil and gas prices will have on projected revenues for the state of new mexico
4021939 the july revenue estimates were optimistic but a lot has happened to the price of oil and gas over the last two weeks
4021940 waiting until confirmed numbers are available probably late thursday or friday is the prudent thing to do before deciding how best to meet the needs of new mexicans

4021955 i would hope prosecutors would do a pretty exploratory review of cases while costley was in the homicide division to make sure that everything that is in the file that should have been turned over was in fact turned over to the defense
4021956 and i hope that any police officers involved in those cases given that police withheld information from miss costley in one of them will be asked whether they turned over everything to prosecutors
4021957 we will never be able to say with 100 percent certainty more than a decade later what exactly occurred but it is critically important in the interest of justice that we proceed with the new trial
4021958 if i dismiss this case it certainly would provide a shocking deterrent effect to the police department when it comes down to providing information to the state so that it can be properly disclosed to the defense
4021959 you would agree that forever now and today the noakes hill case would stand as a reason why the police ought to sit down with the states attorneys office and be sure absolutely positively sure that there are reports disclosed and shown it would ensure justice in this city for any other defendant that might be charged
4021960 it was very frustrating to the defense and i do believe they have done better
4021961 also the rules have recently changed which should make this sort of thing never happen again

4022046 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
4022047 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
4022048 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs
4022049 guter stil ist es souver n mit seinen fehlern umgehen zu k nnen das haben frauen wie jennifer lopez vorgemacht mit ihrem viel zu dicken arsch ich finde das nat rliche unzul ngliche viel aufreizender als das glatte

4022067 that is for me like for a footballer to play on wembley
4022068 its yankee stadium for baseball madison square garden in basketball new york knicks to play there
4022069 i mean its almost like a holy place that was really something what is inspiring me
4022070 a person that has been working for 30 years for this sport doesnt deserve this treatment
4022071 its something really bad from a human point of view that shows the type of people at the top of this organization
4022072 marty has made it clear that he will wait until after july 1 to evaluate all his options and make an informed decision at that time
4022073 plzen has made an aggressive offer but its just one of the offers he will be considering
4022074 it is by far the best victory ive ever had
4022075 the conditions were bad and as i was driving i thought if i win this it will be the best race ive ever done
4022076 on my last lap i could see the crowd starting to rise to their feet and i was just praying praying praying i could get the car round
4022077 it was so extreme out there i was having big problems with my visor i couldnt see a thing
4022078 its fantastic ive never lost the belief i have in me
4022079 this is a great day for myself and my family
4022080 edmonton is a great city and one that has embraced us in every way possible ive spent my entire career with the oilers and im thrilled about the direction we are heading in
4022081 shawn has proven himself as one of the premier players in the national hockey league and has been and will continue to be an integral part of our organization moving forward
4022082 by being proactive with this deal we avoid being in a situation where shawn could become an unrestricted free agent after next season and the unknown free agency can bring to the organization having him under contract long term is something that has been on our radar for a long time and we are extremely pleased to finalize this deal
4022083 i dont remember a tour as open as this with three riders within 10 seconds of each other and six riders within 50 seconds
4022084 its the closest tour ever isnt it i think it will probably go all the way to paris like that
4022085 its great for you guys watching but its a little bit anxious for us
4022086 i am not a time trial specialist even if having the yellow jersey gives you wings
4022087 with the team we have we can continue to be aggressive
4022088 we have a really strong team and that is what could be the key for us in the alps
4022089 there is a lot of suspense which is what organizers dream of
4022090 hes usually better than the rest of the guys in the top six
4022091 you make decisions based on whats happening in the football game
4022092 i have two really good quarterbacks its just not rocket science everybody seems to think that we have to have one player run out there every snap
4022093 you just have to have no animosity between people that are playing
4022094 if we can do that we can be very very successful
4022095 myself either i typically take care of the ball it just wasnt a winnipeg football team tonight
4022096 it was difficult especially the first half i think it was an extraordinary second half
4022097 thats what we wanted to be in the final but theres an adversary called germany that is going to be interesting
4022098 its not serious but hell miss the final because he has a pull
4022099 the team pushed on and i think we dominated the match im very happy about being in the final
4022100 it was their plan that they were going to make us tired so we couldnt make a fist of it in the second half
4022101 however we can be proud of reaching where we did and of coming third we faced really strong opposition tonight and they deserved to win

4022114 qualche utente si lamentato del fatto che il contatore sia inattendibile e non rispetti effettivamente il numero delle visite
4022115 poliedrica gran burlone e organizzatore di scherzi sincera affezionata dolce e coccolosa
4022116 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
4022117 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
4022118 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
4022119 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
4022120 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
4022121 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
4022122 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
4022123 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
4022124 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
4022125 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
4022126 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
4022127 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

4022131 se il blog fosse un paese tu saresti sicuramente la piazza del duomo
4022132 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
4022133 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
4022134 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice
4022135 quando vedi qualcuno che invidioso di te guardalo negli occhi e digli
4022136 niente che non fosse vero ho solo riscritto il tuo in maniera diversa
4022137 i figli sono strani un giorno sono piccoli triciclisti e un altro giorno jumbo jettano verso luniversit
4022138 sorridi anche se sei triste perch non c nulla di pi triste della tristezza di non poter sorridere
4022139 we needed to get him in there for some at bats he just went over and above for us tonight
4022140 his preparation every day is as if hes going to play he doesnt take anything for granted he may get a big at bat or be called on to play defence but hes always ready to go
4022141 you always have to be ready and prepared to play in the game no matter what
4022142 you have to come to ballpark expecting to play expecting to help the team
4022143 im making pitches guys are making plays behind me everything is working for us right now
4022144 we had the bases loaded probably one hit away from breaking it open but it didnt happen
4022145 i guess it was the miguel cairo show tonight huh
4022146 i felt more comfortable pitching to barajas than rolen i kind of pitched around him and got the matchup i wanted
4022147 then i made pitches sometimes you get the matchup you want and it doesnt work out i threw one of the better splits ive ever thrown to strike out barajas wish they all could be that good
4022148 for me 297 was a kind of wall so far after i passed that i thought 300 is the next wall to pass
4022149 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
4022150 lifestyles filled with hd media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4022151 dell welcomes the availability of intels xhci specification because it provides a single interface standard that will expedite the industry transition to next generation usb 3 0
4022152 this interface standard is important to ensure that our customers have interoperable usb 3 0 systems devices and software drivers
4022153 microsoft has developed driver support for the usb industry standard since its inception and is committed to supporting the latest hardware technologies on the windows platform
4022154 microsoft intends to deliver windows support for hardware that is compliant with the xhci specification this is a huge step forward in enabling the industry and our customers to easily connect superspeed usb devices to their pcs for exciting new functionality and usages

4022157 substantially undervalues unionbancal and is not in the best interests of unionbancals minority stockholders
4022158 does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position
4022159 we have been and remain willing to engage in discussions
4022160 slow turnover is making the market highly susceptible to moves of stock index futures
4022161 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus
4022162 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands
4022163 the reality is that since rays buyout there hasnt been a lot of interest it doesnt seem like someone in the nhl wants to give him a second chance right now
4022164 its a terrific offer from russia and weve been speaking to them for several weeks since the buyout
4022165 ive been talking to ray a lot over the last couple of months and i know hes taken a lot of steps to make changes
4022166 we were so happy to have sergei come in last season
4022167 the younger guys really look up to him i know myself i watched him with hawk eyes to absorb everything he did were really happy to have him back
4022168 now if we have a healthy captain chris clark and a healthy michael nylander i really think we have a better team than we had last year were excited
4022169 josh established himself as a key member of our defensive squad last season
4022170 his reliability and solid play made him one of our most improved players he is a young defenceman with a very good work ethic
4022171 now i know what tiger woods feels 98 per cent of the time when he gets on the greens so its a great feeling
4022172 it was definitely the best putting round ive ever had
4022173 conditions were brutal for the first 11 holes but i dug deep and managed to turn it around
4022174 we all grew up together and we all grew up playing against each other and we all made a pact together that we would all be here just to see it all fall into place and see it all happen is kind of crazy
4022175 i was a little nervous when they came back out but i always had that in mind that i want to be no 1
4022176 so it was great hearing my name and being the no 1 pick
4022177 im just blessed to be in that position right now because a lot of people arent and just knowing that we are a few pieces away from really contending as a team it just makes me happy
4022178 its part of the game all the players have got to hear this
4022179 not every time can you hear good things its normal
4022180 with a greater number of people attending the premises there is a significant likelihood of crime and antisocial behaviour increasing in the locality
4022181 in the opinion of the community safety group set to look at crime and anti social behaviour in st ives the town is unable to cope with an increase in the night time economy at the present time
4022182 he can go anywhere why not he really has extra speed he knows how to dribble and we always tell him he is so young he can learn everything and be one of the best players in the world no doubt
4022183 we had some good matches but the spaniards were constantly good throughout out the tournament and played at a very high level
4022184 i hope this is good for football as well as for spain because the best team won
4022185 this is not always the case we are doubly happy
4022186 it is the most important day in spanish football in many many years
4022187 we had a great tournament but made one mistake too many
4022188 we were lacking of power against a great spanish team we couldnt keep up with them
4022189 the first 10 minutes today we were quite nervous and germany was better
4022190 but from the shot on the post i saw we could win and that we could score any moment
4022191 lahm was in a better position but for a moment he relaxed and that was to my advantage
4022192 it was a little detail we have grown and can control these little details
4022193 winning four matches and now youre starting to challenge the federer i dont think
4022194 im playing semifinals but that doesnt mean that i have a chance there because the guy has won how many times already here
4022195 its just a little bit too difficult it would be for me to beat him
4022196 i was really nervous in the beginning because hes really uncomfortable for me
4022197 i lost to him four times i dont like to play against him because like i said he changes the rhythm
4022198 its more like a relief that i made it first time in my life the semifinals of wimbledon
4022199 it really means that i can play on this surface of course im happy but just its a different happiness
4022200 its not the same when youre 20 years old and the first time you make the semifinals you think you are flying
4022201 i want to climb back to the top 20 thats my goal right now
4022202 if youre not winning match es youre dropping in the ranking also i lost so many matches that ive been very close to winning and then just something slipped away thats it the momentum is gone and you lose the confidence
4022203 we are very excited to have created this limited edition for singapore
4022204 it commemorates an important milestone in racing history with the very first night race in singapore
4022205 singapore is one of the key important markets for tag heuer where the sales per capita is one of the highest in the world
4022206 build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door
4022207 having a child myself really puts things in perspective for me
4022208 these kids arent feeling great but i hope that the cup cheers them up for that one special moment and thats really what its all about
4022209 im not the sickest kid in the world but the other kids they must have really enjoyed it
4022210 mostly im going to brag that i got to meet danny cleary i got to touch the stanley cup
4022211 dan cleary has done a really wonderful thing coming here
4022212 these kids all need a little something to brighten their day
4022213 not only that this is not toronto this is not british columbia the cup has never been to newfoundland thats the thing i think it was my duty to bring it home
4022214 years down the road therell be trivia questions who was the first newfoundlander to win the cup what day did the cup come here
4022215 its impossible to explain what i felt in that moment
4022216 just very very happy to win this title for me it is a dream to play in this tournament but to win i never imagined something like this
4022217 rafa is a deserving champion he just played fantastic it was the worst opponent on the best court
4022218 hes still the best hes still five time champion here and i only have one so for me it is very very important
4022219 the judge says you brought it on yourself so you do not get extra damages
4022220 the judge said that you the rabobank team knew or should have known that he was not in mexico that seems to me like a serious finding
4022221 probably later on in life you know ill go that was a great match
4022222 but right now its not much of a how do you say a feel good thing
4022223 after five epic hours of truly agonizing drama nadal wins the greatest final ever
4022224 im happy the way i fought thats all i could really do
4022225 win a grand slam title away from your beloved clay
4022226 if i meet roger on hard courts its going to be very good news
4022227 ill take full responsibility because i picked the team and i sent the team out there in the first half
4022228 the team that went out there in the first half didnt perform to the level i want they couldnt pass the ball there was no communication there was nothing it was lifeless it was lacklustre ill take full responsibility for that because at halftime i made three substitutions and it was like night and day
4022229 the way it looked to me is that we could just go out there and go through the motions
4022230 nobody is safe at this football club theyve got to realize that if they get complacent i can cancel their contract tomorrow
4022231 i was marking him he was grabbing my arm and hes falling down and thats why i was frustrated because the way he went down i dont think it was a penalty at all i dont think anybody thought it was a penalty we end up losing 1 0 because of a bad goal
4022232 i was in mls for three years and i was excited to see those guys again
4022233 its always a challenge anytime youre taking a step up and playing a toronto or mls team or an exhibition against someone from overseas its fun its exciting and its a challenge you just test yourself and your team to see how well you can do
4022234 some of the lads saw it on the tv and i was definitely on side the officiating decided the game
4022235 he was right to have a go at me because i picked that team that played in the first half
4022236 he was ejected from the ground and that was wrong id like to meet the fan i want him to come and see me ill speak to him and ill make sure hes okay
4022237 im sorry that a penalty kick has decided this situation
4022238 over these last two years my italy also did something positive and one last game cant erase that
4022239 president abete met national team coach roberto donadoni at the federation headquarters and an assessment was made for the last two years and for the outcome of the european championship
4022240 while reiterating to donadoni the sincere personal respect and appreciation for the seriousness and quality commitment with which he carried out his job as coach of the national team president abete also told the coach of the federations decision that it considers its contractual relationship finished by natural expiration
4022241 they think a big guy cant move i can move when i need to
4022242 im high in the sky right now im just excited that these guys got a win
4022243 thats how we thrived all last year on big plays and we just waited for that moment
4022244 we came out and we fought hard and stuck in there and put up the w it feels good
4022245 when you have great effort like that we have three areas that we want to be successful in
4022246 we want to be successful in ball security and we tied them in that area we want to be successful in field position i think we won that one then we want to be successful in number of big plays and big play ratio and i think we had more big plays than they did as long as we do those three things we should be successful or be in a position to win games
4022247 we have to find a way to score majors and not just field goals
4022248 that was a disappointing part of the football game if we would get a few touchdowns the outcome might have been different
4022249 dont worry there was no quit out there we have a good solid team and a team of vets
4022250 ive always said you learn more from losing than winning so we can take this as a wake up call and set the pace we dont like to lose we dont play to lose we dont get paid to lose so were here to win
4022251 were giving ourselves chances and thats something we need to do
4022252 ive had a few hits to tie but never to win the game
4022253 i was kind of running away from the mob it was fun
4022254 were going to miss him obviously but weve got to pull along and i think we can do it
4022255 small ball is what we have to do when were given the chance when we do weve got to get those runs across
4022256 with all the injuries that we have hes going to go out and start again
4022257 in the past its been a strikeout or a pop up and then a ground ball for a double play
4022258 at least tonight we got the ground ball and got the run in every time we hit one thats a plus a big plus just put it in play
4022259 i rested all day yesterday and did treatment after warming up i felt like i was 25 maybe 30 per cent thats not good enough for a second round match
4022260 i guess not it did come into my mind today that it is my last chance to play here
4022261 the diagnosis was three to four weeks i should be fine
4022262 its overdue its about time this is the spanish team weve been waiting for
4022263 im going to celebrate like ive never celebrated before canada get ready here i come
4022264 i felt the game was really influential it brought the spanish community together but a lot of other people as well
4022265 for once we win something so lets enjoy it normally were not very lucky
4022266 weve been waiting for many years for this spain has always been an underachiever to see spain win its amazing
4022267 i feel totally exhausted it was time forty four years every day watching in anticipation but we had a better team spain all the way
4022268 it was his fault normally hes the best player in the world but today not good
4022269 today we need to celebrate with the spain guys im not happy with it but hey come on we need to do it
4022270 we had a lot of opportunities to win that game
4022271 you dont like to lose ballgames like that when you have the bases loaded and nobody out thats a tough loss for us hey we have to put it behind us
4022272 usually i have pretty good command i just couldnt find the strike zone
4022273 its hard when you put your team down five runs early
4022274 i had a good gameplan you just got to stick to it and i didnt bases loaded hes got to come to you youve got to make him come to you and i didnt
4022275 the only way we can correct that is to find out what those guys are thinking in those situations
4022276 some guys in that situation are trying to hit a fly ball as opposed to hitting the ball somewhere hard if you go up there and stay within yourself and try to make contact i think everything is going to work out for you
4022277 we were trying to get it down and away and it was more down and in
4022278 speedwise everything was fine instead of away it was in
4022279 to me those add on runs are what hurt you print
4022280 oh i went to the gym every day but i drank every night fighters never beat me but drugs and alcohol did
4022281 he could box he could brawl he could do it all
4022282 there isnt a team in the world that plays with the touch and precision that we do
4022283 we achieved this triumph and if we continue with the same work ethic well achieve more trophies
4022284 you won with such clarity and conviction you played a game that was spectacular and brilliant it was real football
4022285 we are at the start of the best times of football for the national team and for spanish sport you have given a great image of spain in europe and the world
4022286 they are tired which is logical since it has been hard work and an intense celebration
4022287 we started off rough we just reload regroup and keep coming at you if you aint ready to play four quarters you probably arent ready to play with us
4022288 we cant play any worse than weve played the last two weeks
4022289 were a veteran core but were just not playing well
4022290 were not making plays we expect so much out of each other were not playing the way were supposed to be playing and weve got to get it fixed
4022291 we kept hammering on the rock until it finally broke
4022292 we had turned it over a couple of times i just wanted to get a fresh start
4022293 i had no idea but at the same time i prepared myself like a starter all week
4022294 im just glad we fought harder it looked like we had a bit more left in the tank than they did thats what got us the victory
4022295 i started to settle down at the end of the first quarter
4022296 but after that it was dropped ball mistakes or too many men it was just something every time
4022297 well have to go back look at the flim and try to correct the things that we missed
4022298 it was a play that wasnt really in the game plan
4022299 its cool but this game was about much more than that it was about jamel richardson making great catches and danny desriveaux playing great the offensive line doing a great job and anthony playing his heart out
4022300 were not out of it its only two games but we need to get something going really fast
4022301 he stepped up and did good things again danny can play any position on our team now
4022302 itll be tough to sleep i visualize a lot and every one i thought of happened in the game for me to get 100 yards in montreal and my first td its a real high
4022303 we came up with a lot of new stuff this year and it takes a while for the defences to adjust
4022304 they did a good job in the second half they shut us down a bit so we needed to make some plays in the fourth quarter
4022305 at the tour you have to be wise and place your attacks well
4022306 its true that today was hard but not enough to put menchov or evans in difficulty
4022307 now its better to rest well for saturday and keep my energy for the time trial
4022308 im really happy to win a stage in my second tour appearance
4022309 he tried to always stay behind me and attack from behind but i was always very focused and he couldnt get away
4022310 they can take anything i have no worries about this
4022311 ill just take this as a bad week and go from there
4022312 i think the qualifying conflicts with school so i probably wont go to that
4022313 but hopefully ill make enough money this year to get exempt for next year
4022314 ill see how it goes im having a lot of fun playing good again so thats all im focusing on now
4022315 it had been a long time since i shot 14 under
4022316 with all the crap going on this and that my focus is here man
4022317 weve got a great team and we can go on a run here if we keep playing ball like were playing weve got the pitching and definitely the defence and hitting to do that
4022318 its nice to start playing the way we should be playing
4022319 we should be winning series at home and we need to have confidence and that feeling that when a team comes into our house theyre going to be lucky to take one
4022320 my windup has been a little different earlier this season opposed to last year and i just tried to get back to what that was and everything is starting to click
4022321 were working on things in the bullpen and getting it done
4022322 were going to have times like that i know theyve stood out around here more than most years but its going to happen to us again
4022323 i know its easy to start thinking here we go again but i dont see it that way i think these guys are off and rolling right now and hopefully we can keep it going in the same direction
4022324 their bullpen is outstanding and they got all good starters
4022325 the throw didnt take me that far off the bag
4022326 i think i was on top of the bag when i caught it obviously a big double play
4022327 i think its important for me to stand up to anti gay discrimination so that other gay and lesbian officers know that they can come out at work without fear of reprisal
4022328 hgtv highly values its editorial relationship with afterelton and the network always forwards on every request that is made to the talent at the time the afterelton interview request was made mikey v decided to decline the opportunity
4022329 i even asked her i said why arent i doing it im gay im open everybody knows about me but i guess she didnt want to go that route with me
4022330 my client has done absolutely nothing wrong nothing unethical nothing to bring discredit upon his police department except serve his community
4022331 give me all the money and no one gets hurt
4022332 my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
4022333 the only thing i have to say to the manager who comes after me is to please treat them the players well and let them do their job
4022334 ive never seen a person have to go through what he has had to go through
4022335 hes leaving as the best trainer of the national team ever
4022336 we were all pulling in the same direction without deviating from our path
4022337 we had a lot of confidence in the boss and i think that has been fundamental
4022338 we looked at a photo of the 1964 champions and we were proud and said these are our idols
4022339 now we are united with them we have done the same thing they did and we are proud that that photo could be made one more time after so many years
4022340 but im not going to sit here and say shes the favourite when im still in the tournament thats not me
4022341 were extremely motivated by each other win or loss on or off the court
4022342 i think the doubles gets us really amped for the singles and the next day were all tuned and ready to go
4022343 i hope i can do better when im playing her
4022344 and of course i also wish to win but for now i just want to simply keep my hope as simple as possible
4022345 i think shes doing a fabulous job and i dont think its luck
4022346 ive been working really hard lately im just waiting on the results to come
4022347 i deserve this because i dont think anyones been working harder than me except for maybe venus i mean that girl works even harder than i do
4022348 watching and pitching against most of these guys and then to have a chance to come here and be a part of it it speaks volumes
4022349 for me its been a joy to watch some of these guys throw this year im just trying to stay right with them and do my part you see it day after day with this staff youre seeing good pitches youre seeing outs and youre seeing good defence behind you
4022350 i was getting strikes and getting ahead of guys so that enabled me to throw different pitches in different counts and try and get them to chase
4022351 its a feather in their caps but they dont have to thank me
4022352 those are the guys who are throwing the pitches over the plate and doing all the hard work im proud of all those guys and its a tribute to themselves and the way they pushed each other to have that early season success
4022353 he didnt make too many mistakes but the mistakes that he did make he didnt get away with
4022354 in this league youve got to keep your mistakes to a minimum and when you dont throw 96 97 miles an hour those mistakes have a tendency to get hit more often than not
4022355 fuel prices are going up the cost of living is going up and yet our salaries have remained the same
4022356 the message we have from dietrich mateschitz is clear that for 2009 everything will remain stable not just in terms of employment but also in terms of the budget
4022357 then from 2010 we will see what happens at the moment the team is stable we are pushing hard taking one step at a time and we have improved our performance

4022361 fifteen years ago who would have thought good bikes bikes that are at the top of the world would come out of canada
4022362 when we announced our relationship with the team in the fall of 02 the overwhelming response was who theyd never heard of us now we feel weve got more of a target on our back
4022363 to have your product on global tv every day for a month is a phenomenal way to publicize it
4022364 is it necessary i dont think so weve built the company around this focus on engineering and making a better bike
4022365 i think what happens is people might be upset and say theyre not going into cycling and theyre not going to get a bike
4022366 if youre already into cycling youre upset with that and you dont want to see that but youre into cycling because you love it
4022367 drug scandal doesnt make it any less enjoyable its still a great fantastic super enjoyable sport the fact that theres some idiot doing drugs in it isnt going to decrease your enjoyment today and tomorrow
4022368 we approach it the same way youd approach the design of a formula one car
4022369 everything is secondary to the performance were spending a lot of time and money on the engineering side of it
4022370 you just take material out and then youre a rock star the real trick is taking the material out and not lose any stiffness thats where the engineers really earn their bread
4022371 i knew if i made a mistake in this fight i will lose the fight for sure if you go on the ground with this guy youre dead
4022372 hes one of the best guys in the world at jiu jitsu
4022373 obviously it wasnt the most exciting fight but lorenzos a good guy he understands
4022374 something happened with me mentally right there or physically or maybe both i was just dead in the second round just very very tired
4022375 we were in a bad spot and the kid got thrown to the wolves no doubt about it
4022376 i would like to thank all the teams who have expressed such sincere interest in my services
4022377 the numerous options provided to me were impressive and i have no doubt that each one presented a unique opportunity for me to finish my career in a terrific hockey environment
4022378 i spent a great deal of time yesterday reflecting upon the teams who stepped forward and the opportunities that each provided
4022379 unfortunately i am simply not close to being ready to make a decision about resuming my career at this time
4022380 mettre backtrack 3 sur une cl usb ou une carte sdhc
4022381 it is not catastrophic he qualified us two straight times for a major competition
4022382 i did not want emotion and passion to get the better of reason
4022383 everyone is fully aware that the french team must evolve we will see where things are in mid october but we have not asked him to sign a contract it is a moral contract
4022384 that has to change to reconcile him with the french fans
4022385 we apologize to the fans of the french team but the failure was collective and everyone must take their part of the blame
4022386 i back the decision taken by the president when you are in trouble the only answer is solidarity
4022387 he only has one mission now to concentrate on what happens on the field
4022388 now the communication has to be focused on the french team not personal viewpoints in my opinion this communication was sometimes disastrous aggressive and lacking clarity he has a few years of experience behind him and its up to him to show he can bounce back from this failure
4022389 if it was just vieira and sagnol that would have been worrying but that there was franck ribery karim benzema and hatem ben arfa proves something
4022390 especially the isolation of one village amongst hundreds of others
4022391 ryans signing is a great validation of the organizations plans and desires as we move forward
4022392 he fits our strategic plan of adding quality players with a warrior mentality
4022393 weve had some discussions obviously with tampa once they traded for his rights it should come as no surprise they were obviously aggressive in trying to get us to consider signing before tomorrow but i cant honestly say at this point whether we will or we wont
4022394 well continue to talk today things could heat up in a matter of hours but right now theres nothing imminent
4022395 after thinking about things for quite a long time and after listening to what bob had to say mats still has not made a decision on whether he will play next season
4022396 he knows that there was a wonderful opportunity in montreal and hes very appreciative of the way that bob handled the discussions over the past week
4022397 mats has not closed any doors and will simply listen to all the options that are presented to him over the next while
4022398 david mcnab and pat morris have worked diligently at this for well over a week and we remain optimistic that it will get done but there is not a deal yet
4022399 its the idea of putting together a young group of players that have a chance at becoming a bona fide contender
4022400 a player of blakes stature and pedigree and the incredible influence he has on young players its critical he understands the role and the direction were headed if he understands that and wants to be part of it we clearly welcome him back with open arms
4022401 someone was asking me how he makes these putts on the last hole its because he believes he can make it the crowd believes he can make it its all the right stuff going in the right direction
4022402 its nice to have that one time one week when people are pulling for you sometimes there is a feeling like you just cant miss
4022403 you dont do that around this golf course too often
4022404 glen abbey played about as easy as it could today the greens are soft the fairways are soft if you can hit it straight youre going to do ok
4022405 i drove the ball nice today and made some nice putts
4022406 and yesterday playing 15 holes my game was a little bit off my putter was off everything was just a little bit rusty it felt like
4022407 i definitely feel like i have my legs under me now and im ready to go
4022408 from the fairway you could get at these pins today
4022409 what hes done for canadian golf is wonderful and something to be very proud of
4022410 i know i have an uphill climb hes a great player
4022411 i use that example of the 17th hole at the presidents cup
4022412 i heard tv announcer johnny millers comment mike you dont even have to hit this putt its just going to be willed in print
4022413 i did say to him coming down 18 that i was sorry it wasnt his story that was going to be told
4022414 i did feel that but i wanted to win myself in this game you have to take your chances when you get them
4022415 obviously winning a major puts you in a special club
4022416 winning two of them puts you in a new club altogether
4022417 where does it rank in those probably not as high as some of the other ones
4022418 quite honestly im sure i surprised a lot of people
4022419 it took a lot of pressure off me it took a lot of stress off me the fact that i didnt play three practice rounds like normal for a major was a big bonus i was very fresh going into the weekend and this 36 holes was a real battle
4022420 i enjoyed the claret jug so much i didnt want to give it back
4022421 i walk away from here disappointed but with my head held high because i hung in there
4022422 padraig played brilliantly today even though he tried to let it get away in the middle of the round
4022423 he came back and performed brilliantly and he finished like a true champion
4022424 the team of stephanie rice bronte barratt kylie palmer and linda mckenzie blew away the previous record by 5 78 seconds in a time of 7 44 31
4022425 chiffres auxquels on sattendait et qui ne sont pas bons
4022426 les augmentations du cours des mati res premi res laffaiblissement du dollar
4022427 ce qui est important cest de se demander ce quil va se passer dans les mois qui viennent
4022428 in other markets im sure he could get more money
4022429 but he wants to be here he sat down with us we explained our vision of the team and the organization we look at vinny hes a guy that wants to live in tampa when hes done playing whenever that is we want to move him right into an adviser role or be an executive with us
4022430 we look at detroit and the way they handled steve yzerman and thats what we want to be doing
4022431 i think thats going to be more and more important with the cap you take the top six free agents everyone is going to offer them within a percentage amount of what theyll get someone who really has to get a player might go a little bit more but its going to be about where the player wants to play
4022432 prospal could have got more money other places but came back here
4022433 lecavalier could get way more money playing in certain other markets but wants to stay here its making the right choices and being good owners with the right management team
4022434 hopefully in june players are talking to their agents and saying you know what
4022435 i cant guarantee what exactly will happen but i guarantee well be in there in a shocking way
4022436 he was a former first overall pick as a player he was an unbelievably successful agent and hes very detailed orientated and very visionary
4022437 he was sitting down with len putting five and 10 year projections together
4022438 i mean i think its kind of up to jay
4022439 he is still today our general manager we did not hire brian as gm hes the vice president of hockey operations to help us design and build a great hockey organization
4022440 i think their step to toronto has helped strengthen that and i see the buffalo bills being in western new york for a long time
4022441 i dont think theres anyone that thinks negatively of the city of toronto its a great city
4022442 but this is about making sure that we keep the bills successful in western new york
4022443 would like to see the team stay in buffalo and were going to work very hard to make sure that it does
4022444 weve put a ton of emphasis on the no 5 program
4022445 its been a total team effort and casey has worked as hard as anyone to help us improve weve tested more than we ever have but the results just havent come
4022446 none of us casey included have been satisfied with the situation this season but hes confident there are other options out there for him in 2009 and we feel like hendrick motorsports will have some opportunities too
4022447 i know the effort has been there but we havent had the finishes to show for it
4022448 ive never tested this much or put more energy into racing but for whatever reason we just havent been able to make it click its certainly not for lack of dedication on anyones part
4022449 ill talk to people about opportunities and get my 2009 plans wrapped up soon but im also focused on the next 20 races and finishing 2008 on a positive note we ran well the second half last year and i know we can do it again i want to close this season the right way
4022450 im still world champion but its about three titles now that means everybody that fights me is extra motivated
4022451 i havent had a black eye for a long time now i really look like a fighter
4022452 they were both tired but wladimir has experience now then he came back with a second wind
4022453 i said thompson would be one of the most difficult fights we will have
4022454 he did what a great champion did he took advantage when i was vulnerable the only thing that hurts on me is my heart for losing
4022455 we will try to decide maybe in a couple of weeks
4022456 i didnt have the rhythm at the start but the jab got better each round
4022457 to have won the breeders cup classic in such a strong running winning the dubai world cup i think that international racing is going to be very strong in the future and they want curlin to be in the forefront of that movement
4022458 i fell out of love and just love being in love
4022459 i love you but im not in love with you
4022460 ive fallen out of love and just love being in love
4022461 naturally im very happy to pick up where i left off but picking up where i left off also means that the euros didnt go so great or i would still be on the beach in viareggio
4022462 were still the world cup champions weve got the team that won the club world cup ac milan we have a top under 23 squad and we are one of the favourites for the olympics
4022463 the world of italian football should hold its head high
4022464 a large number of players from the world cup stayed in the group and donadoni inserted some key new players
4022465 weve got to show a bit of daring in certain situations like in the semifinal with germany when i put four forwards on
4022466 were going to try and show some aggressive football right away
4022467 i would never have left if it wasnt in the middle of that situation
4022468 it was very tough to see my name and family members linked to those things at that time it wasnt possible to continue now the situation is different the discussion is open and weve gotten through that period
4022469 i received many offers from many different countries including for several national teams but you cant coach your own country to a world cup title and then go coach another country a year later
4022470 there were some very interesting proposals but at a certain point when the euros approached i felt a strong desire to return i felt in debt to the federation in some manner and this is my way to repay that debt
4022471 youve got to respect peoples opinions especially people as serious as those two
4022472 being the only canadian to win it is very special
4022473 i feel like ive achieved a lot in tennis i feel very fortunate to have won today and we feel like we had to play our best to do it that makes it more satisfying
4022474 wimbledon has the most history and tradition of any tournament
4022475 we focused really hard its one of those matches where you dont want to give an inch every game and point is tough
4022476 now i think were the no 1 team so far for the year which is very exciting too
4022477 hopefully we can relax and carry this through the rest of the season and play a little more relaxed and enjoy things a little more
4022478 it was a little bit of nerves out there and finally we broke through
4022479 they kept up their level in the second and we were fortunate to get a break
4022480 i thought we started playing better in the third and forth especially returning the whole match we served really well
4022481 weve added four people and every one of them has won a stanley cup
4022482 you cant just sit there and hope something changes from a natural evolution
4022483 we tried to address some things we think will make us even a better hockey team
4022484 ron and his staff worked very hard and did an outstanding job with us but sometimes the class needs another professor and the professor needs another class
4022485 and you dont let anybody off the hook i told the players were making a coaching change but you better look in the mirror because we had some players that didnt play enough good games in the playoffs
4022486 its not really much unlike what detroit had gone through
4022487 this was the first time detroit had gone to the final in six years i talked to wings gm kenny holland about this before what is it that gets your players back on top of doing the things they need to do to be successful
4022488 its a process that when you take a step back and look at it historically you understand it
4022489 and were not an old team weve gathered that experience and weve got guys that are very hungry and determined
4022490 sometimes you just need to adjust your approach a little bit and that in fact is what we did
4022491 we believe in our players a lot and we think theyre just coming into their prime
4022492 youre looking to add specific types of players weve tried to get danny boyle before we tried to get rob blake before this is very consistent
4022493 weve never altered our plan weve let our group grow and evolve and were very proud of our players but we also look at if theres something we can do to make our team better
4022494 i dont have a no 1 quarterback and a no 2
4022495 right now im comfortable with either guy being on the field
4022496 when the kerry joseph deal came to us i was surprised but it made us a better team
4022497 when the deal went down adam argos gm adam rita was all excited and i said yeah it just made us better coaches
4022498 you can never have enough depth at quarterback or any other position
4022499 you hope and pray you can stay healthy and things can go your way
4022500 just because you have more nitric oxide doesnt mean that you are going to be a better athlete
4022501 if you have all the nitric oxide you need and if you generate more from viagra its not clear what effect that would have
4022502 if you have more oxygen going to your muscles thats more energy and that makes you a better athlete
4022503 even if it only gives you a 10 per cent increase in peak athletes that is enough to win
4022504 viagra corrects problems in people who are in a challenged or diseased state
4022505 if you have some sort of illness from pollution then viagra might help
4022506 we see it as much as we see ibuprofen or aspirin or antibiotics that are not prohibited
4022507 athletes may be taking it but they may be taking it for non doping purposes
4022508 are athletes going to have to submit therapeutic use exemptions for viagra
4022509 it could be that athletes are taking viagra and then having vigorous sexual activity
4022510 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
4022511 given that there was something at stake and we beat them in their own house i think tensions were boiling over a little
4022512 were going to be happy with the performance but not the result but when youre playing against a higher tier theyre going to make you pay
4022513 although its five hours on an airplane it was like a derby game
4022514 you can sense it out there there was a rivalry between myself and their coach and its great i love all that especially when people bite
4022515 but its not as big a deal as everyone is making it out to be
4022516 after 15 years im not going to battle for a world championship
4022517 im unlikely to win another gp unless something remarkable happens this year i did have a world championship winning car i just didnt win it
4022518 my decision to retire was taken earlier in the year and is based on a desire to stop while i am still competitive and enjoying the immense challenge that grand prix driving represents i also have the desire to look for new challenges within the sport
4022519 the decision to make this announcement at the british gp should be an obvious one for all to understand as i have achieved two of my 13 f1 victories at silverstone and i am a member of the british racing drivers club which hosts this event
4022520 i was extremely nervous for the final and it didnt go as well as i would have liked
4022521 i got off to a bad start and i lost my focus still to win a medal at this event was a big accomplishment and getting the canadian record was something i thought would be possible going into this meet
4022522 it was awesome to get the medal i wasnt expecting it
4022523 my goal was to break the 1 03 barrier and i pretty much focused on my own lane and really couldnt see how close the race was
4022524 i am here really to fight for the podium but from the moment that youre involved in fighting for one of the top three spots its clear why not first
4022525 if in the end im second or third ill be satisfied too
4022526 its true that maybe some of the public some spectators have doubts but that has always existed and it always will
4022527 whats important is that we continue to train well and fight to win races and please our public and satisfy our team
4022528 bob loved life and was always a joy to be around
4022529 our thoughts and prayers go out to kay and the family
4022530 bob started every day with a smile and kept that same upbeat disposition no matter the circumstances
4022531 as someone who worked his way up the pro football ladder from the bottom he never forgot his roots he would treat ball boys and interns the same way he did coaches and players with respect appreciation and admiration
4022532 as bob would have wanted we will continue to do our best both on the field and off
4022533 as a result of his outstanding leadership i have every confidence that our staff our coaches and our players will continue to make us proud as we move forward
4022534 we have lost a dear friend in bob ackles a man who was passionate about many things not the least of which were family the b c lions football club and the canadian football league
4022535 but its not hard to imagine what hed want us all to do now honour our game and our league with our very best just like he did
4022536 i sacrificed a lot for this title and now im going to enjoy it
4022537 this years tour probably will go down as one of the cleanest on record
4022538 but i dont think one clean tour de france is going to change the image and the perception of cycling in a lot of peoples minds its going to take some time but its certainly a big step on the way
4022539 there is a genuine effort being made by everyone involved that it will be a clean tour
4022540 they aso are terrific organizers the best in the world make no mistake about it they have been doing it for a long time
4022541 for the first time ever the tour de france is not on the uci calendar and it saddens me theres no doubt about it
4022542 under the current circumstances i dont think i could accept an invitation from aso
4022543 not just to sit and watch the race if there was a possibility that it would lead to a calming of the situation and discussions i dont say negotiations then i would of course
4022544 it has given the message to these guys that its over
4022545 there is no point in trying to start fiddling with blood nowadays because youll be caught
4022546 weve seen information on a couple of riders its only a couple and weve discussed with the rider and the team the information weve seen and decisions have been taken
4022547 the uci is 100 per cent committed to cleaning the sport and having doping free cycling and aso need to recognize that they may do at the end of the tour
4022548 australia is a great cycling country in all the disciplines and it would be wonderful to see them win a tour de france
4022549 it would help the development and globalization of the sport its more important we have good stage winners and some young guys like the british rider mark cavendish come through
4022550 to have the lead all game long and then lose it at the end and then be able to fight back and get the lead again thats big for us
4022551 we lost a lot of games like that in the fourth quarter in the last few years it was nice to build some confidence and prove to this team that all we have to do is play 60 minutes
4022552 its a huge win because this is what they have to experience
4022553 they have to understand that when you are playing from behind that it is time to buckle up and get your act together to believe in one another and get it done and thats exactly what happened
4022554 we got the w thats what it is all about
4022555 the good teams are the ones that make the play at the end to win it they were the ones that made the play
4022556 but we certainly made a game of it hopefully it was a learning experience for us
4022557 when we are in a situation like that you know we are going to call 83s tuckers number weve done that a few times over their careers he caught the ball with one hand over his inside shoulder
4022558 if anything ive been more in form in the last two races than i ever have before
4022559 bang bang two penalties what can you do about that
4022560 im not putting all the pressure on myself saying ive got to do it all this weekend because thats not realistic
4022561 i mean for sure its a track where ferrari seems to excel they have done in the last couple of years but i think our car is good enough there
4022562 i have 10 races to go and im 10 points behind that aint nothin
4022563 after 15 years im not going to battle for a world championship
4022564 im unlikely to win another gp unless something remarkable happens this year i did have a world championship winning car i just didnt win it
4022565 my decision to retire was taken earlier in the year and is based on a desire to stop while i am still competitive and enjoying the immense challenge that grand prix driving represents i also have the desire to look for new challenges within the sport
4022566 the decision to make this announcement at the british gp should be an obvious one for all to understand as i have achieved two of my 13 f1 victories at silverstone and i am a member of the british racing drivers club which hosts this event
4022567 theres been a lot of interest and teams that have called and inquired have not put deals on the table that have been insulting in any regard in fact its pretty apparent that t j s value is very high
4022568 we are holding our cards close to the vest right now as we need to
4022569 theres a couple of bigs that we feel could step into an nba game and contribute theres also a couple of bigs that have great upside that would be considered longterm projects were intrigued by both those scenarios
4022570 theres also one or two wings that we feel could potentially step into an nba game right now
4022571 we are pleased to say that we are on schedule in all areas of race preparation
4022572 theres much to look forward to as we race toward this historic event in september with just three months to go well be revving up race preparations on all sides
4022573 we wanted to establish the run because theyre a very tough defence to get after
4022574 this is a big win for us but its just one win
4022575 weve got to hold on to this and keep going after it
4022576 it was good from the standpoint that it kept them on their heels and not on their toes
4022577 it makes my job a lot easier to have one play drives and keep watching his lumsdens back
4022578 it makes all the difference in the world when you can run the football
4022579 to me its a mental thing because if you can pound the football it takes a toll on the defence
4022580 a big part of it zone read is deception and thats something we tried to emphasize this week casey does a nice job of putting the football into the running back and it freezes the defence and when he pulls it out its tough for them to adjust
4022581 we have to come back down continue to work hard and come back and do it again
4022582 if we do were a better team than what you saw tonight
4022583 it doesnt matter whos calling the plays we arent performing
4022584 what can i do for my family with us 127 million that i cant do with 111 million
4022585 this is in line with what ive been saying the whole time you see players take max deals and they financially bind their teams i dont wanna be one of those players and three years down the road your team is strapped and cant do anything about it
4022586 it seems like this year more than any other year the bats are flying all over the place i cant remember a year where its been this bad
4022587 theres other ways you can help teams win as opposed to just getting a hit theres other things you can do
4022588 you want to play every day theres really not too many days youre going to be playing and you feel 100 per cent i take a lot of pride in playing every day
4022589 i think hes done a tremendous job i wouldnt say its a lot different
4022590 he expects you to work hard show up on time play hard thats all you can really ask for in a manager i think hes done a great job communicating with the players
4022591 we had it last year too it might not have been as loud it wasnt like mr t said theres no music
4022592 theres only so many things you can do youre not going to have jason giambi hit and run you know what i mean or sacrifice bunt what can you do
4022593 for a long time weve been the measuring stick you know other teams enjoy playing us
4022594 we go to places that normally have 20 000 now you have sellouts and people get into it and get excited players want to play well
4022595 you can write it however you want it im going to steal something
4022596 the crowd was awesome it was just nice to finally play a home game and to see the little kids in the stands cheering for you
4022597 they all know all our names it was just a perfect atmosphere
4022598 overall its a good result for us considering theyre probably one of the top three or four teams in the world right now
4022599 i think is a good springboard for us into the olympics
4022600 she has a skill that she is able to solve problems that other players dont even see
4022601 unfortunately for us it was three metres offside but im sure the referee found out later
4022602 it was good to see that they havent forgotten us they came back
4022603 again further proof that we see again the womens game in canada is very popular
4022604 we know theres people supporting us but we cant really feel it when were overseas and this makes it real for us
4022605 we see all these people supporting us and it really gives a boost
4022606 i basically went to head it on and she came with her foot and went right through my face there was blood everywhere
4022607 all in all a good test match not the most exciting performance from either of the teams for sure more solid than fantastic
4022608 we have to recognize the high standard of the spanish players they were playing well throughout the tournament and today they were excellent
4022609 we are disappointed that we didnt win but i think we can be satisfied with the tournament as a whole the team was performing very well over the 45 days we spent together we had a lot of fun but we were very ambitious
4022610 its true we lost we have to acknowledge the defeat but for us its going to be an incentive to work hard in the next two years in a number of areas so that we can make our target of playing for the world cup
4022611 well analyze the whole tournament and once weve gained distance and calmed down we can do that much better right now were full of emotion
4022612 weve not always been playing as well as we shouldve played we had some good matches but the spaniards were constantly good throughout the tournament and played at a very high level so they deserve to be the champions our players did their best
4022613 we wanted more but we could not deliver we were tired
4022614 we definitely have a lot of young really talented guys some of the best young guys in the peleton
4022615 my role is just to pass my experience on to them
4022616 theyve clearly got one of the best teams in terms of overall contenders
4022617 its a totally different team now different managers different riders
4022618 i think that fans can have faith in our team columbia ive got to practise that
4022619 weve also won more than any other team this year
4022620 its a pain in the butt but from what cyclings gone through its necessary
4022621 theres always going to be somebody out there in cycling in other sports in life
4022622 there are a few women who have broken that barrier but thats not the case everywhere
4022623 she needs more help than what she gets to help develop her fighters
4022624 this is a hell trip right here because the golden gloves for women is different
4022625 its held apart from the boys who do get funded
4022626 since the gloves are here and i dont have to spend the money ill fight
4022627 there are so many people worldwide that want to see changes
4022628 everywhere i take her she is fantastic she is really dependable and quick
4022629 he sat in the stroller on the bench with the nanny
4022630 so literally hes been around the game since he was nine months old
4022631 its a good thing that he comes from a basketball environment where people cared about the game and he went to practices and watched the hard work
4022632 obviously his mother didnt become an all american and an outstanding professional without working hard and having a great work ethic he grew up in that environment he knows what it takes
4022633 i dont play him anymore because were both competitive and if he beats me i say ill never live it down
4022634 weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4022635 it does have a bit of the feeling of a local fight
4022636 im cursed or whatever to be on the road at lot in my career but im fortunate that in montreal theyve received me well so im almost at home
4022637 howard otis they received me like one of their own i really enjoy that part of boxing
4022638 it was the toughest decision in my life hockey wise
4022639 it was a lot tougher than i thought it was going to be
4022640 russia is nothing new for me its close to the czech republic it would be different for american or canadian players but for me i enjoy it the people love hockey and i had a great time out there
4022641 i wanted to go home in three years so i was looking for a three year contract if i wanted to stay here
4022642 but it looks like with the new cba its tough for older guys to sign long term contracts because teams are worried youre going to get injured or retire and theyre stuck with the salary on the salary cap
4022643 so it was too tough for any team to sign me to a three year contract
4022644 but i didnt want to do a one year deal because i didnt want to go through the same thing again next summer because i really didnt enjoy this
4022645 i want to thank all the teams that still believed in me and still made an offer
4022646 edmonton was probably the biggest offer i got it was a great offer to be honest with you
4022647 i wish them good luck and thanks to gm kevin lowe and the new owner
4022648 im thankful for the three years i had in new york
4022649 they were great years i understand that im older and the team decided to go in a different direction because they couldnt get the deal done
4022650 i will never say one bad word against the rangers organization or glen they were great to me and im not lying when i say that its really how i feel they were always great to me
4022651 if i ever have a chance to talk to ted leonsis i would try to explain everything to him
4022652 i tried my best but it just didnt work its not like i didnt try it just didnt work he spent a lot of money to get me there to washington and for whatever reason i just didnt play the way they expected me to play
4022653 and i played with so many great players especially in pittsburgh with mario lemieux and ron francis and bryan trottier and paul coffey all those great players i had a chance to learn hockey from them i was very lucky
4022654 probably the luckiest year was when i was 18 years old and came to the pittsburgh penguins
4022655 its not only about winning the cup but its about the players that won the cup they players on that team worked so hard to win that cup when youre a young guy and you see how hard the older guys work you feel bad if you dont do that with them they taught me everything on the ice and off the ice
4022656 my lord tho i have not the honor of being personally known to you i yet venture to address you tho i cannot offer any other excuse for the liberty i take if the irresistible desire i feel of thus unknown paying my humble tribute at the shrine of genius be not deemd any apology
4022657 turn not from this address because the writer is anonymous
4022658 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
4022659 the women who ranged in age and social class may have been spurred on by bryons cultivated image as the brooding romantic hero who had suffered heartbreak in early life she added
4022660 why did my breast with rapture glow thy talents to admire why as i read my bosom felt enthusiastic fire
4022661 should curiosity prompt you and should you not be afraid of gratifying it by trusting yourself alone in the green park at seven oclock this evening you will see echo
4022662 if this evening proves inconvenient the same chance shall wait you tomorrow evening at the same hour
4022663 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
4022664 my lord you cannot retire to any part of the civilized globe where you will not be followed by the echoes of the worlds applause you must be satiated with the sound of public praise but you may yet endure it in the still small voice of a retired and nameless individual who has admired your splendid abilities from their very dawn
4022665 i mean if he wants to debate what our offer sheet did to them or to the salaries anytime
4022666 the reality is rick nashs contract a number of years ago patrice bergerons and ilya kovalchuks that sets the standard thats been going on for decades im sick and tired of it i know everybody in hockey is
4022667 you go right now from entry level to what used to be the third contract thanks to two offer sheets from kevin lowe
4022668 he had a deposition bearing down on him and a court date hearing bearing down on him
4022669 sometimes its helpful to have a sword hanging over ones head to get a bit of leverage
4022670 last year we removed his name from the historical guide but we could not declassify him as he remains the winner and only the uci can declassify someone
4022671 we reinstated him in our guide and added a line to say he had admitted doping but it is only a historical guide it has no official bearing
4022672 back in those days i was young making a lot of cash money and i was spending it as fast as i could get it
4022673 ive got god on my side i give 10 per cent to the church and i prosper
4022674 making history setting records whupping ass its been working out for me pretty good
4022675 hes come full circle as a person mainly as a person i think that really counts as an athlete
4022676 youve got to be mentally stable youve got to want to do something to get better and believe me its like his ability was in a box he was fighting just out of rawness anger maybe now he understands that he has a gift
4022677 hes actually an athlete and hes starting to understand his body more i think hes come a long way
4022678 im oblivious to everything i dont watch the news i dont read newspapers
4022679 all i do is play video games kick with my kids go to clubs train hard and fight
4022680 we actually turned down a million dollar role for wolverine to dothe ultimate fighter show
4022681 was it good business financially no but it was our integrity and our dedication to the ufc and we said wed do the show so we did it we passed on the movie did the show got over the show and now were ready to fight again
4022682 i bought the wfa basically just to get rampage jacksons contract
4022683 hes fought some of the biggest names in the business i always liked rampage i was always a fan of rampage and i felt he wasnt put in the right positions over in pride i thought he was a talented guy and had the potential to hold the title here some day
4022684 dan henderson and chuck have been fighting for a long time fought some really good guys the toughest guys forrest fought he lost to a lot of them
4022685 ive never been punched by me so i cant rate it at all
4022686 i want my legacy to be that rampage was one of the most entertaining fighter there ever was in the sport
4022687 the thing about quinton is when you look across the cage and you see that scowl you know what youre in for you know hes not joking any more
4022688 the fans get mad when i look mean in the pictures with them but i fight for a living im not a barbarian but im still a fighter im not a basketball player they can smile pretty boys football players theyre kind of mean but they still smile
4022689 this is fighting its like the most full contact sport im not only a fighter im a ufc fighter one of the best athletes on the planet youve got to look mean thats how i feel im already ugly why try to look better smiling look mean
4022690 ive got four kids ive got to put through college so ive got to save up for tuition and possibly bail money theyre bad as hell as well
4022691 my left knee has been sore for 10 to 12 years
4022692 it will be nice to finally have a healthy leg the doctors have assured me that my long term health will be a hell of a lot better than its been over the last decade im really looking forward to that
4022693 i dont really listen to doctors all that well anyway
4022694 im playing the u s open and im going to win
4022695 i really didnt practice a whole lot going into the open and i couldnt play more than nine holes in preparation for it
4022696 after dealing with that i decided to make the u s open my last event for the season no matter how it turned out whether i missed the cut or if i ended up winning the tournament it was going to be my last event
4022697 we have to see how this thing heals everyone heals at a different rate some people are back to playing sports in six months some are nine some are 12 so to be honest with you no one really knows until we start the rehab process
4022698 i just had some good feelings going into those two major championships to a venue that i liked
4022699 and not to be able to go it is frustrating
4022700 its about those 12 guys its not about me im not part of that crew
4022701 when i had my cyst removed from my acl there wasnt a whole lot left
4022702 so they said basically you need to train and develop your hamstring and glute and calf as much as you possibly can to hold it everyone was surprised it lasted as long as it did before i ruptured it it was just running on the golf course just happened to take one little step it didnt really take much and it just popped
4022703 the natural rotation of the golf swing without the acl made it a little bit unstable and it caused some cartilage damage because of that
4022704 i had that rectified after the masters when they went in there they discovered some more cartilage damage that theyd have to fix in conjunction with the acl reconstruction and it was going to be kind of a double dip there print
4022705 as his peers have acknowledged by selecting him coach of the year the past two seasons mike has built one of the top mens basketball programs in the big east conference
4022706 his quiet confidence and class are a perfect fit for notre dame and i am sure that well enjoy still more success in coming years
4022707 i love the momentum of our program and the facility improvements that we are making at the joyce center
4022708 the perfect plan for me for curlin and for everybody associated with him is to first establish his level of quality on the turf in the man owar and not get ahead of ourselves
4022709 if he can compete at his level on the turf and we get the race that we expect we will map out how to win the arc with him if we establish that hes as good a horse on the turf as he is on the dirt then we will get him over there get him relaxed comfortable and confident and doing right
4022710 i believe international racing is going to be very strong in the future i want curlin to be in the forefront of that movement what we would like to get done is something that no one has done before
4022711 its my first time to open a round at the top of the leaderboard
4022712 starting this week from the first day ive been playing pretty well
4022713 i came here and did exactly what i wanted to do i felt i pretty much i even lapped the race and in the second half i gained a few placings im hopeful i can go under 30 minutes at the national junior championships
4022714 my original goal was to make the final and i have a new goal now to make the podium
4022715 if i just keep doing what im doing i think it is possible
4022716 if the airlines dont strike chris will be in the arena
4022717 chris is ready to go he definitely wants to play
4022718 he isnt an egoist but a guy that wants to win with the team the chemistry will work fine
4022719 i expect there to be a little sand in the engine at first
4022720 but thats not a big problem i think chris is one of the five best centres in the world
4022721 im sure you guys are going to eat this up a lot more than i am i dont call it a no hitter for me i only went six innings
4022722 but its a 1 0 loss thats the way we look at it
4022723 i believe if he just picked it up with his bare hand and flipped it he gets him by a good step and a half
4022724 so my thinking was it really wasnt a bang bang play i looked at the replay once and it looked like kemp was a good seven steps away so my thinking was weaver had plenty of time to make the out
4022725 i hit it off the end of the bat and it had a little funky english on it
4022726 he could have made the play but he just dropped the ball it was an error i mean if theyd have given me a hit id have been happy but it was an error by far
4022727 to come out of a game like that with no hits it was pretty bizarre
4022728 while this moment is bittersweet were parting on good terms and we know that each of us has benefited greatly from the other
4022729 ive learned so much from them and have a tremendous amount of respect for what theyve built
4022730 ive modeled my usac and world of outlaws teams the same way they built their nascar team and i made it a point to find good people to run those programs
4022731 if ive learned anything from my time at joe gibbs racing its that joe gibbs saying of you win with people is incredibly true they always surrounded me with not just good people but great people and the results speak for themselves
4022732 while our time together is coming to an end we know theres still a lot of racing left this season and we plan to make the most of it
4022733 no matter what tony and i will remain close friends
4022734 i know when it comes to the no 20 team things will obviously be a lot different next year but i remain as committed as ever this year to winning races with tony and securing our spot in the chase to contend for a third championship
4022735 the 20 car has been one of the all time great partnerships in nascar for the last decade with the combination of tony zippy the home depot and joe gibbs racing
4022736 while we are losing one piece of the puzzle we think the no 20 team will remain strong for many years to come
4022737 he was a great competitor he couldnt stand not running well and he made everyone at jgr want to win just as badly as he did
4022738 he was a leader for me from the day i started at jgr and then really helped me out when i made the move up to the cup series he never sought me out to give me advice but all i had to do was ask and he would give me as much time as i needed print
4022739 theres no guarantees that this is going to be successful
4022740 but after sitting down and evaluating what the potential of this team is i wouldnt have made this decision if i didnt think it would be successful and if i didnt think it had the potential to be great
4022741 we could never be mad or hold that against him
4022742 his success our success as a group would not be possible without him
4022743 for myself i think youve got to look at whats best for me where am i most comfortable and where are my obligations
4022744 theyre with joe gibbs racing my guys have supported me and most of them have continued to work with me for 10 years or more thats important to me
4022745 he doesnt just put his name on it he puts his heart into it
4022746 i feel like that we have the variables in place to go out and be competitive right away
4022747 at the same time we know its a rebuilding process and its going to be an adjustment period how long is this adjustment period going to take we dont know
4022748 if anybodys ever seen me pitch im out there laughing and having fun
4022749 thats just me and thats something that i didnt do last year when we get to the playoffs ill definitely be doing that
4022750 the other teams in our division arent going to sit back and look at this and say oh now the brewers have got cc sabathia
4022751 we all headed into this season with what feel are well founded expectations for a championship contending season
4022752 four core players on the dl tough for almost any franchise to overcome as well as disappointing performances from many components of our team most noticeably in the bullpen leave us at the juncture were at there wasnt much doubt or question in our mind that it was nearly impossible for us to become a contending club this year
4022753 matt laporta is going to be a good big league player and i hope he is
4022754 but you can go for it in a stupid fashion and doug and his group have never done that
4022755 its hard to tell people in years past three years from now were going to be good
4022756 cc made it clear that once the season started he did not want to entertain any negotiations
4022757 our exploration of a contract was thorough enough in spring training to understand the combination of our capabilities and ccs expectations didnt align
4022758 its hard enough to play this game as it is let alone with any other distractions such as a contract going on
4022759 ill focus on that when it comes right now im worried about pitching tomorrow
4022760 i just want the fans to be happy with me
4022761 the game plan stayed intact and he fought a great fight
4022762 david diaz hes a tough guy but being a tough guy isnt enough ive never given an a plus before but he fought a great fight theres not a lot he could have done better
4022763 i could deal with the power but not his speed i got tricked by his speed i gave it my all his speed is what it sealed it for me his speed was uncontrollable
4022764 if manny fights marquez like that on his toes and boxes hell demolish him
4022765 we moved into marquezs power shots all night long tonight we moved away from davids power and he couldnt do anything
4022766 that friday i was sitting in the locker room packing up my things to go home
4022767 it was probably one of the hardest rounds that ive had
4022768 you come out and shoot 60 and anything above 60 feels like yourer not playing that great i dont think i hit one solid iron shot out there
4022769 dont tell me that i had a five footer on 17 that i missed gosh if somebody would have told me par was 71 yesterday maybe i could have shot 59 who knows
4022770 for sure we were one of the first if not the first to embrace it but its spreading
4022771 i think its quite sad that taking that stance is such a story
4022772 it was like this deep dark secret that everybody knew about but nobody outside did
4022773 i remember a great champion telling me that you couldnt win races without epo
4022774 in sort of the old days of cycling the message was your job is to win races
4022775 for me its kind of full circle in a way
4022776 its not a position i could have imagined five years ago when all the stuff went down
4022777 its easy to think that were standing on a soapbox
4022778 but at the time our team was being built professional cycling was a mess
4022779 everybody has to go get another job and thats life
4022780 i would not contemplate putting on such scenes which i would find distasteful and i would expect most people to be disgusted at the suggestion of a nazi theme and respond similarly
4022781 like children playing cowboys and indians its adults having fun
4022782 under no circumstances and im very upset and offended because it is an insult and offence if a newspaper equates german with being nazi my grandparents were not members of that party
4022783 he could walk with any crowd and make them feel like they were the most important person in the world
4022784 clem mcspadden was a true oklahoman a dear friend and a deeply committed public servant who loved the state of oklahoma and its people and he spent his life working to make a difference in the lives of those around him
4022785 through his work in the oklahoma legislature and in congress clem helped to build the great state we know today
4022786 clem was not only respected in political circles outside of the state capitol and washington d c he was known and admired as a legendary rodeo announcer who loved the sport and carried on the heritage and tradition of the west
4022787 that was the first thing i thought i defected in canada and now my debut is going to be in canada
4022788 id been working so hard to get here and it was my first time out there im not going to lie i got a little nervous which is normal but from now on ill take it from here and do a better job
4022789 it was in my mind but i wasnt 100 per cent
4022790 i started deciding at the end of the tournament that i was going to defect and then i finally made up my mind 100 per cent that i was going to stay back
4022791 they supported me a lot and i really appreciate what they did for me until i got all the paperwork and everything together so i could go across
4022792 i had trouble crossing into the states but everything worked out for me paperwork customs there were a lot of complications my goal was to get to the united states to play baseball
4022793 i couldnt believe it when norfolk manager gary allanson told me i was going to come up here to toronto and join the team i was very excited print
4022794 but i think ill have to make a trip to a fishing store and maybe buy some stuff first
4022795 you make brief reminders to yourself about where you are on the field
4022796 a lot of times you might look at the hash mark and say in the nfl when i got the hash i knew where the sideline was and that my free safety wasnt too far away
4022797 then i look up and stein argos safety orlondo steinauer is all the way on the other hash so i have to adjust and play a little bit differently its just knowing where your landmarks are
4022798 for a while i was just frustrated with being injured a bunch and kind of thought about not playing football
4022799 but then i really missed it and am excited to be back out here playing again
4022800 i dont think that was the true me because i had never been in trouble before in my life and i grew up in the roughest parts of south florida you learn from it and move on my advice to younger guys is if theres something you dont want to do say no it was a costly costly lesson for me that i learned a lot from
4022801 perfect greens perfect easy to stop between the trees no problem
4022802 you make a mistake and youre dead i lost concentration at no 10 i never lost it after that
4022803 i finally made some putts i basically hit bottom at the senior pga championship in may at oak hill
4022804 i couldnt get a putt in the hole i had five birdies for the week this course has worked for me through the years
4022805 i need two knee replacements im going to play two more tournaments and then im quitting done
4022806 its not any fun at all i wanted to come back and play here one more time before the curtain closes so thats what i did tried to make the best of it i saw some good golf today so that was worth it
4022807 im a 15 handicapper now i cant practice anymore i show up on thursdays and play in the pro am and try and play but i can ride my harley though and thats a good thing at least ive got that to look forward to
4022808 it wasnt as strong a field as the last two world cups but i was still pleased with how i raced and with the time i posted
4022809 the conditions here were difficult with the waves and i felt i managed all that pretty well
4022810 i havent been on the beijing course yet but apparently high winds could be a factor
4022811 you have a little bit of luck go your way
4022812 it just worked out that way man i dont know what it is
4022813 he works hard hes on his game any time he gets in the car he seems to be quick it seems to be working for him
4022814 they came on the radio and said all right follow t k if he stays out stay out if he pits pit and that was just as i was going by the pit entry you know i was too high to try and pull the car down i think i would have spun out it doesnt happen too often
4022815 it worked out fantastic im bloody happy for the championship to be honest
4022816 it was the right call to come in on lap 148 who can predict the rain unfortunately the rain and i dont get along too well
4022817 but that is a gamble that they took and it worked out in their favour
4022818 we did everything we could and third place is not bad
4022819 were still in the championship hunt were going to keep working hard
4022820 looking out at everybody im really humbled at the turnout
4022821 i didnt really expect all of this but i knew there was a reason why i had to bring the stanley cup back to newfoundland
4022822 its the first time since i became premier where i go over and say hi im danny williams and everybody goes danny who
4022823 newfoundlanders and labradorians do not give in we do not give up and ladies and gentlemen i dont think anybody embodies the fighting spirit more than the young man that we are honouring here today
4022824 it was bigger than i thought and so many names so many teams on it scary
4022825 everybody knows the road hasnt been easy but it certainly has come to a great end here as you can see
4022826 to be honest it didnt look great for a long time but going to detroit was certainly something that has worked out for everybody ive won the stanley cup now and no one can ever take it away from us
4022827 right when it was happening it was like a scene out of days of thunder i couldnt see where cars were or nothing
4022828 it was just black a cloud of dirt in front of me i picked the far left and luckily it was open
4022829 immediately i thought this is that point where everything finally pays me back a little bit for all the bad luck pays this team back for all the bad luck its had not only this year but over the past three years
4022830 im an american boy driving for bobby rahal an american legend on a great american race course and this is a real fourth of july weekend celebration
4022831 you have to have the right person in the drivers seat
4022832 every since ryan came on board hes raised the level of this team
4022833 we lost a lot of valuable points today i feel more down for briscoe and the boys
4022834 i can only imagine how scotts feeling right now i just wish he could have messed up and not gotten me involved i think we had a real shot it would have been a real good fight between me and dixie down to the finish line
4022835 we decided to stay out and i had to save fuel we tried to save fuel and stay in front of people
4022836 it really wont sink in until im actually putting on the red white and blue
4022837 i feel like i need to go make a birdie out there to win
4022838 its always nice to have your name associated with the greats of the game
4022839 im the guy thats going to get their clubs out of the trunks of their car
4022840 i didnt hit the ball close enough to the hole the last two holes to counteract my yips
4022841 ive got to figure it out or id better quit
4022842 if someone had told me that on a tight golf course id have a putt for a playoff id have taken the putt and skipped the rest of the week
4022843 i committed to all these tournaments before when i was ranked 100th in the world
4022844 now all of a sudden ive won twice im probably top 20 in the world now
4022845 ive already committed to milwaukee and im not going to back out
4022846 it came off like a dream took two hops and just slam dunked right in the cup
4022847 you never expect to make them but that really energized me for the last few holes
4022848 with tiger out its just a great opportunity for an old guy here to actually steal some money in that fedex cup
4022849 my only goal was to make the ryder cup team and thats really got me focused for whatever reason
4022850 its at home in valhalla in my home state and at a golf course that i lost the 1996 pga championship to mark brooks in a playoff
4022851 i just feel like i needed to go back there
4022852 he wanted to get me to a place where i could contend and do what im capable of doing
4022853 we both agreed that the timing was perfect his focus on getting them the pacers to a level where they can grow and start to be competitive was tremendous
4022854 i knew last year that this time would be coming
4022855 were stuck in our role here the players can say whatever they want we cant say anything
4022856 i think playing alongside chris bosh gives us a different dynamic
4022857 you look at teams in the nba you look at their low post players and they always have one good player and when that good player goes out you can change your defence a little bit and load up on other areas even with us starting out the games together one of us will always be on the floor you wont get a chance to adjust your defence
4022858 youre talking about a team thats extremely athletic extremely big at the wing positions and they play defence
4022859 with my defensive mentality and ability to change the game and chriss ability to block shots and change the game its exciting
4022860 when i sat out all those games last year it was a career move
4022861 i knew what the situation was i knew what the significance of me staying away from the game rehabbing the leg and getting the knee back to its normal usage was
4022862 if i had to place a guess i would say yes
4022863 but if i had to make a decision on that now i would say this will probably be it
4022864 its no secret what scotty has meant to this organization over the past three years
4022865 ive probably been sitting on this decision for a little bit and its been good just to see how i felt after committing to it personally
4022866 i let a little time pass after that and it felt like the right decision
4022867 im excited to get back playing some hockey with the guys we have in our room
4022868 i had a lot of fun in my short year last year
4022869 i guess after a short year and a shorter playoff run i definitely physically and mentally feel ready to go a lot more energized
4022870 thats probably a big difference this year as opposed to last year
4022871 i talked to him a couple of times before i made my final decision
4022872 i think hes back in finland now i just want him to make the right decision for him personally and really not interfere with that
4022873 that hasnt really come into my thought process a whole lot and i now know that its going to a lot more going forward
4022874 yeah its a big thing obviously ive only played in the one olympics 2002 and it was a great experience something i wouldnt trade for anything being part of team canada
4022875 to be able to do something like that in your home province and your home country would be even better it would be a great opportunity but theres a lot of other things to think about before then i really havent evaluated what im going to do beyond this year
4022876 i didnt know anything about golf back then but i was watching her
4022877 it was very impressive for a little girl i just thought that i could do it too
4022878 really i cant believe i just did this especially with all these big names on the trophy that have been very very successful with the golf
4022879 hopefully ill put a couple of my names on there it will be great
4022880 she was very calm never changed anything and really thats very impressive for a 19 year old shes going to win a lot more
4022881 i finished third at the u s open my first pro event
4022882 its probably the most disappointed ive been in a very long time
4022883 maybe not the one i had in mind but ill take it
4022884 i really tried to stay calm but it was so exciting i couldnt do it this is my day
4022885 my dad almost was going to fly to this event yesterday but im like no its ok
4022886 it wasnt a breeze i needed to get lucky a couple of times but overall it went well im still here
4022887 its the worst youre ever going to feel to win half a million bucks
4022888 all these guys who bust out now i actually have kind of an advantage and even more of a win and a title that none of them get to have
4022889 its not this huge disappointment because its like i already won this cool title
4022890 it may not be a world series of poker bracelet but thats really huge and it makes me really happy
4022891 we are aware that some member boards want zimbabwes membership taken away but we are with zimbabwe on this
4022892 however we also understand the positions taken by the england and wales cricket board ecb and cricket south africa csa as they were prompted by the advice of the governments in those countries we do not blame them as they are bound by what their governments decide
4022893 but our position is very clear on the issue of full membership and we would like to totally support zimbabwe on that
4022894 we would love to see zimbabwe chucked out of the council but the chances of that happening are a little bit remote
4022895 new zealand is in a very small minority on the international cricket council which would like to see strong action taken on zimbabwe
4022896 the icc is meeting as we speak and we are just looking at the issues around all of that at the present time but basically we dont want to put our cricketers in a position where they might lose future tours
4022897 a stance that cricket south africa can be proud of
4022898 having played in zimbabwe in 1998 it was almost as though we arrived in a different country in 2004 scenes there reminded me quite strongly of pictures i had seen from eastern europe during the cold war
4022899 we are a full member of fifa and are currently participating in a world cup qualifying campaign we have a swimming program which has produced kirsty coventry a recent winner in the world championships
4022900 so it would be strange that the only sport to take action on so called current worries is cricket when all the other world sporting bodies have not taken that stance
4022901 youd like to play 8 1 2 and shake hands but shaking hands at home plate isnt bad either
4022902 we were hoping to get him into the game theyve got a ton of left handers over there
4022903 i gave up a home run to a hall of famer tonight tonights was probably the easiest one to do hes a pretty good hitter it was down and had some movement on it
4022904 you see signs of it i think hes starting to feel a lot more comfortable that would be a big lift for us if he gets going like hes capable
4022905 dunner said he had a feeling junior was going to do something
4022906 ross got the double and the next thing you know junior is going around the bases
4022907 it kind of worked in our favour a couple of times
4022908 when you get some pitching theres quite a few things that can happen for you
4022909 its not frustrating i had good stuff today and so did their guy
4022910 alex is going to catch a lot of pretty famous people in the coming years
4022911 i am looking into my legal options and deciding on the best way to proceed
4022912 less than ideal laboratory practices but not lies fraud forgery or cover ups
4022913 appelants experts crossed the line acting for the most part as advocates for the appelants cause and not as scientists objectively assisting the panel in the search for truth
4022914 we are pleased that justice was served and that mr landis was not able to escape the consequences of his doping or his effort to attack those who protect the rights of clean athletes
4022915 thats always been part of the system that theyve always had more resources than the athlete this is the first time its even been close
4022916 the landis case will set a precedent not only for the issues related to the application of the standard for laboratories but also for the management of cas procedures
4022917 cas appeals must be conducted promptly efficiently in a fair manner and with reasonable costs involved
4022918 the legal papers are presently with his barrister and we are anticipating serving them next week
4022919 i told michelle not to go too fast he looks like hes good
4022920 i think we can honestly say that but we had a lot of work and a lot of effort put in today and well take it
4022921 ive been on the flipside of it plenty of times
4022922 theres those times when you just grit your teeth and go what could we have done different why did it happen this way so it isnt pretty but well take it
4022923 thats the beauty of sprint cup racing is the competition level is always at its best sometimes the guys that have fast race cars dont win because they got outdueled in the pits with pit strategy you take em when you can get em because you get burned plenty of times the other way
4022924 i felt we had track position and i felt like my fire and desire was going to overcome anything today to get into victory lane
4022925 once i saw that we were leading and we were out in front with 26 laps to go that good old kurt busch jumped up on the wheel and i told myself dont let your team down this is what you live for this is what you race for and that is to get into victory lane
4022926 to be honest we were rooting for it not to rain because we had the fuel milage to make it to the end and the other guys were going to have to pit so we werent really counting on the rain
4022927 it just kind of worked out that they all pitted there and then it rained but it could have worked out the other way too
4022928 the reason why im sitting here is because we got an opportune caution late in the race and took advantage of race position
4022929 its just been the oddest year ive ever seen for this race team
4022930 its just frustrating there isnt anybody thats going to tell you any different than that theres nothing you can do if there was something we could do about it wed change it
4022931 ive got some of the best guys in the garage area and ive had em for 10 years its the worst string of bad luck weve ever seen but theres nothing we can do about it
4022932 he left a legacy which even now we have the duty to try and equalize and why not even to do better
4022933 it feels good especially to get a big win at home against the cream of the crop
4022934 those guys are going to be a tough team throughout the season we know if we want to get to that level were at we have to beat them
4022935 hes an athletic quarterback he can do a lot of things he can do some damage with his arm and also with his legs and he demonstrated both skills this evening
4022936 we didnt even show up tonight we didnt get off the bus
4022937 i did not get them ready to play and we had poor execution on all phases of the game
4022938 we did not have emotion and we were not ready play and that is my fault
4022939 its great how we all came together as one and played this game
4022940 one good thing about being a quarterback is that youve always got that run pass option with the ball in your hand
4022941 i just beat him to the corner of the end zone
4022942 clearly its not something we can make a habit of tearing up that much equipment
4022943 it was a carnagefest out there tonight with all the wrecks and cautions
4022944 we just had the mindset of wanting to make it to the end
4022945 this race was sketchy which is what i expected it was a total dogfight
4022946 were talking about a player in t j thats an asset a starting point guard in the nba
4022947 theres been a lot of interest and teams that have called and inquired have not put deals on the table that have been insulting in any regard in fact its pretty apparent that t j s value is very high
4022948 we are holding our cards close to the vest right now as we need to
4022949 theres a couple of bigs that we feel could step into an nba game and contribute theres also a couple of bigs that have great upside that would be considered longterm projects were intrigued by both those scenarios
4022950 theres also one or two wings that we feel could potentially step into an nba game right now
4022951 we think hes right on path im not going to limit expectations on him i think he can be a heck of a player in this league he wants the puck on the stick when the games on the line
4022952 last year i felt like i got better as the year went on and learned more its important this summer to continue to grow and improve on my skating ability and protecting the puck a lot of that keeps coming from getting stronger strength is the big one for me that will kind of lead into every aspect of the game
4022953 its that simple he plays hard he can still play at a high level skill wise but he plays physically hard too hes accomplished just about everything in this game he wants to win look at how he played in the playoffs when the game is on the line hell do whatever he can to win
4022954 i dont think youll see nabber playing the same number of games as he did last year having two guys like this enables that to take place our goal is to be healthy and rested come playoff time and when you have two guys like this that should be able to happen
4022955 they talk about kelly pavlik a white fighter like hes the second coming or they go crazy over manny pacquiao but im a black fighter
4022956 is it racial absolutely they praise white fighters they praise hispanic fighters whatever but black fighters they never praise
4022957 ive noticed it for a long time but i couldnt say anything because i had to do business with them ill still do business with them but im done holding my tongue
4022958 floyd is a tremendous athlete who gave his all to the sport we have nothing but admiration for what he accomplished in the ring
4022959 his remarks regarding hbo broadcasters and executives are unfortunate and we could not disagree more
4022960 im happy i feel clear i feel free as a bird
4022961 i feel good that i can finally speak out and say the things i want to say
4022962 i feel much much stronger and more powerful at 135
4022963 this is where i plan to stay i did real well i was really surprised it wasnt stopped sooner
4022964 the game plan was not to stand and trade because diaz is too dangerous the plan was to go in and out outbox him do what manny does best he did everything that we asked him to do
4022965 who i fight is the job of my promoter bob arum
4022966 weve been snake bit so much by weather with our small team its just the bad luck of mother nature
4022967 a lot of times you dont put a whole lot of importance on qualifying but what this says here to me today is we have really great engines and kudos to the earnhardt childress for the gains that theyve made since february here
4022968 we didnt have the best car luckily we were leading there when it mattered most
4022969 everybody was laying back and trying to get a run on the last restart
4022970 they got the jump on me i tried to block him maybe i came across edwards nose hard to say its unfortunate we had such a strong run
4022971 i should have stayed on the bottom my car was so good on the bottom
4022972 and in this were trying to save water and do other things that can help the environment it doesnt take much to recycle a can or turn the faucet off
4022973 you never forget things when youre a kid so every time i do something i like to have it involve kids
4022974 i was at my basketball camp earlier and the memories those kids made are going to stay with them the rest of their lives what i do is kid driven i dont do it because i have to i want to
4022975 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
4022976 you want to keep athletics and politics separate i dont want to start getting up on panels or talking about barack or john mccain
4022977 im aware of whats going on not just with the presidential election you want to be aware of gas prices and other things being a father and being responsible for my kids i want to know whats going on in our world
4022978 we found that parents werent sure what they could do
4022979 the marriage of the parties is irretrievably broken because of the husbands extramarital affairs and other marital misconduct
4022980 as you know anyone can pay the filing fee and make allegations
4022981 his priorites are to have a future with his children and be a big part of their lives
4022982 my husband and i are not planning on getting a divorce
4022983 i know alex rodriguez through guy oseary who manages both of us i brought my kids to a yankee game i am not romantically involved in any way with alex rodriguez
4022984 nothing to do with the state of his marriage or what spiritual path he may choose to study
4022985 cynthia has made it very clear to me that she wants to take the high road and protect her children and herself theres no vindictiveness here
4022986 she wants to resolve the issues between alex and herself in an amicable fashion
4022987 i think for alex hes been through this before he knows how to handle it
4022988 im sure there are times he wishes he could just fit in thats the price you pay
4022989 obviously everyone likes to keep their life private unfortunately in this world that doesnt happen
4022990 whether it is to alex i dont know but from what im hearing no its not
4022991 the first round i was scared i almost started crying i didnt know if i made it
4022992 for me the ball was clearly out and the opinion of the umpire as well
4022993 after the breaker i said you have to be ready to take the opportunity if you get it
4022994 i didnt lose serve broke three times thats the kind of match every tennis player wants when you go out there on any surface
4022995 i know hes very against steroids and he wants us to be a leader as far as the treatment of horses
4022996 this is our no 1 industry in the state we want to make the right decisions and not next year this thing has been studied to death
4022997 i think were going to be able to streamline some of the processes and get some things done quicker than maybe we were before the reorganization
4022998 no doubt about it its extra special beating the u s
4022999 the u s have set the bar for the game around the world to beat them now is really special
4023000 we felt kind of secure we were confident that we could keep going with them and we did
4023001 it was a really gutsy performance from our group and particularly the back four
4023002 i really have to say that erin mcnulty was spectacular
4023003 im sorry that a penalty kick has decided this situation
4023004 over these last two years my italy also did something positive and one last game cant erase that
4023005 i think everyone gave their maximum and thats a reason to really be satisfied
4023006 weve performed better but coaching these guys was an honour
4023007 i dont have the foggiest idea of what i will do in the future
4023008 the population and the communities can really see what disabled athletes can do weve got it a little better here in north america because we are advanced in technology we can go there and show them a lot of things
4023009 with them getting the paralympic games that brought knowledge that they can start a lot more sport programs for all their athletes
4023010 they have a huge population and a they have a lot of disabled that opened a lot of doors for their disabled to get out and start a lot of basketball rugby a lot of different programs
4023011 the competition is getting deeper and fiercer as many countries have started investing more in their athletes and paralympic sports
4023012 it is also about inspiring other people excellence isnt just about the podium its about our everydayness
4023013 the more people with a disability are getting out in the world and travelling its opening the eyes of other people that we do have to design things that are more wheelchair accessible or more accessible to people with visibility impairments its all about making the world a better place
4023014 with them getting the paralympic games that brought knowledge that they can start a lot more sport programs for all their athletes
4023015 they have a huge population and a they have a lot of disabled that opened a lot of doors for their disabled to get out and start a lot of basketball rugby a lot of different programs its great for a lot of their athletes
4023016 for us to put out there a top five finish sounds like we are selling ourselves short or we are expecting less out of our athletes
4023017 there are more countries more governments investing in paralympic sports in a way they never used to we know the world is catching up
4023018 a few guys were affected a little bit by the air quality but as a team we did all right
4023019 we came home and said we have to train that much harder so it doesnt affect us through the tournament
4023020 certainly by the time the paralympics happen the factories will have been shut down longer
4023021 were pretty confident beijing will do everything they can to ensure that everything is in place
4023022 accessibility will be an issue in the older venues and on the streets
4023023 anywhere that bogoc has made its mark things will be completely accessible
4023024 they have set the bar as far as im concerned for the way olympic and paralympic games should be treating accessibility
4023025 its important for us to have 10 canadians of influence
4023026 the money doesnt mean much to the top pros making the money thats when we try to raise every pot
4023027 there will be a lot of people who really care about making the money and then there will be a lot of pros who just dont care
4023028 thats when they start popping like chewing gum youre losing two players a minute
4023029 its another experience ill go back to the gym and work harder he just surprised me with a good punch a really solid left
4023030 you never know when a knockout will come i feel good its been two years since i was a champion and thats too much time
4023031 if hes determined enough he should be able to come back after a good rest
4023032 itll be longer and harder and hell have to go through steps hes already been through but fighters who have been knocked out have come back and been champions again
4023033 its funny we were looking to catch hi m coming in with a right and then he caught us coming forward with a left
4023034 we cant sit up here and throw the weight of the world on him
4023035 we think derricks got tremendous qualities that will serve him well for the next 10 or 15 years
4023036 a lot of distractions kids wanting to go out a lot
4023037 i remember when they were playing utah when i was a little kid every time jordan got the ball in his hands my older brother dwayne used to turn off the tv and everybody used to get mad at him
4023038 id like to think itll happen fast but it probably wont
4023039 were going to have dialogue this week with them and their agents and its important that we get this process started
4023040 theyll know where we stand well know where they stand
4023041 its a privilege to get invited to a camp like this
4023042 you just try and be the player that you are on the ice and the person you are off of it
4023043 you know when you coach this team that expectations are high
4023044 its my goal to put the best team on the ice and be as successful as weve been in the past
4023045 the difference between winning and losing is very small most of the time weve been able to win because of the attention to details
4023046 it would be exciting to play a world junior championship in ottawa in the city i play in but im sure the coaches have their ideas of what theyre looking for
4023047 the guys that are coming i dont think theres any guarantees
4023048 if you were on this team last year theres 10 guys that have a chance to come back id say they have a foot up
4023049 i couldnt be more excited im going to a stanley cup contender with an abundance of talent
4023050 we are trying to get younger we are trying to get more talented and were trying to get faster if you look around the league today thats the way the league is going
4023051 zherdev is a player that weve had targeted for a couple of years
4023052 the blue jackets thought the team was a little weak on defence
4023053 with the addition of commodore and these two guys they feel solid on the blue line with a lot of veteran leadership on the back end
4023054 what can i say im happy to be coming to columbus
4023055 i love to play the game when i get there i will try to play my best and work hard and improve myself and hope we can make it to the playoffs
4023056 the addition of fedor and christian to our lineup has really improved our puck moving ability from the blue line
4023057 all strong teams are built from the back end out and we feel like we made significant strides in that area
4023058 in a perfect world i would have liked to see clay bennett leave without the team at all
4023059 it was a tough experience for all of us that were involved in it there was just so much that happened on both sides so much misinterpreted miscommunicated and misunderstood that it was difficult
4023060 we understand that city county and state officials are currently discussing a plan to substantially rebuild keyarena for the sum of 300 million
4023061 if this funding were authorized we believe keyarena could properly be renovated into a facility that meets nba standards relating to revenue generation fan amenities team facilities and the like
4023062 given the lead times associated with any franchise acquisition or relocation and with a construction project as complex as a keyarena renovation authorization of the public funding needs to occur by the end of 2009 in order for there to be any chance for the nba to return to seattle within the next five years
4023063 we have 30 million reasons why we have support for a future nba team
4023064 a really exciting day we had been gearing up for the 2010 season and to find out the teams coming two years early is a bonus
4023065 we believe its baseless has no merit we will fight it vigorously
4023066 were not a party to this settlement and in fact we chose not to participate in it
4023067 hes one of the worlds greatest guys we just didnt have him in the right situation and i take a lot of responsibility for that
4023068 i am a big casey mears fan and i always will be but this is the part of this business that i hate
4023069 in almost everything i do i preach and practice loyalty and friendship but this business is about performance
4023070 there has never been anyone who has driven a car for me that represented our company any better
4023071 he goes above and beyond whatever you need him to do you know you could count on him hes just a model person for the company
4023072 we made a lot of changes he had a lot of crew chiefs we put him in a lot of different situations and i take as much responsibility as anybody as to why he didnt click
4023073 but we got to a point where we couldnt move forward without tearing the whole thing down and starting from scratch
4023074 its been an enormously difficult and long process to get here
4023075 there is certainly clarity and purity to getting back on the track compared to the chaos i have been living the last couple of years
4023076 being able to do two times in one night im shocked and happy and surprised and every other adjective i can think of
4023077 to get the right track and the right guys and the right weather is really difficult so we really had to make the most of it while we had all those elements
4023078 we definitely went through all the proper sanctioning procedures we had all the technical delegates and all the officials we needed
4023079 there is no way to block the times they were legitimate times on the former olympic track in atlanta everything was done by the book
4023080 if they dont thats why god made the court of arbitration for sport
4023081 i think im going to start getting a volume discount from them
4023082 to do something like this only adds to my personal wealth
4023083 i did it more for myself than anything i finish what i start
4023084 i started this thing a couple of years ago and i needed to follow through on it
4023085 for somebody to be found completely innocent and be saddled with a 750 000 debt to prove their innocence when the prosecution was entirely funded by public money thats just not how we do things as canadians
4023086 thats one of things we are going to try and change in the system
4023087 it just seemed like my whole state of mind changed my feelings changed
4023088 it was kind of disappointing when i showed up this morning
4023089 i got on the first tee and im seven behind i knew i had a lot of work to do
4023090 ive just got to get committed to the process of hitting shots and not worrying about it putting the past in the past thats what im trying to do put the past in the past and believe in my own ability
4023091 ive been playing since 2000 and ive been grinding and trying to get to where i am
4023092 its getting close its not where i want it to be but i know what to do and i know how to go about doing it
4023093 im really happy with my situation and im really happy with this jersey im going to wear it through to paris
4023094 for sure this was the hardest day of my life
4023095 im staying with my feet on the ground everyone expects a lot and they can talk all they want but im the one that has to do the work and i know i still have some work to do
4023096 i will come back one day and try to finish on the podium
4023097 i havent been down like that too many times in my career but what are you going to do im not going to throw it all away i spent half my year in training camp and im not going to throw it all away now
4023098 it was uncharacteristic of carlos to attack first hes usually the one off the back and crawling his way back to the front
4023099 that was awesome of carlos im proud of him he deserves it
4023100 im just so happy to be done with these days in the mountains
4023101 a minute 34 seconds is still a long time and carlos isnt a horrible time trialist by any means
4023102 hes a very good time trialist its just everyone has the perception that if youre not top three youre a bad time trialist hes quite good but i dont know its going to be close
4023103 china has quite a lot of sports in which it is a world leader
4023104 with more and more people doing better in tennis i believe more people will love this sport in the future
4023105 i think many people will watch this match in china
4023106 so far i havent found any weak link about her
4023107 but as a first time semifinalist i would rather now enjoy the game more than anything else
4023108 i think shes doing a fabulous job and i dont think its luck
4023109 i was just trying to hang in there and try to turn it around in the second set it worked a little bit
4023110 actually i have to give her credit she played great
4023111 it was the same time as the world cup therefore it was not received as sensational
4023112 its just a mistake that happened but its not as big a deal as everyone is trying to make it out to be
4023113 im just getting flooded with everybody calling me all the time with negative stuff i wish it would all stop
4023114 since everyone is giving me the opportunity to appeal it and postpone it thats what im going to be doing until i cant postpone it any more
4023115 rick dutrow is all about his horses he cares for his horses immensely
4023116 apparently what happened with salute the count is that he was administered a legal and i reiterate legal amount of medication too close to race day it was during big brown mania rick is a phenomenal trainer but a poor administrator
4023117 if every state would have the same rules i would love it if everything is the same playing field were going to do as good if not better than everybody
4023118 i know they wanted me to go down to washington to ask me a bunch of questions i wasnt feeling on top of my game if i had a gun to my head i would have went but no one put a gun to my head
4023119 now everyone looks at me as im a drug kind of guy if youre a drug kind of guy youre going to go out there and watch your horses break down i want anybody here to tell the last time theyve seen one of my horses break down in the afternoon
4023120 youre not going to be able to find it because im safe im sound i protect my horses i remember lake pontchartrain broke down in boston eight or nine years ago and i cant remember another time one of my horses broke down in the afternoon and that has to count for something
4023121 he got his little break hes jogging every day so hes ready to roll
4023122 when you pull a horse up in a race something is supposed to be wrong
4023123 so im still looking for that once we gallop him if michelle nevin tells me hes great ill be feeling good once we breeze him and she says hes the same horse ill be feeling very good he still has these tests to pass
4023124 i think the first half mile of the race the trip that he got was just one of the worst trips you would ever want to see in a horse
4023125 for it to be an issue the jock has to feel it and i have to see it
4023126 the jock didnt feel it and i didnt see it i know there other people believe thats what happened and man i hope theyre right
4023127 im not a 100 per cent satisfied with my race
4023128 it was a very strategical race and it got off to a slow start i was pretty hesitant i pushed the pace early on but with three laps to go the ethiopians just went so fast
4023129 there are entire centuries when a country accomplishes nothing at all and then there are weeks like this past one in which it shatters its most deep rooted inferiority complexes
4023130 before the death of franco we were a poor country a poorly run country
4023131 now there is no country that matches spain for champions
4023132 i thought this fight was more a draw than the other one
4023133 i would love to be one of the operator engineers on this job to tear it down
4023134 friday was kind of an embarrassment i think its an anomaly for our team thats not our team we have to clean a lot of things up but i havent changed my mind about this team everything i felt coming in i still feel i think this team if they stay focused stay committed and realize we have no room to monkey around we can accomplish this thing
4023135 youre always going to feel like an underdog if youre coming from canada playing basketball its not the sport here
4023136 you ask croatians or yugoslavian guys theyre celebrated in their country theyre an institution they never feel like an underdog here basketball is growing and were trying to do our part to help it grow there might be some underdog status there but there is a lot of heart within this team that canadian grit has been here guys were out playing hockey guys were taking guys into the boards thats still in us
4023137 this team is deeper and more talented than our group from 2000
4023138 our starting five i would put up against anybody at any time
4023139 its more size more finding out who we are were still looking at what combinations to use were still waiting to get guys healthy and in a rhythm
4023140 nach dem erfolgreichen jahresabschluss haben wir nun einen guten start ins neue gesch ftsjahr vollzogen und durch unsere neue strategische ausrichtung ein herausragendes ergebnis erzielt
4023141 nun gilt es die f r die zukunft des unternehmens notwendigen investitionen zu t tigen und die strategische ausrichtung auf die steigerung des lizenzanteils am umsatz und damit die steigerung der profitabilit t langfristig konsequent voranzutreiben wir sind zuversichtlich unsere ziele auch zuk nftig weiterhin zu erreichen
4023142 the new england patriots take the conduct of our players very seriously
4023143 we are aware of the very disturbing and alarming reports regarding willie andrews we will not offer any additional comment as is our policy regarding pending legal matters
4023144 we played an organized game and the success of our systems proved to be the key factor
4023145 however we will still need to improve the other aspects of our game as this competition continues i am very happy with the effort of our athletes
4023146 evidence was that mike tyson put up us 50 000 to kill
4023147 hes sort of the spiritual adviser to perhaps the most dangerous group of gangsters in the city
4023148 he went up it wasnt there he went up a little higher
4023149 we made mistakes but first game youre going to make mistakes i thought there too many fouls at the defensive end but everybody was trying to make the extra pass trying to move the ball i thought we had spurts where we were trying to get after people
4023150 youre not going to be perfect right now but i was happy with the effort the first game
4023151 if you look at his body hes an athletic freak i even told him when i was talking to him yesterday i cant believe how amazed i am about his improvement in his game offensively he has put in a ton of work on his offensive game
4023152 joel is just a pleasure to be around hell run through a wall and if doesnt get the ball 10 times he wont change his work ethic hes a lot of fun to have on this team
4023153 its fun it was a great feeling the national anthem all those eerie feelings keep coming back
4023154 this is a team on a mission were focused on beijing
4023155 we have a lot of things to clean up and as the level of competition rises our margin for error is going to be less and less so these games are the ones we can take to clean stuff up
4023156 looks like this ultralight builder finished the wings and ran out of money
4023157 this is probably going to be a watershed moment for poker
4023158 change doesnt happen overnight but a change in intention can happen overnight and our intention here is to help more people experience our thrills and excitement
4023159 its a media thing and its great for media as far as the game goes not so great as far as the actual play
4023160 many of the potential problems are pretty unlikely but they exist and they could all be avoided by doing the final table right away
4023161 from a competitive standpoint theres no question amateurs have a huge advantage huge based on the delay
4023162 if i make the final table they have a library of hands that they can look up on me on youtube just tons of footage that they can study
4023163 the law is so poorly written and so ill defined and so hard to implement that millions of americans every day are still playing poker online
4023164 tim is optimistic and he wants to proceed with life and get back on track
4023165 the videos that were distributed by the government were very clear in what his role and his actions were
4023166 its not true that you could take epo and not be detected
4023167 after the 2006 games in turin i decided to go on
4023168 i thought id be able to make it to 2010 but this year i realized its time to stop
4023169 i now wish to focus on my speedskating boot company which allows me to stay involved in this sport i am so passionate about
4023170 powell always liked competing in stockholm and bolt ran in a relay here two years ago
4023171 i really have to pull up my socks if i am going to go to the olympics
4023172 it is the last chance for me to qualify and if i dont it will be my last able bodied meet of the year
4023173 the field we have given oscar should bring him close
4023174 you need a group of athletes whove got personal bests of 45 10 to 45 60 ive put the core of the race in that range and put him in the middle of it
4023175 we had only a month and a half to prepare after the court case so realistically it wasnt going to be the best race
4023176 it was a combination of a lot of little things that added up to a terrible time and a terrible performance but ive got no one to blame but myself
4023177 they all feel really good to have won they are fun and i love derbys
4023178 paradigm just didnt focus really well and was off from the first fence
4023179 i try not to think that i am riding against ian millar lauren hough and eric lamaze
4023180 the ultimate fighter won a five round upset decision over light heavyweight title holder jackson on saturday night in a raucous ufc 86 mixed martial arts main event before a sellout crowd of 11 172 good for a gate of us 3 3 million at the mandalay bay events center
4023181 im not a feared guy but im going to fight you for 25 minutes
4023182 whoever you are anybody at 205 im not going to break im not going to quit
4023183 you know what i didnt think forrest could hang with me
4023184 i said if forrest gets past the third round hell gain my respect and i respect him and if i ever fight him again im going to respect the hell out of him with my right hand
4023185 i feel like if youre the champ somebody got to beat the champ but it was unanimous im not a judge
4023186 i thought it was an amazing display of heart and balls
4023187 he had no leg in that second round and he kept on coming kept fighting
4023188 i think were going to have to do that again and that sucks for me
4023189 he really hurt my leg he just whupped my ass
4023190 im a swimming fan as much as i am a swimmer im happy for those guys it was a fun thing to be a part of
4023191 it was our league that virtually adopted him when he was just a boy and its our league that has looked to him as a man for counsel inspiration and leadership by example
4023192 as much as the cfl has meant to bob he has meant so much more to us
4023193 like bob used to tell me wally sleep on the losses
4023194 the one thing that bob brought every day was a tremendous amount of passion
4023195 he cared about this franchise it was a part of him it was a big part of his life
4023196 he asked a lot from his staff he got a lot from his staff but he gave a lot
4023197 he was someone you could look up to not only as a football person but as a real winner in life
4023198 it didnt matter your position in the organization everyone was dealt with the same way and treated with the same respect
4023199 built a team and as he did he strengthened our province and our country
4023200 bobs determination dedication and commitment to the b c lions the fans and his community serve as an example of exemplary citizenship that all british columbians can be proud of
4023201 some people couldnt accept that id risen through the ranks to become a successful sports franchise executive
4023202 call it envy call it what ever but the name sounded disparaging and it ticked kay off to hear it
4023203 i thought it would be great to be the water boy if vancouver got a team
4023204 the next morning i skipped school and headed down to the office
4023205 his contribution was so tremendous and our gratitude is so profound they exceed even the deep sense of loss we feel today
4023206 we went 5 1 on the trip and i felt we let one slip away
4023207 you get to that point youve got a team thats doing something special
4023208 nobody remembers the first half everybody remembers the second half and the last day of the season weve got a lot of work ahead of us interleague play is done now
4023209 im not going to sit here and say i expected us to be at this particular place in the standings
4023210 its been an anonymous first half theres no one guy having a killer season which makes it more appealing to me that were at this juncture knowing somebodys going to turn into a beast in the second half
4023211 we talk about it all the time going from first to third but i tell you not everybody on this team would have tried that

4023214 that was probably one of the most painful races of my life
4023215 everything was left in the pool i definitely would not have been able to do it without lochte beside me hes a great friend and a great competitor i love racing him
4023216 stephanie really raised the bar when she broke my old record
4023217 im just excited for beijing and i think its going to be a really tough challenging race with her
4023218 at the end when i was getting a little tired the suit gave me a little extra edge
4023219 my main focus was the time trial but im very pleased to win the road race
4023220 i wanted to be well positioned for the sprint and i gave everything i had
4023221 that wasnt a sure thing because the competition was very strong i gave everything i had in the latter part of the race after breaking away from the pack
4023222 i came here to win and i did it twice
4023223 ive been training for four years for these games im in great shape and the times ive posted show that i can get on the podium at the games
4023224 this is a super win for me coming when it does i feel great and so do my horses heading into next week and the spruce meadows north american championship
4023225 my morale went from sky high to below my feet
4023226 its not easy a day in prison sleeping there its not ideal these are situations i wouldnt even wish upon a dog
4023227 a ban lets see over the next few days how the situation evolves because in the end the method they adopted doesnt seem 100 per cent certain to me
4023228 it was a kind of reward for making it through the tour
4023229 i am not talking about that with him that is his decision and his visions
4023230 he is clearly very tired i think we have to seriously consider him stepping out
4023231 thats something we need to give full consideration to its important for us that he is part of that decision so well talk with him when he feels better
4023232 it is not really the type of course for me
4023233 its really for a rider like alejandro valverde anyway i hope to do better than athens at the 2004 games when i fell after the start
4023234 that was one of the best shots ive ever hit
4023235 to win in front of the home crowd really feels special i dont know maybe the golf gods were with me this week
4023236 i made bogeys at 14 and 15 and lost the lead for a while and when that happened i figured i had lost the tournament
4023237 i told my caddy that and she said that well just have to win the hard way today
4023238 ill be 100 per cent for the 100 and 400 relay
4023239 i thought it would go away once i warmed up
4023240 by the time i came off the blocks 20 25 metres into the race my hamstring pulled up
4023241 expected to engage in active rest for up to 12 14 days with light physical activity increasing through that period then resume training
4023242 but then again i was still thankful it didnt happen in the 100 and i still have the chance to go to the olympics
4023243 he has an injury and im very confident that hes going to be in place when they say on your mark in beijing
4023244 i understand its been like this for years thats the way it goes
4023245 but considering that my preparation was disrupted due to the back injury in april ill accept it
4023246 my start right now really needs improvement and thats probably because i didnt do any leg work during the back issue but for the back itself its not an concern i dont feel any pain anymore
4023247 hes now well enough to dive and get off the blocks so were going to be able to do the work we need to do to sharpen those up
4023248 we are good friends and thats why i have been telling everyone that it wont be a clash here
4023249 we just came to qualify for the olympics but in the end i guess the crowd was a little disappointed with this
4023250 i just went out there to execute the first 50 and in the end i am very pleased with my performance
4023251 the aim was to make the team and i did that so i am ok im just coming off an injury so i did what i had to do
4023252 my aim first was to make the team it wasnt about the time but i am very pleased with 10 80 seconds
4023253 they all looked amazing were all very excited about this team
4023254 after losing by so little at calabogie its nice to win by a little
4023255 this is the most amazing feeling ive had in my career
4023256 its beautiful i have to thank my symmetrics cycling teammates so much because anybody could have won out there today and it just happened to be me jacob rode his heart out for me in the break
4023257 some of us knew it from the tour just a couple of weeks ago so we may have had an advantage that way its a hard course to chase and sometimes its actually easier to be in a breakaway and ride in a controlled tempo im not a sprinter type of guy so i try to roll a breakaway
4023258 with 500 metres to go i kind of jumped and got a gap on bruno
4023259 he came up again a bit but i was pretty confident i was going to get it i really started to believe with two three laps to go i would have an opportunity to challenge for the gold
4023260 the heat and the length of the race made it a very challenging day that last climb at the end of the loop used up a lot energy and on such a short lap it kept coming back fast
4023261 its inevitable when you play on the global stage that were on that youre going to be subject to different fluctuations at different times
4023262 the fact that we broke all of the records we set last year is terrific but there may be years where were up years where were down bottom line is that were here for the long term and were not going anywhere and i dont know many poker properties that can say that
4023263 i just had to collect a loan from a friend
4023264 i kept drinking all night and then they wouldnt let me on the plane
4023265 i showed them my ticket its like come on i gotta play in the world series of poker
4023266 im really glad im here i thought i could end up anywhere i dont know
4023267 if they see somethings funny they dont know its me so its huge

4023269 today is a great day for hockey in canada and especially in saskatchewan
4023270 the saskatchewan bid team did a great job in bringing a province wide bid and solid business plan for us to consider
4023271 we had three outstanding bids to choose from and all three candidates would have been great hosts of the 2010 iihf world junior championship but at the end of the process we are very confident that saskatchewan will deliver an outstanding event
4023272 the canadian hockey league is proud to be part of bringing the world juniors back to saskatchewan
4023273 this will be a great experience for all of the players and fans that will be part of this championship
4023274 the world juniors is a unique event when it is held in canada and the chl and our member clubs in saskatchewan will again help to run a first class event in the heartland of major junior hockey
4023275 we knew we had a strong bid with outstanding support from the saskatchewan hockey community and our partners in saskatoon regina and the province of saskatchewan
4023276 we will now start the process of building a strong host organizing committee to plan what we know will be a great 2010 world junior championship
4023277 this was a great team effort and it feels great to win the 2010 world junior championship for saskatchewan

4023314 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
4023315 i wanted to show that the olympics are above politics and i wanted to show a sign of peace
4023316 we are not playing the georgian team we are playing against our brazilian friends
4023317 if we go back we will be disqualified from the olympics
4023318 we wont be able to compete in the summer games or the winter games
4023319 normally in the games there is peace but russia turned it around
4023320 it is a difficult time but the government has a lot of hope for these athletes
4023321 it means very much for our country because of the conflict now
4023322 thank you to my country thank you to my people
4023323 the engineers have completed their preliminary studies and will give recommendations
4023324 depending on what the engineer studies show we may have to look for alternative sites
4023325 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4023326 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
4023327 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well
4023328 are getting better each game and what you can expect from spain is they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it
4023329 weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
4023330 i said to my assistant coach maybe the lights will go out now and it could be over
4023331 i think i already have got off to a good start
4023332 im feeling positive vibes out here my routes are good im consistently catching the ball and im feeling confident about my game
4023333 just give me more opportunities to go out there and catch balls and make plays and everything will be great
4023334 i know its just preseason but its always good to get back into the season mode especially for a receiver you have to get the speed of the game down and get a little contact in
4023335 the last two seasons from midseason on reggie has played very well
4023336 reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4023337 im going to go out and make plays and do my job
4023338 it would be great if hes going to contribute if we have more receivers to go out and help the team thats awesome you want a deep squad the more the merrier
4023339 i had a tendency to work on my strengths instead of my weaknesses and i tried to reverse that this year
4023340 thats something i wanted to work on i went out and bought a couple of ball machines i put one in georgia and had one in jersey wherever i went i wanted to get catches and keep my eyes focused that helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4023341 the thing about me is i always get ahead of myself
4023342 i look back and think about the mistakes i made and then i think about the ones i might make as long as i stay right here right now that will help me as a receiver
4023343 were just not getting it done can we get it done i dont know because were not getting it done your performance speaks for itself its not like theyre not trying weve got some weak spots can we get it done so far weve had a hard time proving it
4023344 thats with pitching thats with hitting thats with everything youre going to go into those periods when youre not going to pitch well or youre not going to hit well those shouldnt be very long if you plan on winning
4023345 the desire is there obviously sometimes you have to tip your cap to the other team for pitching well
4023346 sooner or later youve got to come to the conclusion that it is what it is
4023347 you say we can do better well yeah guys have better years at times therefore we can do better
4023348 i shouldnt have gone out there it was stupid im wasting the teams time by trying to go out there and be a hero
4023349 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4023350 i think that was probably about three weeks ago i think ive learned to overcome i cant affect that sort of outcome all i know is that i can go out there and throw one pitch at a time wherever they hit it so be it just try to limit the runs i felt i definitely did a good job of it
4023351 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4023352 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4023353 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
4023354 he is not from another planet he is from the future
4023355 continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
4023356 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4023357 i just saw china come with a very big push
4023358 i tried to go up a little but it wasnt a very organized effort
4023359 when we started hitting the stands the noise picked up and we started saying hey lets give it a little bit more
4023360 before we knew it with 250 meters left we went for it because we could smell the finish line and it was good enough to get us qualified
4023361 these nonmedical anabolic steroids are easy to get often on the internet and they are dangerous drugs with serious psychological and medical side effects

4023374 its hard knowing well its hard being the one who makes the mistakes
4023375 alicia kept telling us she was sorry she didnt make the mistakes on purpose shes human shes not a robot
4023376 i dont think the weight was so much of a goal as much as the hard work and effort was
4023377 everybody came in here this summer ready to work use last year as motivation everybody worked really hard and the weight gain was just a result of that
4023378 i think this summer strength and conditioning coach rob phillips hard work and the new weight room made a difference the new equipment we got in the weight room was a big plus we worked out a lot in the indoor facility and its hot in there so it was a lot of weight lifting conditioning going on at the same time
4023379 basically the only thing i told them was the bigger you are the stronger you are as long as you can maintain your speed and endurance level then that big man is what we want
4023380 im not a numbers guy i dont care what they weigh i just want them to be able to run and make plays
4023381 we got together as a group after spring and we talked about getting into the same summer session group to work out together it helped build team chemistry among our unit
4023382 its nothing more than getting them to understand do your job and count on your brother to do his job and if we all do our job we can stop the run
4023383 hell never tell you that he cant play but by saying that its kind of sore and its throbbing all night you kind of get the feeling that its pretty rough
4023384 its just been a struggle as of late for him to get back to 260 or 270 get his head above water
4023385 we are all very relieved that its just a bone bruise
4023386 i told him that there were a lot of worse places he could have gotten hit pitching hand pitching elbow shoulder face you name it
4023387 it just means that youre old and doing this and somebody keeps being silly enough to give you a job
4023388 we took it out of the locker and wore it had some fun with it up there a little bit
4023389 did some headfirst slides you slide a lot farther than he can down here
4023390 buses are arriving late in the morning and the afternoon
4023391 i wasnt going to let him walk home by himself and he said he lived right behind the school
4023392 im a student and i work a part time job
4023393 people dont understand one thing official russian authorities hardly have anything to do with
4023394 were looking at how we can expand here at our main campus modernize the look and feel of our building and give us the needed capacity that were seeing every day
4023395 every day were feeling pressure in our emergency room our intensive care unit and our operating room suites and we have got to meet that demand thats out there
4023396 i think everyone in acadiana will be very excited about our expansion and renovation project here at the main campus
4023397 one of the many reasons that i had for wanting to come here was the ability to run a system with multiple hospitals and lafayette general i believe is in position to grow those exponentially
4023398 im a firm believer in joint ventures and partnerships and well embrace them as we see them
4023399 lafayette general has always performed incredibly well in patient satisfaction
4023400 but my goal would be for us to consistently be in the 95th percentile in patient care and patient satisfaction
4023401 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4023402 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
4023403 right now were just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4023404 he had told me he had been working out and we put him through some things the last couple days
4023405 i think he has handled the last few days well
4023406 but im not naive to the problem either i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4023407 it shook him up a little bit obviously but hes doing ok
4023408 the point is that animal control has never expanded to keep up with the growing population and the growing number of animals
4023409 the things that weve asked for are just a band aid
4023410 we have to think of the animals but we also have to think of our employees weve asked for improvements but weve asked for a band aid we need to make it better
4023411 id also like to request that a representative from the correctional facility be here at that time
4023412 i need some clarification on how much the parish is paying for outside municipalities

4023418 estoy totalmente de acuerdo en que se haga una cumbre donde estemos todos los gobernantes
4023419 yo pienso que debe haber una cumbre de este tama o para tratar estos y otros temas y que definamos la agenda de lo que ah vamos a tratar
4023420 en esta ocasi n les vamos a contar que en un m ximo de 30 d as queremos ver a todos reunidos y que realmente se tome una decisi n de estado para bajar dr sticamente la impunidad en el tema del secuestro no estamos pidiendo nada extraordinario
4023421 veamos todo el mapa completo qu est pasando con el ministerio p blico cuando detienen a un secuestrador har n auto de formal prisi n el juez cambia los delitos y los reclasifica tal vez nos podamos llevar la sorpresa de que siempre sean los mismos ministerios p blicos los que act an mal o que sean los mismos jueces que reclasifican el delito de secuestro
4023422 porque hay un reconocimiento claro del descr dito y la desconfianza que tiene la sociedad respecto de las polic as los jueces los ministerios p blicos y el congreso hay que decirlo con toda claridad
4023423 porque hay un reconocimiento claro del descr dito y la desconfianza que tiene la sociedad respecto de las polic as los jueces los ministerios p blicos y el congreso
4023424 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4023425 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
4023426 ha ha dont have to work on that nap boy am i smart
4023427 when you look at the calorie use of many different gardening activities you will be surprised at just how high they are
4023428 if you spend about three hours doing some weeding lawn mowing raking etc you will probably use the same amount of calories as in an hours strenuous gym session
4023429 i personally dont say you have to stretch before you work out
4023430 but maybe walk around your yard for a few minutes and look at what youre going to do
4023431 there are many other things you can do this is a quick start
4023432 hey it worked well for phil itll also work fine and dandy for me
4023433 we are going to take over georgias military command and run the shit from the pentagon
4023434 the us ministry of defense is going to take over georgias airports and sea ports
4023435 pointedly using military planes and ships and warning russia not to block sea air or land transport routes while insisting it had no plans to intervene militarily
4023436 this is not an attempt to put military assets in closer proximity to inject u s forces into this conflict
4023437 the key thing about this is that the process will be fully automated so there is no requirement for a skilled person to use the technology
4023438 theres nothing to say that a veterinary lab assistant couldnt go out and swab birds and run the test at present tests have to be sent to a lab where you need fully trained personnel and thats where the hold up occurs
4023439 stumbleupon for the past two weeks democrats have been losing the energy debate badly poll after poll showed democrats losing major ground in the fight over new oil drilling and some declared that energy could be a turning point in the run up to november new energy reform act
4023440 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise
4023441 upon review of the specific purpose of the monsignor john r portman chair in roman catholic theology the university of san diego is no longer considering the appointment of dr rosemary radford ruether as the 2009 2010 chair holder
4023442 a national organization that works for catholic women to be priests and for a more inclusive roman catholic church
4023443 i am a member of the department in question the administration made an end run around the faculty half of whom are out of the city and simply made a decision without consultation with the department of theology and religious studies it is a first in the long history of administrators working with our department
4023444 es m s incierto que el de los ltimos trimestres

4023448 cuando me dijeron que la cartera que devolv ten a 2 700 euros pens que era much simo dinero pero el dinero no toca mi cabeza ni mi coraz n y gastar ese dinero me habr a hecho feliz un momento pero me habr a hecho sufrir toda mi vida
4023449 porque hay muchas personas que piensan que no somos buenos y yo digo que s lo somos

4023452 i cant understand this whos discussing this youre discussing this
4023453 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4023454 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4023455 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4023456 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4023457 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4023458 as we continue to extend the features of the mediasmart server and plan the next release of the hardware its important for us to allow owners of the current version of the product to continue to benefit also were actively investigating supported options for users to upgrade their mediasmart servers memory
4023459 we need to work out what support users will need when they upgrade but you can expect to see a solution from us in the next 6 months or sooner
4023460 we wanted to create a really simple upper because the whole idea about the lunartrainer is that its light and uncomplicated and at the same time its a shoe you can run in big miles but its way lighter than most shoes that people would think about doing that with
4023461 we started to realize the relationship of the bottom of the upper because you have an upper thats holding the foot accurately when you put on firm outsoles they compromise the fit with a compliant moveable outsole you can actually feel the cable all the way around the foot instead of just landing on this hard plank on the bottom of your foot which causes the flywire upper to tent out to the side
4023462 pointed out that leaders at all levels must deeply understand that the struggle against the three forces is one of life or death
4023463 in xinjiang the fight against separatist forces is long term arduous and complex
4023464 stick to a strategy of seizing the initiative to strike pre emptively closely guard against and attack separatist sabotage by the three forces and never allow our enemies to gain strength
4023465 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4023466 ethnic unity and unity between the races must be preserved
4023467 if you leave a wallet full on money upon the ground most people will simply walk away with it instead of doing what is morally correct and returning it to the owner
4023468 putting consumers in the middle of billing disputes between providers and health plans is a terrible and unfair practice that must be stopped
4023469 with these new regulations my administration is protecting californians who have done the right thing by obtaining insurance but then later receive crushing medical bills that they should not owe these new regulations will offer consumers a place to seek help when they are caught in the middle and address the root cause of balance billing of course i continue to also call on the legislature to pass legislation that will prohibit this anti consumer practice altogether
4023470 todays court order means that the end is in sight for the 18 year old water war litigation concerning atlantas water withdrawals at lake lanier
4023471 the federal appellate court in washington has already validated alabamas position that atlantas future water supply plans violated federal law alabama believes that atlantas current withdrawals also violate federal law and we are pleased that the federal court has placed that issue on a fast track for resolution
4023472 the federal judge handling these cases has emphasized the need for the three states to work out a long term solution to this problem
4023473 he is certainly right and i remain ready to meet any time anywhere with governor perdue and governor crist to work toward an equitable agreement for sharing this vital natural resource the three states should reach an agreement but only if there is a recognition that each state has to make compromises
4023474 take back our highways is clearly working to save lives it has gotten real results there are people alive today because of this intensive highway safety effort we want the people of alabama to understand that when they travel their safety is our number one concern
4023475 we have saved more than 150 lives in the last 18 months because of the work of our state troopers with innovative programs like take back our highways we are making a difference for alabama
4023476 too many alabamians die or are seriously injured on our roadways in preventable crashes
4023477 too many motorists are the victims of drunken drivers and fully two thirds of the fatality victims troopers have responded to this year were not using seat belts
4023478 we will have troopers from every rank and every division including driver license and abi in uniform and on the road aug 18 25
4023479 thanks to governor riley adeca and forensic sciences troopers will be able to test suspected impaired drivers on the spot increasing effectiveness and saving both time and money
4023480 both are premium international brands so there is a nice synergy there how we bring that to life will be witty and credible
4023481 from a global brand perspective and how its associated with music sport and entertainment we have very strict criteria
4023482 one of those criteria is working closely with our brand partner
4023483 es normal que nos cueste porque estamos jugando ante equipos muy buenos y un torneo como ste es bastante duro llevamos tres victorias las tres por una buena diferencia la de china despu s de una pr rroga pero lo m s importante es que algunos jugadores vayan entrando y se preocupen por lo que hacen en cada momento entonces tendremos m s posibilidades de ganar a estados unidos o al que sea
4023484 los dem s est n bastante en la l nea s que nos importan estos dos jugadores que tienen mucho talento y para que puedan aportar de forma m s regular
4023485 aqu no hay la posibilidad de recuperarnos con dos tres d as de entrenamiento casi lo que tenemos que hacer es entrenar en los partidos
4023486 a estados unidos se le gana no dejando que te apabulle su potencia f sica en la defensa del uno contra uno hay que intentar sacar faltas cuando ellos presionan mucho haciendo penetraciones sin perder el bal n y en defensa tenemos que hacer la defensa en equipo porque pararlos individualmente es imposible nosotros tenemos m s h bito que ellos ellos hacen una presi n m s f sica pero individualmente
4023487 sin perder la cabeza si carlos jim nez no est en condiciones no hay que forzar porque todav a queda mucho torneo y nunca sabemos si jugar el cruce con uno u otro equipo es mejor hay que intentar tener h bitos para que luego te sirvan en el cruce
4023488 es intentar tener una buena intensidad la mayor parte del tiempo
4023489 contra grecia la tuvimos en un 90 por ciento y en estos dos partidos en un 70 intentaremos subirla a un 75 u 80 todo esto influye en los tiros libres de hoy lo que tenemos que hacer es elevar el ritmo y no preocuparnos por los tiros libres

4023493 you know in movies when people have babies in the back of cabs then drop off the lady and the baby at the hospital then pick up a new fare well you know that it is just made up because would you get into a cab that looked like this
4023494 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
4023495 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4023496 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4023497 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4023498 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4023499 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4023500 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4023501 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4023502 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4023503 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4023504 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4023505 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it

4023511 the members of the alaska legislature worked honorably and diligently in the past two months to deal with these critical issues facing our state i join with all alaskans in recognizing and thanking them for their accomplishments
4023512 after funding the states priorities putting billions away in savings and still seeing a budget surplus the legislature agreed to a special one time payment sharing part of our resource wealth with alaskans who under our constitution are the owners in common of these resources and who i believe can decide better than government how to use that share
4023513 legislators provided alaskans with a strong and diverse package of short term energy assistance
4023514 we can build on this good work as we bring forward a much more comprehensive energy package for consideration in the next regular session
4023515 it is also important to remember that all alaskans have a tool already available to them to help with high energy costs conservation
4023516 as alaskans prepare for winter there are some immediate steps that we can take to help reduce energy costs and lower the burden of these high prices
4023517 because of the wisdom and foresight of this legislature we can finally look ahead to actually bringing alaskas natural gas from the north slope to our homes to our businesses and to our fellow americans in the lower 48
4023518 this action represents a critical step toward the future of resource development for our state
4023519 we agreed it would be very good for us and the industry

4023541 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4023542 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
4023543 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4023544 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
4023545 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
4023546 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
4023547 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
4023548 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
4023549 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
4023550 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
4023551 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
4023552 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
4023553 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
4023554 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
4023555 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
4023556 im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
4023557 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
4023558 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4023559 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4023560 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4023561 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4023562 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4023563 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4023564 ricardo chavira hates kissing me we are both not really fond of the kissing scenes
4023565 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4023566 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4023567 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around

4023570 well we had all of the places filled until today 2 people dropped out and so im trying to find some replacements
4023571 their industries are under threat from climate change not environmentalism
4023572 the green party has a clear message the transition from high to low carbon economy has to have workers in the forefront of it
4023573 given it has to happen one way or another it can either be forced on us or we can manage it in the best way obviously its frightening to realise your industry will change but a post carbon economy will need lots of skills and human power so its very good news for a lot of workers these industries will be more labour intensive than the fossil fuels they are set to replace
4023574 was proud of all my players who worked very hard in trying conditions
4023575 disappointment aside i am proud of the work the players put in and i think we have developed as a team
4023576 matt mason has become an integral part of our squad since arriving in 2002 on the field he has had a tough 18 months but is now playing regularly with the first xi
4023577 he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4023578 over the last two seasons he has been mentoring our younger players on an informal basis and it is clear he has natural ability in this area
4023579 i am both proud and very excited to be given the opportunity to play and coach at the club next year
4023580 only three months ago i was wondering if i would ever play again so to be offered this combined role is more than i could ever have hoped for
4023581 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer and since returning to the first team i feel i proved that
4023582 coaching is something i am very passionate about and at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country
4023583 the images clearly show the intent of the offenders who tried to force their way behind the counter
4023584 thankfully no one was injured however the type of weapons used and the level of force shown in the attempted robbery demonstrates how dangerous these individuals are
4023585 i would ask anyone who may recognise the offenders from their clothing or who perhaps knows who is responsible comes forward and speaks to police
4023586 well son i guess one day you will need to find out anyway
4023587 what is clear is that the complete russian victory in this small but nasty war has created a new reality on the ground
4023588 not just in georgia but in relations between russia and the west

4023603 i knew that it was gonna make a splash but i didnt know that it was going to be such a huge cannonball
4023604 so im happy that it did im excited that it did

4023644 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were no 1 in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
4023645 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that

4023648 bob will contribute enormously to the state canterbury wizards and canterbury cricket and is the ideal person to continue the great work dave nosworthy has done
4023649 christchurch is my familys home and i am passionate about seeing canterbury at the forefront of cricket in new zealand
4023650 i have a strong desire and drive to coach at the international level and know that succeeding with canterbury will help me to achieve this goal
4023651 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
4023652 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
4023653 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place

4023677 i cannot stress enough how much i want to get out there and play for england
4023678 my family is from gujarat so it would be a big deal for me if i were picked to go on englands tour of india this winter i have got aunts and grandparents over there they would support me and of course ahmedabad would be a big match for me
4023679 since i got the call i have been thinking about how i would bowl at particular south african batsmen i have been visualising their shots and the way they play visualising what they would try to do
4023680 he has a great test record and one day record and youd be daft not to look at the way he bowls
4023681 hes been great he was really good i picked his brains he wasnt there at nottinghamshire for that long which is a shame but he is one of the top left arm spinners
4023682 i didnt believe it i just broke down into tears

4023698 all australians will enjoy the cultural benefits which will flow from the projects that receive these funds the dance festivals music television and radio productions the arts and crafts and the revival and strengthening of our indigenous languages
4023699 its very difficult to fill the space not only because of his contributions with the bat and ball but also because of his impact in the dressing room
4023700 we are not doing too badly its just we are losing the key games
4023701 we shouldnt be too high or too low in confidence well try to keep a positive frame of mind
4023702 we just need to make sure that we get our game plans right
4023703 its a culture which were proud of and we want to support
4023704 a culture which we know means not only everything to its own people but can communicate and entertain and enlighten and stimulate people right around the world
4023705 all australians will enjoy the cultural benefits the dance festivals television and radio productions the arts and crafts and the revival and strengthening of our indigenous languages
4023706 the funding being announced today will ensure those community arts centres continue to play that important role
4023707 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
4023708 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
4023709 it always seemed vaughan and fletcher were still close and certainly closer than vaughan and moores that is understandable but now there is a chance for pietersen and moores to create a bond
4023710 the whole thing is a little awkward for us and we would have preferred to do this in one announcement
4023711 the additional write downs here are all related to information we received from our accounting firm that says we need to look at our write down process differently nothing has happened to these securities in the last two weeks the applicable accounting has changed
4023712 as we get to year end we will see a lot of institutions take a lot of charges
4023713 the question to provident is have they taken all their medicine i wouldnt be surprised if they have to choke down a little more
4023714 the fortunate thing is they were advised prior to releasing their earnings

4023722 i have always believed that the name issue is solvable and that if we reach an agreement on the name it will open the way to solving many other issues
4023723 there are many issues between the two countries some of them are long term some are short term issues but i think both countries agree that the core issue is the name
4023724 there is a un resolution and an agreement between the two countries and my mandate is on the name issue
4023725 let me guess you must be ben get up now
4023726 the sustainable restoration of lake koroneia is very difficult and will have to be approached from many scientific angles while ensuring the protection of lake volvi which is also in an average ecological state and is in need of care
4023727 the artwork show demonstrates tibetan peoples wisdom and hardworking features
4023728 it also shows the countrys stepped up efforts in saving and developing traditional tibetan cultural heritages
4023729 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
4023730 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
4023731 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal wheres it going to go to
4023732 thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket
4023733 the opportunity to contribute to the further advancement of what is a very progressive and energetic university in one of the worlds most dynamic regions is extremely attractive to me and my family
4023734 i look forward to adding to the strengths of the university and the nation in research teaching and service
4023735 the service is very bad they cannot have so few staff for so many people
4023736 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
4023737 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
4023738 fred looks in good nick to me hes played well at six before so theres no reason at all why he cant play well at six again
4023739 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
4023740 on this showing at the oval it allows you to pressure the batters for longer which had quite a big influence on the game
4023741 att vi nu f tt byggnadslov inneb r att vi kan b rja den detaljerade byggnadstekniska och processtekniska planeringen f r pampalof rekomsten jag r mycket n jd med att vi kunnat anlita erfarna konsultbolag som hj lper oss med dessa arbeten
4023742 to peak to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4023743 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4023744 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4023745 but there are a few people who have come here to peak to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4023746 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4023747 we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas
4023748 manifest failure of the chinese government to keep their promises
4023749 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4023750 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4023751 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4023752 are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4023753 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area
4023754 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that he said
4023755 i think the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better what china is about
4023756 der er enighed om at lade sp rgsm let om et nyt hovedbibliotek indg som et element i de kommende budgetforhandlinger men det er nok ikke et projekt der st r foran en umiddelbar realisering dertil er udgifterne for h je men planen om at etablere et stort moderne og tidssvarende hovedbibliotek i k benhavn som afl ser for biblioteket i krystalgade er i hvert fald ikke d d
4023757 et nyt hovedbibliotek b r ogs omfatte et internationalt bibliotek med litteratur p de sprog som tales af mange af byens borgere
4023758 i am 16 years old and i cannot control what others are saying
4023759 my real age is 16 and what others say does not affect me
4023760 although i fell down in the qualification i became more confident today to make up for my mistake and i finally made it
4023761 our team made history today and proved to the world that we are the best
4023762 while choosing the roster for the finals we took into consideration all the accidents that may happen the gold medal is not only for the gymnastics team but also for the whole chinese delegation at the beijing games
4023763 after the failure at the athens games we reviewed our past training program carefully and decided to make some reforms
4023764 the chinese team used to train a lot but competed less which led to poor results in international competitions to improve their ability to compete and to strengthen their psychological power we sent more team members to compete abroad so they could bring a competitive spirit back to the team
4023765 all six gymnasts in the olympic team final were selected from fierce competition and they proved themselves today
4023766 todays final showed that gymnastics is a sport full of energy and excitement and it will be sure to arouse more peoples interest in it
4023767 the draft was an individual study by edibe sozen the content of the draft on the protection of youth law is not in accordance with the party program and the draft is not accepted and not approved by authorized bodies of our party
4023768 the statement suggests the party is taking the court verdict seriously
4023769 with a reduction in the cost of gasoline and food in the second half of 2008 and the slide of the euro it is expected that there will be a boost in consumer spending a rise in investment and a continuation of the positive impact net exports have on gdp growth
4023770 it is very difficult for such a large drop in building activity as seen in the last three quarters to continue in an economy where credit expansion in housing loans is 17 percent
4023771 s ar putea sa nu o prind si pe cea de 40 de ani dar 30 de ani e al naibii de bine iar serialul are inca foarte mult succes
4023772 although turkey doesnt like the present regime it has always tried to keep iranians both at bay and collaborate with them it is an extremely delicate balancing act and it will continue to be so
4023773 the visit is all about controlled risks and the most important aspect is a gas deal with iran not the nuclear program because turkey has little influence on that
4023774 ankara definitely does not sympathize with the theodemocracy theocracy partial democracy of iran but not having a hostile attitude against iran is important for turkeys domestic stability as well as its energy needs
4023775 will the visit really help turkey i doubt it its more beneficial for ahmadinejad hell get another 15 minutes in the spotlight when he unleashes his attacks against israel and the united states
4023776 we believe the prime ministers trips to moscow and tbilisi will contribute to securing a climate of sustainable peace and stability in the region
4023777 nothing went right today any great athlete can have an unlucky moment as happened to ilias iliadis today iliass elimination is just a brief interlude in the fantastic course that judo in greece has had over the last eight years
4023778 since we left japan it has been circled on my calendar
4023779 we get a chance to redeem ourselves everybody is excited everybody cant wait this is going to be our first test
4023780 its getting on two years now and we havent forgotten we are really looking forward to playing them
4023781 yeah we want to get them back the team that loses never forgets ever
4023782 they beat us its a bad feeling were looking to come out and get our revenge
4023783 basketball is such a global sport you really dont have to have nba players
4023784 were looking forward to it its a great opportunity to see how much weve improved since we last played them
4023785 its going to be exciting its the team that beat us in 2006 so we are looking forward to the challenge
4023786 its the only play they ran and they ran it to perfection so we dont expect them to do anything different come thursday
4023787 we were really young and i think a lot of us have grown and matured since then weve gotten a lot stronger
4023788 we have to stay focused stay calm and keep our heads they are going to be very emotional and we just need to play through that theyve been playing together for a long time and they know how to play the game
4023789 i wouldnt say we overlooked them we didnt know much about them
4023790 we didnt know what to expect by the time we realized we had to make some adjustments the game was over and we lost the game
4023791 now we have been working on it for the last two years i think we are much improved in defending the pick and roll now i think that greece game two years ago opened up our eyes and showed us some things that we had to work on
4023792 the families that were preparing to repossess their property cannot return since everything has been destroyed and those people have no means to do the repair work
4023793 we are giving top priority to such cases and all the major incidents in the past year have been solved
4023794 the government condemns these acts and demands that local authorities notably the police find the perpetrators and punish them
4023795 serbias military intelligence service is negotiating with war crimes fugitive ratko mladic on his surrender
4023796 the authorities are insisting that mladic must go to the hague without problems
4023797 what is a tank doing in front of the press center
4023798 if i am at risk from something i need to know what it is
4023799 were the fireworks we saw over beijing digitally produced for tv never actually exploding all over town
4023800 how many requests for protests inside the designated areas were filed with the authorities
4023801 what happened with the lead dancer who broke her neck during the rehearsals for the opening ceremony
4023802 with regard to possible subway accidents in the capital please follow the official line all food safety issues such as carcinogenic mineral water should not be broached in case of emergencies involving foreign tourists please follow the official line if theres no official line stay away from it
4023803 what is a tank doing in front of the press center
4023804 if we dont get the money by the end of the week we will start erecting barricades use stones stakes and manure to protest
4023805 a more serious offensive is still to come and they the government will eventually bear the responsibility for their negligence and inefficiency
4023806 we havent made a decision yet on whether to bid for austrian
4023807 we havent held direct talks yet but im not saying were not interested in the airline
4023808 find those who fired machine guns at the innocent children
4023809 the crime in gorazdevac must not be forgotten and the murderers must face justice
4023810 there were two athletes from croatia who were slightly injured
4023811 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4023812 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4023813 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4023814 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4023815 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4023816 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4023817 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4023818 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4023819 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4023820 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4023821 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4023822 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4023823 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4023824 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4023825 we tore it down at the same time of the storm there were no lights the building was falling down and shook the ground and the entire fire department came around here and some people were scared
4023826 compared to some of the hoops the city makes others jump through theyre not making this guy do anything
4023827 las perspectivas apuntan a una continuaci n de este proceso dependiendo del alcance del ajuste del empleo
4023828 es m s incierto que el de los ltimos trimestres
4023829 ha aumentado la probabilidad de que la fase bajista del ciclo de la econom a mundial se prolongue hasta 2009
4023830 cabe esperar que la trayectoria de recuperaci n del ahorro de las familia contin e en lo que resta de a o
4023831 permanecen en niveles que en ausencia del clima de deterioro de las perspectivas econ micas permitir an el desarrollo de nuevos planes de gasto
4023832 there is an expression in japanese which i am not quite sure how to translate into english
4023833 basically here in japan just like anywhere else there are some that japanese men dont want to date we let the foreigners go out with these women
4023834 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up with the jail psychiatrist
4023835 he was doing what every other teenager would be doing
4023836 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4023837 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4023838 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4023839 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4023840 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the
4023841 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4023842 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4023843 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4023844 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4023845 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4023846 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4023847 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4023848 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4023849 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across to get things done and one candidate that has not
4023850 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4023851 well yeah she was the greatest before today though dad
4023852 and we never see her use her cell phone like all the other moms down here
4023853 and she cooks good food and she lets me help
4023854 well i do it because i have to im not sending anyone back
4023855 i wish my mom dad wouldve worked more so that we had more things or more vacations
4023856 great article as single dad i find it hard to keep an eye on the kids all the time
4023857 our oldest who is four and a half saw a doctor who episode where there was a monster under the bed for weeks we had to check his room with him before he went to bed
4023858 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4023859 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
4023860 i can honestly say that since that first night when a tattered printed manuscript found its way to me thanks to one of my daughters my life has never been the same once you read it for yourself you will understand why

4023865 his outstanding record makes him an ideal partner for obama not only on the campaign trail but at the vital job of shaping americas future
4023866 richardsons record not only qualifies him to assume the presidency it makes him an ideal partner to the visionary and eloquent obama in the task of running this country and as a leading figure in a rocky mountain west that has emerged as a swing political region richardson could do more than any other possible running mate to carry the democratic ticket to victory in november
4023867 big events reveal smallness such as that of new mexicos gov bill richardson
4023868 on abcs this week richardson auditioning to be barack obamas running mate disqualified himself clinging to the obama campaigns talking points like a drunk to a lamppost richardson said this crisis proves the wisdom of obamas zest for diplomacy and that america should get the u n security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint apparently richardson was ambassador to the u n for 19 months without noticing that russia has a security council veto
4023869 bill richardson making obama look good on georgia by comparison
4023870 a president obama will have a good strong dialogue oriented relationship with russia where these kinds of situations would not occur
4023871 team obama has got to get bill richardson away from cameras

4023874 if you are a customer of the department of water and power or any metropolitan water district member agency waterworks district 29 you should demand that your district send a letter telling the mwd to remove hydrofluosilicic acid and its contaminants from the water
4023875 it is totally accurate to state that ingested fluoride provides no significant reduction in tooth decay however it is not accurate to say that fluoride does not reduce tooth decay as topically it can have an impact
4023876 in this case you can verify with the dwp if any funds were ever granted to cover the operations and maintenance or any significant amount of the capital improvement costs rate payers paid and continue to pay to have the water poisoned with a hazardous waste
4023877 instead why not help the plaintiffs who are now prepared to file a constitutional claim in federal court to protect our rights under the 9th and 14th amendments

4023880 the first day of school they sat and stood up in the bus there was no room
4023881 it scares you to death where is your kid there are so many kids how do you find your kid
4023882 they usually get picked up at 3 26 p m and she is not coming home until 4 30 in the afternoon
4023883 there maybe some buses where kids are standing and well make those adjustments it isnt because routes done in beginning its because we have late registering families
4023884 well make sure they are in the schools i will have them there by tomorrow
4023885 you know every year whether its the power lines or lightning you know back here we get fires a lot and you know that is a concern of ours with a gas well right there
4023886 i was telling dave that he was asking well howd you pick this location well we thought it was ideal

4023890 the research is abundant but the communication has been anything but clear on this subject
4023891 mercury is the second most deadly metal on the planet next to plutonium and it is my professional responsibility to alert the public to the fdas new guidelines
4023892 the roman empire died out from complications of lead poisoning from the lead in their plates and knives
4023893 i believe that we are now being as affected by mercury poisoning from fish local water and in unnecessary dental fillings
4023894 people depend on the fda to help protect their health its critically important that public health recommendations are based on sound scientific evidence
4023895 patients who have questions about the potential relation between mercury and degenerative diseases can be assured that the available evidence shows no connection
4023896 fluoride asbestos and pesticides all became political issues before people started seriously considering regulation
4023897 my hope is that proper education will alert our public to the dangers of mercury poisoning and what can be done about it its grassroots activity that will pressure the fda to ban this toxin from our environment
4023898 the heat of a dentists drill can vaporize mercury so strict protocols must be in place to remove fillings
4023899 there has long been controversy about mercury in fillings and i started to hear more about problems in the last five years
4023900 people worry about autism and carcinogens so i dont even use mercury amalgams with children i only offer composite fillings
4023901 the cost difference is not that much and i always tell my patients this is what i would do for my own child
4023902 but patients do have a right to know of available choices
4023903 but if a patient insists he wants the amalgam filling i ask him to sign a form saying that he has been informed the dangers and his choices
4023904 but we must emphasize a solution not just the problem i believe mercury is a ticking time bomb in our environment
4023905 even the least expensive toothpaste on the market has fluoride and the american dental association says thats enough
4023906 the scientific community fully supports fluoridation as safe and effective
4023907 swallowing fluoride makes as much sense as swallowing suntan lotion

4023914 we have over 50 years of good science that shows that fluoridated water is the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay in people

4024067 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and economic causes is being constantly overturned

4024076 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4024077 its hard when youre in a primary election losing is very very difficult
4024078 i think hillary clinton has been very gracious i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4024079 we can have a piece of offshore drilling but we have to renegotiate the terms
4024080 here we have big oil drilling getting the profits not paying the royalties we want to say in a very protected way you may be able to drill here in the context of a fuller package of renewables and when you do the taxpayers should benefit from that
4024081 i had to find a good medium with having fun and focusing for the event at the same time because its hard
4024082 i have a lot more years than these guys left so theres no pressure on me
4024083 the next olympics is one where ill have a little more pressure because hopefully ill be a bigger contender for a medal right here im just out having fun
4024084 hopefully ill qualify for the next olympics ill be older closer to the age of these guys and hopefully i can bring better stuff and be stronger
4024085 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4024086 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4024087 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4024088 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4024089 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4024090 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
4024091 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy
4024092 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4024093 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4024094 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4024095 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4024096 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4024097 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4024098 were on pace to be the most watched olympics ever
4024099 nbc has a dedicated soccer channel on cable and live stuff on nbcolympics com
4024100 most of nbcs increased audience came from people that werent watching tv three weeks ago
4024101 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4024102 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4024103 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4024104 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4024105 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4024106 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4024107 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4024108 my legs couldnt help trembling before the race and that has never happened to me before
4024109 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten i have been working for years and years thanks to everybody
4024110 today it was not about the silver medal or the world record it was about touching the wall
4024111 unfortunately bernard was faster in the final unfortunately i didnt go all the way
4024112 i probably used a little more energy than i should have in the first 50 meters i gave 100 per cent and it wasnt good enough
4024113 to bounce back after the relay takes a lot of guts full credit to alain he was the better man on the day
4024114 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4024115 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4024116 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4024117 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4024118 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4024119 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4024120 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4024121 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4024122 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4024123 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4024124 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4024125 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4024126 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4024127 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4024128 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4024129 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4024130 1950s bristol freighter plane fully refurbished into 2 beautiful self contained motel units
4024131 if the residence program is renewed i believe it will be 200 percent better
4024132 i think we are i cant speak for the usoc and we had a tough first week of the tournament
4024133 weve got jordan on board and were working with others in the middle east
4024134 were trying to go to countries where females dont participate in any sport and get them involved in our sport
4024135 there is criticism that the sport is dominated by a few countries which it is but i think the other programs are starting to get more competitive
4024136 i think its an exciting game our team is a very good team with some great ambassadors for their sport and for young kids theyve been great role models
4024137 hopefully the people the fans and everybody whos watching can look and say oh we play the game hard were not going to come out here and let up in any sport we play
4024138 come the gold medal game next week there is going to be emptiness
4024139 weve had hundreds of e mails from kids about their dreams its like we let them down thats why weve got to bring it back
4024140 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term
4024141 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4024142 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
4024143 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
4024144 retreat but dont run unless of course theyre chasing you and keep an eye on them as youre moving away it also can be a good idea to look for trees to climb or hide behind as they can easily outrun a human
4024145 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
4024146 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
4024147 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
4024148 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports
4024149 i went home and told my husband my life was over
4024150 shes a great team leader outstanding shes an amazing athlete
4024151 it was really fortunate to be in the first heat with britta steffen and libby trickett and have such a good heat to judge myself off of
4024152 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4024153 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4024154 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4024155 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4024156 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
4024157 they came here i think probably ill prepared by the their own government and left it up to us to do all the basic training
4024158 kiribati people are their own failures they werent motivated i couldnt get them to work
4024159 for the rest of this season ive decided no more
4024160 maybe in a few weeks ill do a few schoolboy tournaments or i might just play golf or something
4024161 ill teach you to show me the f ing red card you so and so
4024162 i sent off three team taranaki players in the last game of the central league season and there was no controversy over it at all really
4024163 the team had a whinge about it but all the spectators and officials said id got it right
4024164 hey hey damn yankee woh damn yankee hey hey damn yankee
4024165 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten i have been working years and years when i looked at the board i just thought wow i did it its a great joy to be here now i want to enjoy the moment
4024166 i think theres quite a bit of stress in the final
4024167 there is uncertainty you dont know if your body will react the way you want it to there is stress and you have to take all of that into account
4024168 im very happy i performed so well in my first olympic final unfortunately it wasnt good enough i probably used a little more energy than i should have in the first 50 meters i gave 100 percent and it wasnt good enough
4024169 my goal was to win the gold medal i came up short this is my first individual medal it feels really good whether its gold silver or bronze
4024170 obviously it doesnt top the relay from the other night
4024171 the huge mistake i made four years ago for taking the prelims too easy has been eating at me
4024172 ok im beaten by jason lezak i want to congratulate him for a fine performance
4024173 theres a lot of fair play in this sport you might be the best one day and you might be beaten the next
4024174 i have to put my mind in a little box and ignore the bad things going on around me
4024175 all your nerves go stupid when i tried to step on it it was a step on a non existent leg
4024176 it made me think i had to work harder to get back to where i was since then ive been working harder staying focused and correcting what i did wrong
4024177 especially at the trials he wanted to win there he was disappointed he was able to get himself back focused almost immediately he didnt run his race that whole race was based on what lashawn did and not what jeremy was doing
4024178 it was really important for him to have two opportunities after the trials to get him back
4024179 mark my words lashawn is going to run a personal best here hes ready to run 43 seconds hes a great athlete hes fast im still wondering why he isnt running under 44 seconds yet
4024180 jeremy is not making a lot of noise hes won everything there is to win in the last few years and hes young hes only 24
4024181 it felt good my last three workouts here im ready to go now my legs are fresh
4024182 its hard work to get a world record especially in track and field especially our world record the 43 18 by johnson its set so low i feel with how hard ive been working i have a chance to get the world record i keep thinking i can get it

4024186 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4024187 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4024188 has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that might have related to
4024189 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4024190 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4024191 theyll have to go some to top the brits who shinned up those poles
4024192 do you know the number eight is lucky in china thats why the opening ceremony was held on 8 8 2008
4024193 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
4024194 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community
4024195 hes not going to be over this injury for another year after he comes back
4024196 its difficult to win when youre not getting enough runs
4024197 but guys are working hard and our pitchers are battling
4024198 but sonnanstine did a good job of mixing it up keeping us off balance
4024199 i wanted to finish the game up because ive been out of too many games it hurt to swing i didnt really have a clue i was just trying to get through the at bat
4024200 its like an era closing down its like there go the good old days
4024201 they had big crowds and there were characters and everybody had a nickname
4024202 the newspapers had two pages of horse racing every day in the 1940s 50s and 60s more people watched horse racing than football baseball and basketball combined
4024203 one of the stewards let me up in his tower at the head of the stretch
4024204 i was a pilot in the navy during world war ii and a guy took me to the races at bay meadows
4024205 william p kyne invited us to come into his special room where we had lunch and free drinks and also made a few bets that got me hooked
4024206 when i got out of the navy and was working in the late 1940s i bought a horse a 10 000 claimer and started him the next day and he won i bought a second horse took him to seattle and he won a stakes so that was two horses i bought and they both won first time out that would nail anybody to the game
4024207 youre looking at a lot of traditions a lot of good horses
4024208 its a good place to train your horses ive always loved to train there because its so close to home we raised both of our sons steve and alan there and im probably going to wind up selling my home
4024209 well all miss it but to some extent ive been reconciled to this for years
4024210 it was inevitable that it would be developed because the underlying business of racing is not as good as it used to be
4024211 we definitely want to preserve the tradition of bay meadows
4024212 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4024213 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4024214 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4024215 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4024216 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4024217 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4024218 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4024219 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4024220 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4024221 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4024222 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4024223 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4024224 i was a natural left hander as a kid but i wanted to play other positions shortstop third base catcher
4024225 so when i was 10 years old my brother michael taught me how to throw right handed he was a third baseman four years older than me got to double a with the twins i started throwing right handed it came easy to me
4024226 i dont think they have a reason to throw at me so im not sweating that i think theyre trying to pitch me in and the ball got away
4024227 i was getting myself out i was swinging at pitches i should be hitting not missing
4024228 ive got to go down there to fresno and get it together
4024229 im surprised i think i played good for this team it was the first year i played third base
4024230 were giving these kids every opportunity we can until we have a better idea where were at
4024231 no one knows my name but they know the other three
4024232 if teams key on them ill be able to create some havoc if i establish myself the other three will put up stats that are off the charts
4024233 a normal viewer would see what he does in practice and think oh hes the man
4024234 but it takes a lot more than athleticism to get and stay on the field you have to do it every down every play and hes finally gotten into that mode a mode in which hes dominating on almost every play
4024235 i always thought if i ran really fast and hit really hard i would win but now im matched up with tackles who are 6 foot 6 and 325 pounds
4024236 thompson has us up here studying at 6 30 a m three days a week and you better not let him know you have free time because hell have you up here again
4024237 he understands his importance to what were doing and hes up for it

4024241 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4024256 the obligatory drilling could not be carried out because of circumstances beyond our control
4024257 the consortium is currently making various efforts in order to get the licence extended or obtain a new licence
4024258 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
4024259 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through that adjustment
4024260 real wage growth is heavily negative which coupled with the rise in unemployment will continue to constrain purchasing power
4024261 this is very worrying for consumer spending and will help to increase the probability of a technical uk recession even further
4024262 the government will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target
4024263 we had expected the first rate cut to come in q1 and the risk was a pre christmas cut we now think the risk scenario is the base case and the first cut comes in november
4024264 we expect easing will be mostly backloaded probably from q2 2009 onwards given the inflation profile rather than imminent
4024265 of course delayed easing adds to downside risks to growth but that may well be necessary to re anchor inflation expectations and return inflation to target
4024266 it should be stable they were very pleased following surgery its all up to the rehab now but they feel he should do very well
4024267 that car was pretty powerful and it wasnt close to what they race in
4024268 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4024269 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4024270 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4024271 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4024272 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4024273 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4024274 i dont know why you are running this marathon when you know you arent going to win

4024287 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4024288 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

4024292 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4024293 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4024294 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4024295 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4024296 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4024297 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4024298 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4024299 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4024300 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4024301 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4024302 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4024303 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4024304 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4024305 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4024306 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4024307 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4024308 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4024309 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4024310 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4024311 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4024312 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4024313 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4024314 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4024315 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4024316 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4024317 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4024318 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4024319 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4024320 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4024321 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4024322 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4024323 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4024324 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4024325 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4024326 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4024327 katakan kita tinggal di kuala lumpur kita beritahu kepada seekor semut kita akan pergi ke sabah pada pandangan semut itu adakah perkara ini logik sudah tentu tidak kerana ia berada di luar jangkauan pemikiran semut itu tetapi sebenarnya kita boleh memperjalankan semut tersebut ke sabah dengan membawanya menaiki kapal terbang

4024331 some countries play by the rules and some countries dont
4024332 its hard knowing well its hard being the one who makes the mistakes
4024333 alicia kept telling us she was sorry she didnt make the mistakes on purpose shes human shes not a robot
4024334 when they came up with computer scoring it really did not help us
4024335 most of our trainers are professional people who train their kids in a professional style that style does not do well internationally
4024336 when you have an argument with him doesnt he call people and tell them i hate him the difference is that these guys have access to the press and so when they say i hate him everybodys hearing it
4024337 everythings good hes a good guy were going to get through this not just me but our whole team
4024338 assist in the investigation detection and prosecution of serious crime
4024339 the serious criminals may be far more savvy than your normal joe blow and the information we collect for them is not going to be of the same calibre
4024340 biasanya dalam pilihanraya ada ceramah sahaja jadi kita merancang untuk menyampaikan mesej melalui sastera pula
4024341 kata kata rangsangan diberi ibu zain kepada wanita suatu ketika dahulu perlu dihayati oleh ahli politik terutamanya wanita dan puteri umno
4024342 kekurangan di dalam pelaksanaan praktek kontrak itu yang sekarang akan kita benahi saya rasa spirit dan tujuan baik dari pengusaha maupun pemerintah sama
4024343 jadi saya kira sudah clear semua dikembalikan kepada kontraknya kita lihat kontrak di generasi pertama apa apa yang memang sudah diputuskan di sana dan memang selama ini prakteknya seperti apa
4024344 kpu tidak bisa membatalkan keputusan uu akhirnya mereka cuma memutuskan untuk mengumumkan tapi menurut saya kpu tidak boleh hanya sekedar mengumumkan yang gagal memenuhi syarat tapi siapapun yang jadi caleg perempuan hendaknya ditempatkan di nomor urut satu atau dua
4024345 saya kira parpol dapat beban ya artinya parpol terlalu terbeban dengan uu yang seperti ini terlalu progresif dan terlalu liberal tapi saya kira parpol juga yang bikin masalah ngapain juga dia ikut pemilu kalau dia tidak siap
4024346 mana ada orang yang mau bertaruh kehilangan karir dan pekerjaannya kehilangan rekan rekannya hanya karena dia terjun ke dunia politik sementara di politik dia belum tentu mendapatkan apa apa

4024349 we were working with the same producer in new york city at the end of my trip it was just when i first started going to new york and not really knowing anybody i was like please god somebody take me out
4024350 so i made him take me out all his friends were there and we ended up dancing and making out on the dancefloor
4024351 his art really speaks to people on a direct emotional level because although its simple in form it has a lot of emotional meaning it reminds people of why john was significant and what he stood for
4024352 i knew that it was gonna make a splash but i didnt know that it was going to be such a huge cannonball
4024353 so im happy that it did im excited that it did
4024354 they say the stage is an actors revenge and it truly is
4024355 really rap was the start of any music oftentimes what we call rap today is a rhythmic percussive manner by which someone delivers a message i have my message i am delivering it in rhythmic and percussive manner but more melodic every song is rap
4024356 e has always been blueish green so im always painting pictures with them when you see the transition from the flute to the trumpet to the saxophone to the upright bass and then to the viola thats my way of going through a rainbow
4024357 they had the prettiest grass in the neighbourhood you could not touch his lawn and you did not try to talk to his daughter she was my very very best friend but her father stopped letting us be close to each other its half reality and half what i wish id had the courage to say at 14 but didnt
4024358 but recently i sat down with the young man and his parents and i saw what my daughter liked about him
4024359 in a one hour conversation his eyes did not leave my eyes
4024360 i love her forever i am connected and tied to her
4024361 a river flows down whatever avenue is afforded it if you limit artistry to one avenue its no longer artistry it becomes discipline and the imagination disappears from it even though ive never published a book in my mind i am a writer maybe that river is still a bit frozen
4024362 i bought a flute the other day ive never been able to make a flute make even a small noise but i know i can play that flute
4024363 the entire purpose of being alive being awake is emotional attachment
4024364 for me it was unthinkable to bring a very good polish opera without bringing russian ones too
4024365 it was clear my work with the london symphony orchestra would limit my appearances with the mariinsky in london and my mariinsky work with unusual programmes was quite liked in london so i felt that going to edinburgh would be a good thing
4024366 its true that the russian operas are based on novels or romances by big writers pushkin leskov katayev but for me its the musical value of having young rachmaninov or very mature prokofiev or an opera from a new millennium we wanted a group of operas that travels across time in music
4024367 i really dont know why aleko isnt done more often maybe you need a tom hampson or a hvorostovsky to take it up and two big name singers to be attracted to it and semyon kotko is mature prokofiev its very important to do it again after we presented it in london in 2000 there will be 95 per cent of people who dont know how good this opera is especially the third act which is really phenomenal
4024368 im sure shchedrins opera will stand very confidently around the world
4024369 this other stuff is a product of those propaganda wars those boring people who dont hear the music and look and try to see who was relatively close to political process its a non starter like calling semyon kotko prokofievs soviet opera yes it is not the prokofiev who was a young man in paris or chicago it was written after he came back to the country in which he was born that is the music
4024370 its what i promised well bring them all to london the barbican in 2009 theyre waiting already composed most of them
4024371 something unusual from russia again basically i felt that just doing mahler symphonies in london might be interesting for me and my orchestras but for the public there is no extra message
4024372 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4024373 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4024374 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again
4024375 were going to have to move after were done filming the hills news season
4024376 lo lauren bosworth was walking down the street one day and they were like here on the left we have a celebrity dog walker walking chloe
4024377 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4024378 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4024379 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4024380 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4024381 ricardo chavira hates kissing me we are both not really fond of the kissing scenes
4024382 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4024383 if they are nagging and annoying youre like go away
4024384 were not ever really with people cause sic were always travelling
4024385 banken in usa und in europa sind potenzielle verk ufer weil sie unter kapitaldruck stehen und schnell geld beschaffen m ssen
4024386 die ereignisse an den kreditm rkten werden wegen der steigenden kapitalnot die verkaufsaktivit ten beschleunigen denn asset management ist nicht das kerngesch ft der banken
4024387 die j ngsten akquisitionen mit signifikanten pr mien haben unsere einsch tzung best rkt dass die derzeitigen bewertungen im biotech sektor beraus attraktiv sind
4024388 biotech firmen machen erst sieben prozent des weltweiten gesundheitssektors aus doch bereits jedes zweite neu zugelassene arzneimittel stammt aus der innovativen biotech industrie
4024389 biotechnologie werte sind anfang des jahrtausends mit dem markt gefallen haben aber den kursaufschwung nach ende der new economy nicht in vollem umfang mitgemacht
4024390 ein generika fonds kann daher eine sinnvolle erg nzung zu einem biotechnologie fonds sein
4024391 you may have seen the recent announcements about dns cache poisoning and the potential effect of this on all kinds of internet based applications security one area in which it can have a particularly significant impact is openid

4024396 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4024397 he said to me honey dont come back because you cant get in
4024398 i think the other dog ran under the table or something
4024399 peoples cars are gone peoples homes are gone the whole buildings gone theres nothing to go back to so where do you go from here
4024400 we made 80 sandwiches and ran them down to the firefighters
4024401 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4024402 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4024403 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
4024404 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4024405 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4024406 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4024407 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4024408 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4024409 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
4024410 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4024411 one of the steps that has long been required has been the establishment of a proper embassy for syria and lebanon and vice versa
4024412 we must ensure that all of our countrys security measures are attuned to the increased threat we face during this time of transition and that we respond and adjust appropriately
4024413 help in the bureaus transformation into an elite national security agency
4024414 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4024415 all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4024416 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
4024417 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
4024418 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4024419 juffrouw ik heb mijn boekje uit mag ik een nieuwe pakken
4024420 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
4024421 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
4024422 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
4024423 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
4024424 the iraqi people are not ready to take over for themselves
4024425 iraqis do not yet know how to run a government and it is going to take some time to make this government function
4024426 a person like me whos totally with my children all day its great to open my eyes to whats going on to get involved
4024427 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public
4024428 hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4024429 one thing we do were asking people to volunteer for the campaign
4024430 if you are i will make note of it we always need extra help were building teams right now
4024431 what would the point be if we got the word out to our supporters and only people who are politically active came down
4024432 we thought it would serve more of a purpose to talk to people who were just here but may be interested in whats going on and may have a question to ask
4024433 we have a lot at stake in our relationships in many circumstances we look to peoples reputation to decide whether to trust them
4024434 i think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy i feel it is possible that dell will grow faster than the industry
4024435 when we evaluated our position said okay we need to reboot the dell operating system
4024436 what you are seeing is kind of a new dell that is emerging
4024437 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4024438 it is expected that total research and development expenses will remain constant over the next two years as the maestro 01 and mindset 01 clinical trials near completion and maestro 02 and maestro 03 increase in number of patients under treatment
4024439 kinross reported a strong quarter unlike most of the senior gold producers
4024440 changes in consumer behaviour have essentially erased five years of growth in gasoline demand
4024441 the emerging markets are a big part of our growth
4024442 i used to try and explain who i am ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
4024443 senator i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator you are no jack kennedy

4024445 hp engineers have created a fun engaging and simple touch experience for the home
4024446 hp touchsmart pcs will allow users to interact with photos videos music and games
4024447 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4024448 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4024449 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4024450 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4024451 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4024452 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4024453 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4024454 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4024455 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
4024456 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
4024457 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4024458 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
4024459 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
4024460 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

4024464 she was concerned i think that with the military doing more humanitarian work there comes a blurring of the lines and there is a danger of making humanitarian workers targets or seen as legitimate targets by people like the taliban
4024465 especially with children we used to joke that i have to compete with the millions of girls who go without school because of conflict
4024466 my sister was one of the few people who were happier in places without electricity or running water
4024467 she felt a true calling to completely give herself to great causes afghanistan needed humanitarian assistance so thats where she went
4024468 she would have probably gone to afghanistan on her vacation if she could

4024480 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4024481 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
4024482 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
4024483 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

4024494 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
4024495 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
4024496 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
4024497 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
4024498 support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
4024499 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
4024500 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support

4024530 pfuel was one of those hopeless opinionated arrogant men who would go to the stake for their own ideas self assured as only a german can be because only a german could be self assured on the basis of an abstract idea science the supposed knowledge of absolute truth
4024531 a russian is self assured because he knows nothing and doesnt want to know anything because he doesnt believe you can know anything completely a self assured german is the worst of the lot the most stolid and the most disgusting because he imagines he knows the truth through a branch of science that is entirely his invention pfuel was one of those theorists who love their theory so dearly they lost sight of the aim of all theory which is work out in practice he positively rejoiced in failure because failure was due to practical infringements of his theory which went to show how right the theory was

4024536 the analysis by duarte et al of the lagar velho childs skeleton is a brave and imaginative interpretation of which it is unlikely that a majority of paleoanthropologists will consider proven
4024537 when you look at all of the well dated and diagnostic early modern european fossils there is a persistent presence of anatomical features that were present among the neandertals but absent from the earlier african modern humans
4024538 early modern europeans reflect both their predominant african early modern human ancestry and a substantial degree of admixture between those early modern humans and the indigenous neandertals
4024539 as such microcephalin shows by far the most compelling evidence of admixture among the human loci examined thus far speculation about the identity of the archaic homo population from which the microcephalin d allele introgressed into the modern human gene pool points to the neanderthal lineage as a potential although by no means only candidate anatomically modern humans and neanderthals shared a long period of coexistence from as early as 130 000 years ago in the middle east 39 to as late as 35 000 years ago in europe 40 consistent with the estimated introgression time of the microcephalin d allele at or sometime before approx 37 000 years ago furthermore the worldwide frequency distribution of the d allele exceptionally high outside of africa but low in sub saharan africa 29 suggests but does not necessitate admixture with an archaic eurasian population finally our estimate of the separation time between d and non d alleles i e approx 1 100 000 years with a lower bound confidence interval of approx 530 000 years is largely consistent with the divergence time between modern humans and neanderthals based on mitochondrial dna mtdna sequence difference 320 000 740 000 years refs 41 and 42 and with the earliest appearance of neanderthals in the fossil record approx 500 000 years ago 43 it would be of great interest to sequence the microcephalin locus in neanderthals or other archaic homo lineages should it become technically feasible to retrieve and analyze nuclear dna from ancient hominid remains our results not only provide genetic evidence in support of the possibility of admixture between modern humans and an archaic homo lineage but also support the notion that the biological evolution of modern humans might have benefited from the contribution of adaptive alleles from our archaic relatives in the case of microcephalin it is all the more intriguing given the fact that the adaptive allele is associated with an important brain development gene
4024540 the out of africa replacement theory has always been a big controversy
4024541 i set up a null hypothesis and the program rejected that hypothesis using the new data with a probability level of 10 to the minus 17th in science you dont get any more conclusive than that it says that the hypothesis of no interbreeding is so grossly incompatible with the data that you can reject it

4024544 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
4024545 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
4024546 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
4024547 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black
4024548 ive only had one test match under my belt as a starting nine and so its hard to get a gauge at this stage but yeah im pretty happy with where i am at the moment but it is only the early stages all the same so im not getting too far ahead of myself

4024630 airing the black communities dirty laundry for all to see is detrimental to the state of the community though we concur it is already in a dismal state by shedding light on these issues publicly you are essentially legitimizing them and have sealed their continuance
4024631 freeing the white man of his responsibilities towards the lower class black citizens will result in an even worse situation
4024632 but should whites really have to take responsibility for blacks unwillingness to move forward on their own does that even make sense

4024646 i feel too foolish i didnt even read any of the stories about the puppy deaths
4024647 the puppy was in a straw basket with big sunflowers and it was hard to resist
4024648 i had agreed to meet her at the ferry wharf in pictou county and i was going to pay 900 for the puppy
4024649 pulled the puppy out of her purse and put her on my knees and it just looked sick
4024650 i called the office for the veterinarian and the person who answered the phone was very leery and asked me if the papers were photocopied
4024651 i told her they were and she asked me dont you read the papers and then told me red light
4024652 i had my little nine year old sister with me and she was beginning to cry because this woman was so insistent and because my little sister wanted the puppy
4024653 finally this guy flew out of the van and started screaming at me
4024654 they then got in the van and stormed off and i called the spca and reported what happened but it wasnt until i got home and googled her name that i found out about the dead puppies
4024655 look this is big business and there is a lot of money to be made if people keep buying this way

4024695 we are getting complaints from some of our people too i had someone come into my office and say that he didnt understand why we were going to trainings that teach us to work better with the japanese when it should be the other way around and they should be learning how to work better with us i just dont understand why everyone just assumes that this is such a gigantic cultural ordeal and it doesnt occur to anyone that these guys just are not very happy about whats going on with these companies right now i mean why is it that it doesnt occur to anyone that maybe the japanese are just not in the best mood about their company being taken over
4024696 ci sono tre modi di fare le cose quello giusto quello sbagliato e quello di max power
4024697 supports historical decision of the georgian government and people to leave cis we support georgias political development and true value of human rights and freedoms
4024698 cis is a club of authoritarian leaders situation in the caucasus manifests that russia is not going to give up its imperial habits this is why for such small countries like georgia or kyrgyzstan it is crucial to stand up for their own independence and strive for human rights
4024699 basically could not do anything to prevent this tragedy from happening
4024700 how can the countries in the alliance to act so irresponsibly towards another cis member
4024701 on the opposite the union will get stronger it is clear that nowadays it is very hard to survive on your own countries have to cooperate

4024703 it is important that effective training is conducted prior to international assignments as in many circumstances you only have one time to make a good first impression and this first impression will determine how successful you are at accomplishing your goals in the asia
4024704 securing a business license landing a distribution deal even finding that coveted colonial villa in shanghai fortunes have been made and lost based on whether the seeker has good or bad guanxi
4024705 in china there is much more emphasis on socialization and interpersonal relationships and they are directly connected to business in order to do business with them you need to have the relationship and support of the asian colleagues or you will not get anything done you may think that you get things done but information will be difficult to come by and it may not be as valid and originally thought in general it is my perception that asian cultures do not trust based companies mainly because it is their belief that it is all about profits whereas in the we are challenged by understanding the asian culture because they do not have the same sense of urgency around business problems
4024706 it is critical to develop personal relationships with asian counterparts
4024707 it is customary to go out and have drinks karaoke and socialize with your counterparts outside of the workplace this social interaction will allow much more business possibilities and will lessen the amount of hesitation and tension with your project partners
4024708 some jobs are exaggerated by the job title and do not have the same true responsibilities us based companies have and in addition the organizational charts do not indicate the personal relationships of key employees in the company moreover i have found that on many occasions some asian countries do not even have job titles or if they do generic job title assigned to them are very ambiguous and generic especially in the general work force
4024709 as many asian companies have found successes in areas that were previously a dominated by the west companies are more sensitive to the way we are perceived in this shrinking globalizing world at the end of the day we can conclude that although there are some glaring differences between the way we each see the world and how we make decisions we need to overcome our differences in order to attain common goals and succeed in todays and tomorrows competitive world of international business

4024718 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
4024719 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
4024720 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
4024721 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
4024722 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
4024723 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
4024724 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper

4024887 in my mind i felt it was a good opportunity to mend the rural urban split
4024888 this is a project that benefits everybody in this municipality so its an opportunity to use the differences to build bridges of understanding
4024889 this is a good news story for the farmers market and hrm
4024890 in keeping with our economic cultural environmental and immigration strategies the market aligns itself perfectly with our goal of uniting our communities and providing opportunities for new vendors in the urban core
4024891 basically were giving a 1 million grant from a newly formed grant program without inviting applications
4024892 it certainly gives the impression that you have a program created to fund this specific project and the optics of that are really bad
4024893 was primarily the result of advertising revenue growth in the classified category
4024894 overall revenue growth for the quarter was lower than we were expecting largely the result of lower spending levels by some of our national advertisers
4024895 given the uncertain economic outlook our initial full year advertising revenue growth forecast of between two and three per cent is less likely to be achieved
4024896 we do have to go to the market to raise the money and market conditions arent really robust right now
4024897 if we know more about the employee who is working for us now then we can provide them with the elements of work so that they will be engaged in the work
4024898 you can be satisfied at work which would mean im happy with the pay im happy with what im doing
4024899 but if you understand what people require from types of work for them to be engaged then you dont have these people who are going from job to job and treating you like a disposable employer
4024900 we are a system of hiring that is designed to attract more people to apply as well as to get great information about the person while were hiring them
4024901 if you dont fit its very difficult to be as productive as possible and happy
4024902 fifty per cent of the people leave the workforce because of incompatibility with their supervisor
4024903 its something that if were not addressing we cant retain as many people
4024904 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4024905 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4024906 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4024907 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4024908 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
4024909 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
4024910 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
4024911 wi fi helps make the internet more accessible to people
4024912 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
4024913 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
4024914 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
4024915 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
4024916 one of the earliest municipalities to embrace it and develop it was fredericton in new brunswick
4024917 if you come to fredericton it looks like any town except that you see people all over the place with their equipment and theyre happily connecting for free
4024918 it was sold as we will put it in and it will be free
4024919 but if you put together some wi fi hot spots at the corner coffee shop that doesnt mean you can do the network for a whole metropolitan area wi fi was never designed to cover a big urban area
4024920 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4024921 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4024922 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4024923 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4024924 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes
4024925 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4024926 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4024927 we amp squo ve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4024928 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia students shocked
4024929 we have taken decisive actions to align our infrastructure and improve operating efficiencies across the company
4024930 although a more meaningful contribution will come once all initiatives are implemented
4024931 this is one of the first applications of fbgs for biomedical pressure measurements
4024932 our sensor can resolve low magnitudes of disc pressure accurately and repeatedly while maintaining the key attributes of fbgs such as biocompatibility and small size
4024933 by constructing the sensor in this manner it is possible to maintain small sensor size and also increase pressure sensitivity by a factor of seven compared with a conventional bare fbg
4024934 we are also developing other fbg based medical pressure sensors that are even smaller and more sensitive than this device
4024935 our latest prototype is 20 times more sensitive than a bare fbg and has a major diameter of only 200 microns
4024936 its very disturbing to note that the minister has yet to comment on the matter although so much has transpired
4024937 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
4024938 right now theres a war in georgia and people are dying
4024939 im lucky that im alive first of all and lucky i can come and do my sport at the olympics it really sucks to lose its so painful but it doesnt make me more worthy or less worthy as a person its really just a match
4024940 were still checking things i will tell you that nothing is final yet all i can tell you is if everything is lined up we will go to instant replay at some point
4024941 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
4024942 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4024943 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
4024944 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
4024945 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
4024946 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
4024947 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
4024948 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
4024949 we can fill up a barrel in one rainstorm and so it seems a waste to just let it fall into the gravel
4024950 obviously if you use the water upstream it wont be there for the person to use it downstream
4024951 utahs the second driest state in the nation our water laws ought to catch up with that
4024952 if she really does that then she ought to have a water right to do it
4024953 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored

4024957 es el primer esfuerzo a gran escala hasta ahora se han ido haciendo reparaciones peri dicas pero el problema es tan grande que supera al hollywood historic trust

4024959 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4024960 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4024961 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4024962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4024963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4024964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4024965 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4024966 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4024967 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4024968 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4024969 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4024970 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4024971 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4024972 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4024973 cest comme un reportage sur des animaux dans la jungle
4024974 f r mich pers nlich war das tor super aber viel wichtiger ist der erfolg der mannschaft
4024975 hansa bietet ein tolles umfeld ich bin super aufgenommen worden und f hle mich einfach wohl
4024976 er bt viel druck auf den gegner aus und gewinnt im mittelfeld viele zweik mpfe
4024977 die gypter haben gute sch tzen wir haben aber gezeigt dass wir k mpfen k nnen leider hat meine stimme in der hektik etwas gelitten
4024978 als schulnote w rde ich ein ausreichend geben wir m ssen aber schnell zu einem befriedigend kommen
4024979 ich wollte ihm eigentlich die m glichkeit geben seinen fehler auf dem feld wieder gutzumachen aber glandorf hat sehr stark und stabil gespielt da musste ich nicht wechseln
4024980 mit uns ist auch nach den ausf llen zu rechnen wir stehen fast sicher im viertelfinale dort geht es dann erst richtig los uns darf man nicht abschreiben
4024981 das muss man erst mal verkraften das ist so als ob bei den franzosen narcisse karabatic und fernandez ausfallen wir sind aber als mannschaft gefestigt
4024982 es hat aber nichts zu bedeuten dass wir sie in der vorbereitung zweimal geschlagen haben sie sind k rperlich sehr stark sie machen aber auch technische fehler so dass wir ber gegenst e zum erfolg kommen k nnen

4024990 theyre still best friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4024991 were so happy its just the best feeling being with billy i really missed him we realised were at our happiest when we our together
4024992 glad she got back together with him to give things another go it just wasnt to be
4024993 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4024994 there is no truth to this rumour its an old one wasnt true then or now madonna is starting her tour in a week
4024995 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities
4024996 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4024997 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4024998 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4024999 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4025000 oilexco had a very good first half of 2008 achieving record financial results and continuing our strong track record with the drill bit in particular the company had another major exploration success at moth our second in a year following the huntington discovery in 2007 we are set for an active second half with seven appraisal and production wells due to be drilled and the shelley development due to come onstream we will also be progressing activities on our key 2009 development projects

4025009 we have collaborated with the rock solid images team on numerous of our exploration initiatives in west africa including ghanas jubilee field we have been impressed with their commitment to technical excellence and customer satisfaction and are pleased to select them for this important role
4025010 it has been an immensely satisfying experience to have collaborated with kosmos energy and tullows world class exploration teams since 2003 we are especially delighted that our rock physics and seismic inversion services have contributed in part to the discovery of one of west africas largest oil fields the jubilee field offshore ghana and that we have been chosen to assist with the delineation and development of the field
4025011 there is a total agreement with the club and the player for him to continue with us for the next five seasons
4025012 we have not listened to any offer for him we have always expressed the opinion and the desire that he stays with us
4025013 das bringt der it gegen ber dem business auch eine bessere verhandlungsposition
4025014 la derrota ante china nos ha hecho mucho da o en lo moral sab amos que equipos como estados unidos italia y bulgaria estaban fuera de nuestro alcance pero ten amos una gran esperanza en derrotar a china y a jap n y poder pasar a la siguiente fase
4025015 tras perder ante china con decisiones arbitrales injustas estamos desanimados porque ahora es muy dif cil conseguir el objetivo
4025016 italia no fue muy superior a nosotros en ninguno de los aspectos del juego pero demostr saber competir y tener una gran experiencia en los juegos ol mpicos nosotros es la primera vez que venimos a una cita tan importante como esta y se not en los momentos decisivos
4025017 hemos venido aqu con muchos problemas internos y ahora que las derrotas se est n acumulando est n saliendo a la luz y as es muy dif cil hacer nada deber amos estar centrados en jugar y en disfrutar de esta experiencia nica que es competir en unos juegos ol mpicos y sin embargo todos tenemos la cabeza en otras cosas
4025018 dan bergaullah kamu dengan mereka isteri kamu dengan cara yang baik kemudian jika kamu berasa benci kepada mereka kerana tingkah lakunya janganlah kamu terburu buru menceraikannya kerana boleh jadi kamu bencikan sesuatu sedangkan allah hendak menjadikan pada apa yang kamu benci itu kebaikan yang banyak untuk kamu
4025019 mana mana lelaki yang bersabar di atas keburukan perangai isterinya allah akan berikannya pahala seperti yang diberikan kepada ayyub kerana bersabar di atas bala yang menimpanya dan mana mana isteri yang bersabar di atas keburukan perangai suaminya allah akan berikannya pahala seperti yang diberikan kepada asiah binti muzahim isteri firaun
4025020 kalau beginilah keadaan umar seorang amirulmukminin yang selalu keras dan tegas maka bagaimana dengan aku
4025021 wahai amirulmukminin aku datang untuk mengadu mengenai perangai isteriku yang buruk dan suka berleter kepadaku tadi aku mendengar isteri anda pun begitu juga lalu aku berkata kepada diriku kalau begini keadaan amirulmukminin dengan isterinya maka bagaimana dengan aku
4025022 wahai saudaraku sesungguhnya aku bersabar mendengar leterannya kerana dia mempunyai hak ke atas aku
4025023 sesungguhnya dia memasak makanan aku mengadun roti untuk aku membasuh pakaian aku dan menyusui anakku padahal semua itu tidak diwajibkan ke atasnya
4025024 dia juga menenangkan hatiku daripada melakukan perbuatan yang haram zina sebab itulah aku bersabar dengan kerenahnya
4025025 maka bersabarlah wahai saudaraku sesungguhnya kerenahnya itu tidak lama hanya seketika saja
4025026 argentina tiene pocas posibilidades de obtener medallas pero vamos a pelear para conseguirlas
4025027 cuando estaba mal me daba verg enza salir a la calle pero hoy estoy bien y se lo debo a mis hijas
4025028 pas momentos muy duros pero ahora me levanto todas las ma anas l cido con ganas de llamar a mis hijas hoy estoy fenomenal cr anme que estoy pasando un momento de alegr a maravilloso
4025029 lo disfruto m s con muchos a os encima pero lo disfruto hoy hablo de todo con mis compa eros en las concentraciones los entrenamientos todo es m s relajado
4025030 antes los partidos de f tbol pasaban como un f rmula uno y cada domingo rend as examen pero el showbol se vive de otra manera y eso hace que hoy me sienta feliz de estar en una cancha
4025031 hay que entrar en la cancha con hambre de ganar
4025032 italia es italia y ya sab amos que iba a ser muy dif cil ganar pero tenemos que entrar en la cancha con hambre de ganar italia no ha sido muy superior a nosotros pero nos ha vencido incluso con relativa facilidad porque tiene m s experiencia en este tipo de torneos y partidos
4025033 estamos jugando un buen voleibol pero nos falta un poco m s quiz si todos estuvi ramos m s centrados podr amos haber hecho m s cosas
4025034 nos queda jugar con jap n y bulgaria y aunque sabemos que lo tenemos muy complicado tenemos que intentarlo hasta el final cuando nos ponemos esta camiseta jugamos por nosotros nuestras familias y por 26 millones de venezolanos no podemos defraudarles
4025035 la derrota ante china nos ha hecho da o sobre todo porque pod amos haber ganado nos falta saber cerrar los partidos esos peque os detalles que sirven para ganar y el que haya desconfianzas en el equipo no ayuda nada
4025036 no es un problema del bocog que no se haya autorizado ninguna manifestaci n de protesta creo que china est dando pasos hacia adelante no hay que subestimar la sabidur a del pueblo chino si ustedes vienen aqu y quieren criticar perfecto pero hagan caso a la mayor a del pueblo chino si no ser n inducidos a error
4025037 yo siento que la apertura de estos tres recintos est basada en la constituci n china para permitir al pueblo manifestarse pero hay que solicitar permiso es un buen dato de que nos estamos abriendo hemos pedido los datos y cuando nos los faciliten se los daremos a conocer
4025038 el coi siente verg enza porque china no est cumpliendo sus promesas
4025039 han progresado el trabajo se est viendo y despu s se podr evaluar c mo estos juegos han tenido una influencia en china nos enorgullece que los juegos evolucionen y funcionen a la perfecci n y nos complace que la organizaci n lo ha hecho todo bien la competencia del coi es conseguir que se cumplan los valores ol mpicos
4025040 los periodistas deben poder cumplir con su trabajo no veo que haya que atacarlos si est n cumpliendo su labor
4025041 gozamos del mayor bienestar la condici n econ mica ha mejorado china es un pa s muy distinto y los juegos son un gran momento para constatarlo la gente es optimista hacia el futuro pero hay quien no est contento
4025042 me parece que unos cuantos vienen para criticar pero esto no significa que china no haya cumplido sus promesas los juegos iban a abrir horizontes aqu van a ver mejor lo que es china
4025043 no alentamos preguntas sobre el conflicto porque suscitar an un debate contrario al olimpismo
4025044 johan is more of a link up man than nic he is good in the air and has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
4025045 we are not putting pressure on him to come in and take over from nic we are putting pressure on him to go out there and do what he does best
4025046 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4025047 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4025048 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4025049 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4025050 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows
4025051 der wahre tummelplatz f r betr gereien sind die unbekannten dinge da erstens alles unbekannte f r glaubw rdig gehalten wird und zweitens die tatsache da sie nicht unseren gewohnten vernunftschl ssen unterworfen sind uns der mittel beraubt die betr ger zu widerlegen

4025063 ya camin ya s como es el circuito conozco las condiciones y s cuando reservarme y cuando atacar
4025064 es dif cil jugar cuando en el equipo hay una mala relaci n con personas que nos est n dirigiendo si el conductor de un veh culo est despistado ser dif cil que pueda llegar a su destino sin ning n percance
4025065 contra estados unidos hizo falta un cambio t cnico para haber ganado pero nunca lleg
4025066 hay desconfianza hacia gente que nos est dirigiendo y as es imposible centrarse y hacer nada
4025067 en cuanto acaben los juegos me voy a mi casa la relaci n con los jugadores y con los dirigentes es muy dif cil y faltan muchos medios para poder hacer un trabajo en condiciones a unos juegos ol mpicos no se puede venir con estos problemas
4025068 son gente dif cil no se puede vivir all en venezuela hay demasiados problemas de todo tipo deportivos y no deportivos
4025069 non stata una finale facile ma negli ultimi giorni stavo sparando bene e avevo fiducia mi sono preparata bene a singapore qui il campo di gara era ancora pi difficile dedico questo oro alla mia famiglia e a mio marito e non finisce qui ho solo 30 anni e voglio vincere ancora
4025070 morsi al sedere e brad pitt vi parlo della mia amica fede
4025071 prima della sua partenza non si parlava mai di pechino fede superstiziosa odia gli in bocca al lupo quando ci siamo salutate le ho detto solo vai non lho chiamata e non le ho spedito sms dopo la delusione dei 400 so che deve scaricare la rabbia da sola per i 200 ho puntato la sveglia mi sono alzata alle 4 ho seguito la gara in silenzio allultima vasca ho urlato vai fede spaccale tutte e alla fine ho mollato un urlo che ho tirato gi il palazzo si sono accese delle finestre
4025072 asilo elementari medie insieme io la chiamo fede lei mi chiama carlo in vacanza a jesolo voleva giocare a rincorrerci in acqua ma spariva e in un amen riaffiorava in mezzo al mare come si fa allinizio eravamo cane e gatto come a quel mio compleanno che mi ha tirato un morsicone sul sedere e mi sono infuriata adesso fede sa che se ha bisogno di confidarsi trova una tomba la prima volta che mi ha parlato di luca faceva la disinvolta ma gli occhi parlavano da soli senti fede le ho detto raccontamela giusta stavolta la cosa seria ha sorriso beata credo proprio di s non lho mai sentita parlare male della manaudou giuro
4025073 io fede e isabella siamo il nucleo storico della compagnia fede ha in casa la nostra foto stampata sulla pancia di un leoncino di peluche adora i peluche il ritrovo era al parco nuove gemme come balla fede normale diciamo che pu fare meglio ma non andiamo pi in discoteca torna cos poche volte a casa che abbiamo troppo da dirci per questo non andiamo al cine brad pitt il suo preferito meglio la pizzeria del cinema lei ordina il solito calzone e si chiacchiera e poi shopping selvaggio a venezia e mestre le scarpe col tacco alto se le comprerebbe tutte anche biancheria intima ma soprattutto scarpe col tacco ricordo uno paio nere decollet splendide fede ha gusto un mago ad abbinare gli accessori al vestito pi jeans che gonne ci mette una vita a prepararsi prima di uscire
4025074 fede come guida divertente e sportiva al cambio della cinquecento ha messo uno di quei braccialetti di santini che si consumano e lultimo che resta quello che ti protegge era impallinata coi metallica ora allautoradio spara house music e disco quando torna ci faremo lo stesso tatuaggio gi deciso per me sar il primo fede ne ha cinque sul piede la scritta bal il soprannome di luca laraba fenice la scritta nientaltro che noi come suo fratello e un tribale sul fondoschiena un drago sul polpaccio lei piercing al capezzolo io allorecchio fede mi manca ci vediamo poco una ragazza di grande umanit pu parlarne male solo chi non la conosce ha sofferto per certe cose dette sulle sue vicende ha risposto in vasca e ora si merita la felicit quando torna a spinea mi dice vieni con me in piscina lei si allena io resto a bagnomaria cos stiamo insieme vorrei tornasse pi spesso
4025075 ha sido una pelea muy importante para m en el debut ol mpico y ahora estoy listo para seguir en la lucha por la medalla
4025076 nunca estuve en peligro de perder la pelea todo fue estrategia en el segundo asalto
4025077 estoy listo para el gran reto de la medalla ha llegado el momento de mi vida de demostrar que puedo ser campe n ol mpico
4025078 se pensaba que se pod a haber conseguido en judo pero no se dio y ahora tendremos otras oportunidades para lograr la primera medalla de oro sin que tenga que haber presi n para nadie
4025079 the people of this state are now of a very firm view that theres something very smelly about the way the government have conducted themselves
4025080 the only way well ever get the truth out of this is through a royal commission
4025081 this is the body who the state governments agency doir have contracted to be in charge of the safety regime where the explosion occurred
4025082 how can anybody have confidence that that is an independent inquiry
4025083 there is absolutely no way that i am trying to or will be involved in any process to cover anything up

4025159 durlach hat das gespielt was wir h ufig in der bundesliga praktizieren hinten stand der asv kompakt und ber konter wurde nadelstichartig nach vorne gespielt durlach ist ber sich hinausgewachsen wir hingegen konnten den schalter nicht mehr umlegen insgesamt gesehen darf man unseren auftritt nicht sch n reden das war ein schlechtes spiel von uns
4025160 nicht ein spieler war nach dem spiel zufrieden der einzug in die n chste runde steht aber dennoch ber allem
4025161 eine schwierige auftakth rde das wichtigste ist dass wir uns als einheit pr sentieren wir m ssen unsere heimspiele positiv gestalten die werderaner wissen auch noch nicht genau wo sie stehen aber klar ist dass bremen eine der spielst rksten mannschaft der gesamten liga ist
4025162 dass die startelf aus dem durlach spiel nicht gewaltig ver ndern wird
4025163 alle mannschaften fangen bei null an wissen nicht wo sie stehen auch bremen nicht wir haben zwar in durlach alles andere als gut gespielt meine mannschaft wird aber gegen bremen eine ganz andere leistung abrufen diesmal m ssen nicht wir sondern wird sicherlich bremen versuchen das spiel zu machen fu ballerisch bietet bremen das beste der liga auf diego ist ganz klar einer besten spieler der liga bremen wird ihn auch gegen uns vermissen aber ein spieler alleine macht keine gute mannschaft aus
4025164 hoffentlich war der auftritt in durlach ein schuss vorn bug zur rechten zeit das was der dsc da gespielt hat war wirklich schlecht die arminia kann von gl ck reden dass sie weitergekommen ist ich mache mir wirklich sorgen hoffe aber darauf dass bielefeld zum saisonstart zumindest einen punkt gegen bremen holt werder wird das spiel machen der dsc sollte versuchen aus einer gefestigten abwehr heraus zu agieren von katongo verspreche ich mir einiges er ist wirklich ein sehr guter spieler

4025396 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001
4025397 any slowdown in the japanese economy is likely to be relatively modest
4025398 longs is the type of store in summer thats going to carry 50 different types of sun hats and have a garden department i would go to longs to buy gifts because they had a lot of neat stuff
4025399 we love this company but we believe to continue to provide the service and care our customers expect from longs and continue to provide great career opportunities for our people and earn our shareholder return this was the best course of action
4025400 it was necessary to merge with a national player because increasingly we compete with national players
4025401 we really worked hard to join with a company that has the same commitment to the community and its employees that longs has
4025402 as the market gets more dominated by cvs and caremark the independent pharmacies are really on the outside looking in with no leverage whatsoever

4025405 we really didnt get any data that made us feel any better about the financials
4025406 as oil prices come off people just feel a bit better about the outlook for economic growth and its positive for consumer confidence
4025407 we still do think the external environment has become less favorable and exports in a lot of the asian economies are feeling the pressure
4025408 none are conventional mls vendors we think what we can build is something based on technology used by sites like trulia zillow google

4025411 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4025412 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4025413 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4025414 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4025415 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different

4025443 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4025444 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4025445 the era of repression is over forever has become a tale of the past
4025446 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it
4025447 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4025448 the exciting question is now whether there will be stabilization in the third quarter
4025449 we expect a stabilization also because oil prices have significantly fallen and the euro has become weaker that should help but in the coming quarters we will only see weak growth
4025450 the economic development in the second quarter was marked by declining consumption by private households and diminished plant investment
4025451 construction investment was in particular significantly lower than in the first quarter
4025452 foreign trade was a positive contributor which can above all be attributed to a significant fall in imports
4025453 we have had an excellent quarter but expect to see a flattening dynamism in the coming quarters
4025454 this reassessment and modification of the earnings target are the result of a changed overall economic situation and more particularly of the earnings weakness in the department store business in germany

4025466 if you are a good football player you are a good football player whether its in the champions league or in another game
4025467 that means when you have the ball you make an intelligent decision if you play against your friends on the beach or in a big game its exactly the same if you are a good player you are a good player
4025468 aaron has the ingredients to become a good player he has a fantastic engine he has a good build and good technique although i do feel he has to improve that
4025469 he has good vision too but he has to improve the defensive part of his game and his positioning on the pitch
4025470 it is like being a good student and being in a good class or an average class
4025471 your progress is always quicker in a good class half the development of a player is to down to having the luck to be involved as quickly as possible at a top club
4025472 in england we have always to calm things down because after one month of games there is always the media pressure to make quick stars
4025473 these players are young patient development does not mean you cannot start early but it is most important to keep developing as a player and you should not have to worry about too much pressure on your shoulders
4025474 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment

4025488 radio ternyata kita sama menjadi corong belaka dari kepentingan yang lebih besar dari kita dan tak pernah benar benar kita pahami keberadaannya ternyata kita hanya sebuah alat kepanjangan tangan orang orang yang bahkan tak kita kenal siapa dia
4025489 aku tak lagi mengagumimu dengan sangat tapi percayalah aku akan tetap berteman denganmu karena setidaknya kita senasib kau membangkitkan kesadaran bahwa aku harus berbeda denganmu bahwa menjadi corong kepanjangan tangan orang lain bukanlah suatu kesalahan selama nurani kita tetap mengkritisinya

4025505 most athletes have the worst diet in the world and they compete in spite of it
4025506 if care is taken to include a wide variety of foods vegetarian diets can be nutritionally adequate to support athletic performance
4025507 whether an individual is a recreational or world class athlete being a vegetarian does not diminish natural talent or athletic performance as far back as the ancient games greek athletes trained on vegetarian diets and displayed amazing ability in competitive athletics

4025519 right now we are still in the middle of a crisis so i dont know what we are going to do
4025520 i want to make sure were getting a good deal
4025521 were getting closer to consensus among all kinds of folks from labor to council
4025522 we just seem to be getting on the same page which is great
4025523 we made it a little harder for the development proposal to get an obligatory blessing

4025526 i never really was sick before this i had no lights and no tv or anything
4025527 i felt like i was in a movie when everything was destroyed and gone
4025528 surprisingly there wasnt that many people driving either so it seemed deserted
4025529 we just drove to the olive garden in meridian township and found that they were open but there were so many people
4025530 with the caveat that these systems are mechanical and mechanical systems fail
4025531 we are much better situated than we were five years ago
4025532 were much more aware of what is happening in our region
4025533 and much better able to address a huge spike in energy demand and not create a huge blackout
4025534 i was worried at first something happened like terrorist wise but then i realized nothing bad happened and it was just human error

4025543 i think it would be a real tragedy if he didnt play here as long as he possibly could
4025544 id love darren to keep playing for the broncos in 2010 2011 and then maybe get on the coaching staff
4025545 im sure hed be a good coach i think he is thinking along those lines and i think that is what he wants to do
4025546 it would be a wonderful thing for him to move into that role especially at this club
4025547 darren is very honest bloke hes very team oriented and he cares a lot about this place
4025548 sam thaiday is off contract greg eastwoods off contract and dave taylor is off contract
4025549 i dont know whats going to happen with those guys and what kind of money will get freed up
4025550 theres still a lot of things to be played out before now and then
4025551 and if you look at the sonny bill thing players can get an offer and come and ask for a release
4025552 that might happen so yes theres a possibility we can keep both of them but well have to wait until april or may next year to find out
4025553 this time last year you couldnt keep a lid on it at all
4025554 the town was in a frenzy that anxiety anticipation and the nerves of going into another finals series
4025555 are they going to lose again all those sorts of things
4025556 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4025557 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4025558 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4025559 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4025560 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due
4025561 this year and in footy in general there doesnt seem to be those one on one matchups there used to be in the past
4025562 its very much a rotation thing and goodesy is certainly one of those players who could be rotated through because hes a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on him
4025563 it was one of the most memorable games ive ever played in
4025564 one thing about greg inglis is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4025565 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4025566 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats with rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too

4025578 theres nothing not to like about sewickley its always in perfect condition and its a good hard golf course thats really fun to play
4025579 weve had callaway golf as a sponsor for two years and they increased their contribution as did our members
4025580 one member in particular joel adams of adams capital management gave quite a bit all the contributions have really helped this event grow
4025581 last year we had a three inch rain the night before the first round
4025582 we had to get the bunkers flushed out and the greens crew was unable to mow anything
4025583 this year was great and ive probably never seen our golf course in better shape than it was for the first round
4025584 we were the first group to start on one and the guys who were even par in round 1 teed off right behind us
4025585 its always nice to be in one of the lead groups but it really doesnt affect anything you just have to get ready when its time to get ready
4025586 its fun but you really have to think your way around on sewickley
4025587 you cant just hit it at pins you have to hit away from pins use off speed shots so it doesnt spin off the green things like that
4025588 we had around 25 or 26 amateurs playing this year and some of our members were able to play
4025589 we even had three of our full time caddies play and one of those made the cut its just about trying to get more interest from all different avenues

4025596 thats going to be the biggest factor two years down the track does he become a 2ic to someone who is maybe a better name or younger after he does all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over
4025597 hes an outstanding young bloke and i sincerely hope that he has the chance to coach an afl side
4025598 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations

4025601 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france
4025602 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
4025603 i knew that question was coming eventually but not so soon
4025604 a little song a little dance batmans head on a lance
4025605 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4025606 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
4025607 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
4025608 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number
4025609 for individuals who have chronic issues this is a very unhealthy issue click to enlarge gregg miller staff photographer serious problem

4025614 beating lyme understanding and treating this complex and often misdiagnosed disease
4025615 i bless bean for uncovering these issues and i beg the medical profession to start looking at these diseases more closely
4025616 why do we not care that our kids are on tetracyclines for years for acne
4025617 patients who trade off getting better with long term antibiotics and staying disabled do not think twice
4025618 ive reached the point where i dont foresee me getting completely well but i can live with the way i am right now
4025619 i read so many books that when i finished with them i didnt know which direction to take
4025620 this book is to help people validate their problem so they can take it to their doctor
4025621 my background was in public health and i didnt know why my antibiotic was limited to two weeks
4025622 if i had been remotely exposed to anthrax in a heartbeat i would have been given this same drug long term
4025623 if the disease has become chronic the bacterial spirochetes may no longer be in the bloodstream
4025624 they may have traveled to the brain and other body tissues where they more easily evade the immune system and antibiotics
4025625 he manages to prevail over the doctors who are willing to treat long term
4025626 they have shown the changes and improvements that occur with continued treatment that would not occur if spirochetes had been eradicated after a few weeks of treatment
4025627 document patient improvement with longer term treatment and better outcomes with longer treatment showing continued presence of lyme spirochetes
4025628 we lost a lot of people both number wise and talent wise but we also kept a big core coming back
4025629 because we mix it up a bit you could say we have six to eight starters coming back its like any other time you lose some but you get some new players in
4025630 bobbys an integral part but we do have a number of very good players coming back
4025631 he just has to do his normal part he doesnt have to do any more or any less
4025632 i like having the competition weve always had good goalkeepers and i intend for that tradition to continue
4025633 its going to be more challenging this year but i think some girls are really going to step up its open competition for lineup spots and while i dont expect too many surprises its easy to pass someone up in this sport
4025634 i think noella is one of the best players in the wpial but i think its going to be more of a multi dimentional team without sarah and cate at the front of the lineup
4025635 trey for instance was critical in our victory over upper st clair last season
4025636 he and alex werent far off our top six last year
4025637 the jv program gives the guys lots of experience and makes a great feeder program for us because they have to play triple a and quad a teams that means when we pull them in they already know how to handle the pressure
4025638 weve been strong in wpials in a lot of years but at states the boys have been third fourth and fifth
4025639 this year we have four frontrunners that could earn individual medals where in the past its only been one or two only one wpial team has won the piaa title and i think with this team we can show up and make a statement for the west

4025643 end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
4025644 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed
4025645 the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses
4025646 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt
4025647 this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief and we are determined to catch whoever was responsible
4025648 it is a state and federal requirement that we follow these procedures
4025649 we have no assurance from the state or anyone else that that is being done in a bipartisan manner anywhere else in the state

4025666 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4025667 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4025668 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4025669 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4025670 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4025671 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4025672 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4025673 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4025674 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4025675 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4025676 last year was actually our first in the do the right thing program
4025677 but if we realized the effect that it would have on our staff and kids we would have joined it sooner
4025678 students are recognized throughout the year during monthly programs then for the last three years a school of the year and a student of the year have been recognized
4025679 its amazing that she was able to keep her head and get her family out of the house under those circumstances
4025680 its a good tool to promote positive behavior and improve morale to reward kids for good deeds
4025681 they could be nominated for anything from picking up a piece of trash on the playground to helping someone who is hurt to the nurses office
4025682 there is no hard and fast formula for determining that

4025696 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4025697 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4025698 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4025699 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4025934 the town was in a frenzy that anxiety anticipation and the nerves of going into another finals series
4025935 are they going to lose again all those sorts of things
4025936 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4025937 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4025938 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4025939 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4025940 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due
4025941 this year and in footy in general there doesnt seem to be those one on one matchups there used to be in the past
4025942 its very much a rotation thing and goodesy is certainly one of those players who could be rotated through because hes a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on him
4025943 it was one of the most memorable games ive ever played in
4025944 one thing about greg inglis is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4025945 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4025946 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats with rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too
4025947 i think it would be a real tragedy if he didnt play here as long as he possibly could
4025948 id love darren to keep playing for the broncos in 2010 2011 and then maybe get on the coaching staff
4025949 im sure hed be a good coach i think he is thinking along those lines and i think that is what he wants to do
4025950 it would be a wonderful thing for him to move into that role especially at this club
4025951 darren is very honest bloke hes very team oriented and he cares a lot about this place
4025952 sam thaiday is off contract greg eastwoods off contract and dave taylor is off contract
4025953 i dont know whats going to happen with those guys and what kind of money will get freed up
4025954 theres still a lot of things to be played out before now and then
4025955 and if you look at the sonny bill thing players can get an offer and come and ask for a release
4025956 that might happen so yes theres a possibility we can keep both of them but well have to wait until april or may next year to find out
4025957 so wie die da vorne schwimmen kann ich nicht mehr mithalten

4025976 the closer you look the harder it is to generalize about sovereign funds

4025979 bunele relatii dintre rusia si statele unite sunt de domeniul trecutului
4025980 moscova a anuntat revenirea fara apel la o realitate nostalgica de care toata lumea va trebui sa tina cont rusia este la fel de importanta pe scena internationala ca onu sau nato si este autosuficienta pentru a impune dreptatea asa cum a facut o occidentul in kosovo
4025981 vesticii au considerat ca totul le este permis iar ceilalti nu au niciun drept rusia a demonstrat definitiv prin actele sale ca nu are intentia sa joace dupa aceste reguli
4025982 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4025983 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4025984 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4025985 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4025986 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4025987 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4025988 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4025989 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4025990 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4025991 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4025992 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4025993 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4025994 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4025995 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4025996 fraggle rock season 4 will be releases on october 28 2008
4025997 and even as late as a july 27th presentation at comic con internation henson company representatives including red fraggle herself stated that the fourth season was planned for release later this year

4026014 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4026015 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4026016 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4026017 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4026018 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4026019 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4026020 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4026021 relative wages in those industries are rising relative to others and that helps the labour resources flow mr stevens told a parliamentary committee at the time
4026022 that is what is supposed to happen in a shock of this nature
4026023 while it is not without a few bumps on the road this adjustment is not proceeding too badly he said
4026024 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4026025 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4026026 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4026027 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot

4026029 it looks like i will be able to make the next game without needing to get a job that would interfere with that
4026030 i dont have official sales numbers for the full week but i would guess about 55 000 people have bought the game so far
4026031 sales are now slower than they were on launch day but not too much the sales didnt just die after the first few days as they do with some games
4026032 as a result it looks like i will be able to make the next game without needing to get a job that would interfere with that the estimated sales so far of 55 000 are not enough for this but extrapolating into the future the situation looks safe
4026033 the wave of highly positive reviews took me by surprise but the unexpectedly good sales show that this isnt just a game for critics a lot of people out there are playing braid and getting good things from it

4026064 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million

4026117 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4026118 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies

4026130 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other

4026136 there is no doubt in our mind that he knew we were coming to get him
4026137 unfortunately mr fontanez decided not to go peacefully and it turned violent
4026138 my kid was a good kid they didnt have to kill him
4026139 they had him down so whyd they have to shoot him i dont understand
4026140 it makes no sense they could have waited for arraignment to set bail or take him into custody
4026141 all i can say is there was a valid arrest warrant and we made the decision to pick him up
4026142 i cant tell you exactly how that determination was made
4026143 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

4026148 some places offer savings above and beyond the tax holiday
4026149 stores are doing more than ever to attract customers so start looking around
4026150 check the ads check online they want business so even if something is over the 2 500 limit some stores might give you the 5 percent off anyway
4026151 look around for long term free financing and other deals and you can double up on savings
4026152 with promotional deals coupled with the holiday you can save a lot on the stuff you really need
4026153 make a list check out the circulars and start out early
4026154 you can save time and make sure you get the best deal
4026155 honey that sink is dreadful you just go in there and take care of it right now
4026156 fees are not the only issue as part of the strategy we will also be looking at the australian system of student loans and in fact maybe we would look at the private sector itself in terms of funding courses
4026157 perhaps colleges could look at themselves as part business as well as being part educational and perhaps they can derive much more money from the private sector in terms of endowments for some courses and in terms of scholarship for some of their students
4026158 in terms of value for money i want to look at the whole lecturing profile i want to make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to the students are actually in the classroom from time to time
4026159 every hour that academics spend on administration and seeking external research funding is an hour lost to teaching students the core funding of universities is only rising 2 5 this year but it should be going up at least 6 if were to provide the same services as last year
4026160 i expected in the early days of the debate to have the usual opposition cries with no forethought and no rational arguments in terms of what we should plan ahead for
4026161 im looking at a society now where there are no fees a society where there are extremely high earners who are not contributing to students entering third level im asking those people to play a part and i will be putting these sentiments to government
4026162 the taxpayer is contributing 332 million by way of tuition fees to third level and it behoves me to look at exactly how were going to move forward and fund it
4026163 there has been a major improvement in the number of people in third level from the less well off sectors of society but im obviously not satisfied with that i see the introduction of some form of fees in the future as helping me ensure a greater support service is available in those communities
4026164 they will have a negative impact on the range and number of programmes available and were particularly concerned that they will have a disproportionate impact on undergraduate students particularly the disadvantaged students who must be educated to the highest standards to drive change in our rapidly evolving open economy
4026165 most of those who got their results will now be awaiting cao offers with some anxiety
4026166 unfortunately this year the concerns of students and their families will be increased by the governments threat to reintroduce third level fees
4026167 the best contribution he could make to ensuring that these students fulfil their full educational potential is to drop this crazy plan

4026192 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters

4026196 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
4026197 the fact that byron kept the letters is important he was absolutely fascinated by his own reception and the way he was perceived he even mingled his poetry with his own self creation he pretended not to care about his reader while at the same time making huge efforts to keep track of what his readers thought about him
4026198 my lord tho i have not the honor of being personally known to you i yet venture to address you tho i cannot offer any other excuse for the liberty i take if the irresistible desire i feel of thus unknown paying my humble tribute at the shrine of genius be not deemd any apology i have hung in rapt attention over every line of child harold i am not a critic but an inexperienced young woman but the language of genius amp of nature must be felt amp never makes its appeal in vain to my heart

4026210 they were here to do business not to attack the olympics
4026211 the worlds opinion was increasingly becoming skeptical about organized terrorism so the government is trying to prove that it is a real threat
4026212 my feeling is that the vast majority of uighurs are very ardently opposed to disrupting the olympics
4026213 some said they want the olympics to go well so china will loosen its control over uighurs in xinjiang
4026214 there are some words we feel in our hearts but we cannot say
4026215 terrorism should not be linked with particular ethnic or religious groups
4026216 these terrorists cannot represent the vast majority of the uighur people

4026246 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4026247 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4026248 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops

4026385 certainly for a long time there has been this thing oh it doesnt happen bicyclists dont have this problem
4026386 it looks different and when you first get on the bike you have to balance differently but its not a difficult adjustment
4026387 noseless saddles take the pressure off the groin area theyre much more comfortable to use
4026388 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
4026389 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
4026390 wed start shooting at nine or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
4026391 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
4026392 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
4026393 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
4026394 this is supposed to be the informal part of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
4026395 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way
4026396 my big a list gig ended in d list style
4026397 i want you to be you i just dont want to know about it

4026403 it gave us a chance to sort of spend the week sort of officially welcoming cbc aboard
4026404 we made a daily mention of it and did some canadian fun facts because im sure you know a lot of americans are not necessarily well versed in what goes on north of their border we had fun with that
4026405 theres a lot of sort of making fun of people and putting them in embarrassing situations
4026406 i think one of the attractions of our show is its pretty benign on that level i think we treat our players with respect we have fun and we laugh and all that but were not putting them there to make fun of them well have fun with them and i think people recognize that
4026407 since im in the game show world i figure i may as well exploit it as much as possible
4026408 its the biggest game show in taiwan its called blackjack bowling and its very funny

4026428 i had a little i guess you could call it a sleepover with someone i had known for a while
4026429 wed always had girlfriends or boyfriends and then we both came to the games single and after our events were over it was kind of like oh were both single it just sort of happened
4026430 you get a lot of people who are in shape and you know testosterones up and everybodys attracted to everybody
4026431 everybodys fit beyond belief and were all definitely red blooded humans that want to meet each other
4026432 we were walking through the athletes village and the italian girls came over to me and said so and so sent you an e mail and shes over there and she really wants to meet you
4026433 i know a lot of couples where one flies home to canada one flies home to italy the next day
4026434 its kind of like going to las vegas what happens there stays there
4026435 i found it very professional i think people like to think of it as a big party an orgy or whatever
4026436 but theyre not really experienced partiers people who have dedicated their whole lives to running they have a couple drinks and they get a little bit crazy
4026437 they put you in university style dorms and theres usually two single beds in the room so that was kind of weird because were used to sleeping together
4026438 i know that sounds kind of silly because youre in the same room but just to reach over and hold his hand or touch him and make sure hes there i needed that
4026439 its not really something youre thinking about whether youre with your husband or not
4026440 it was something along the lines of i awoke to a rustling under the cover at 6 52 and then there was a quote of max saying i know she couldnt work too hard because she had to conserve her energy
4026441 and max said in german this was his quote and the only quote we gave from those olympic games regarding us being together if she wins you can write whatever you want
4026442 i never gave a quote i would never give a quote
4026443 since 92 the men remember that im the girl who did it and the women remember that my husband cried on cbc
4026444 if i was a hollywood star i would have sued or something
4026445 the iceberg is the yet to be released forensic report which should be leading to prosecutions the da believes that the time is long past for the report to be released and will be calling for this once again in the joint agriculture and scopa standing committee on public accounts meeting to be held next week in the legislature the anc must support this
4026446 the turnaround strategy mthimkhulu promised for the beleaguered department when he became its political head has so far amounted to nothing more than a series of cosmetic alterations hence the calls for his sacking from the departments employees
4026447 unless we can assess the extent of the deluge left in one of the provinces most important departments no remedial action of substance and benefit to the people of kwazulu natal can take place
4026448 this news follows closely on the heels of the transformation of the department as a result of many irregularities that were uncovered during the forensic investigation of the department
4026449 until we get a communique to that effect we will not respond to media reports because they may be a distortion of what happened
4026450 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress
4026451 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
4026452 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
4026453 but we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs residential mortgage backed securities markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel
4026454 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
4026455 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things
4026456 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
4026457 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
4026458 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility
4026459 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
4026460 the appellants as indonesian citizens have constitutional rights which are not to be tortured
4026461 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4026462 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4026463 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4026464 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot
4026465 es dif cil jugar cuando en el equipo hay una mala relaci n con personas que nos est n dirigiendo si el conductor de un veh culo est despistado ser dif cil que pueda llegar a su destino sin ning n percance

4026468 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4026469 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4026470 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4026471 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4026472 the key thing about this is that the process will be fully automated so there is no requirement for a skilled person to use the technology
4026473 theres nothing to say that a veterinary lab assistant couldnt go out and swab birds and run the test at present tests have to be sent to a lab where you need fully trained personnel and thats where the hold up occurs
4026474 i have always focused on a period of four years and to go any faster it would be impossible
4026475 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4026476 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4026477 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4026478 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4026479 the points didnt go for me in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4026480 i felt my performance was exceptional but ive had better days i felt i should have had six or seven points for my body shots but theyre not scoring body shots you might as well do fencing not boxing if theyre going to do that
4026481 i didnt really think about what time i needed but to go quicker than yesterday is good and its only a fraction off my best time
4026482 i have a whole day to rest now i didnt get that much sleep last night i keep thinking about random things i had a dream last night i was getting done for murder hopefully it wont come true
4026483 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4026484 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4026485 essentially it is the wests worst nightmare that this is squaring up into some kind of proxy confrontation between america and russia
4026486 russias foreign minister said america now has to choose between georgia and russia so the situation is getting more and more serious and critically russia is saying quite clearly that it believes the solution the way forward must not involve america

4026491 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4026492 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4026493 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4026494 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4026495 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4026496 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4026497 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4026498 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4026499 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4026500 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4026501 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4026502 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes
4026503 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4026504 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers

4026507 relative wages in those industries are rising relative to others and that helps the labour resources flow mr stevens told a parliamentary committee at the time
4026508 that is what is supposed to happen in a shock of this nature
4026509 while it is not without a few bumps on the road this adjustment is not proceeding too badly he said
4026510 we have seen a trend in several of our top hotel markets of more guests at hotels being locals or from nearby areas
4026511 houston for example has seen some of the most significant increases in this category
4026512 we do know the word on the street is that its happening
4026513 people join for getting towed but stay for the extra benefits
4026514 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
4026515 at that time a lot of people may have decided to stay in the area because of fuel prices
4026516 the no 1 reason people visit the houston area is to see friends and family
4026517 weve seen an increase this summer in just our regional destination draw
4026518 but we figured we werent not going to go on vacation so we went to the woodlands
4026519 we went to florida only because we had a 60 resort stay for the week
4026520 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
4026521 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day

4026523 i will be putting pen to paper at some point yes
4026524 they will be an attempt to put in a longer term historical perspective the events of more than 33 years of public life
4026525 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally
4026526 in the end all of us in public life will be judged by history and im no different from anybody else
4026527 you havent changed nice to see you all i wouldnt want you to change you were so loveable in your old form

4026539 on august 11 i inspected the premises on high road leytonstone
4026540 i was accompanied by my colleague mrs pip broad and we carried out an inspection in which we found a number of items including out of date and mouldy food and rancid chicken
4026541 these problems demonstrate a real lack of training and food hygiene awareness
4026542 this skydive was the most amazing experience i have ever had and it was for such a worthwhile local cause isabel hospice
4026543 freefalling the first mile in 30 seconds and i was off to a mind numbing start my instructor constantly reminded me that i need to make him look good on the dvd so i can honestly say i smiled all the way down
4026544 once the main parachute opened it was more leisurely taking about three and a half minutes with the opportunity to look around the scenery the next most scary thing was the landing and happily this was uneventful and on target time to breathe again and watch my buddies fall from the sky after me
4026545 if current trends continue we are likely to see the pass rate nudge over 97 per cent this year
4026546 in terms of a grades in 2002 it was 20 7 per cent and in 2007 it was 25 3 per cent
4026547 that means it has risen by just short of 5 per cent in six years should that continue it will mean more than 26 per cent will get a grades this year
4026548 starting out in pastry shaped a lot of my expectations of food the pastry chef has one chance at the end of the meal to make the impression that the guest carries with them
4026549 we bring that approach to each of our biteswe eat with our eyes first and then the taste leaves the lasting impression each of our bites may be small but we expect each to wow a guest with both its look and its flavors
4026550 everyone loved the idea of nibbling tasty morsels all evening long and not having to break up their conversations to sit down to a formal dinner it made for a very congenial and friendly evening for 75 people who were just getting to know one another each lovely item was delicious inventive and strikingly crafted the milkshakes that ended the evening were a triumph
4026551 our ultimate plan is to create the largest network of relevant web sites for african americans
4026552 we already have the best online properties and the best web architects so many companies have launched different initiatives targeting african americans online and have failed were going to show everybody the right way to do this
4026553 our affiliates showed an increase of about 12 percentage points over last year
4026554 we also beleive that it is a sign that the economy may not be as bad as we have bleeived over the past several months
4026555 yes i would buy one for work as a teacher i would probably buy the necklace with the school bus
4026556 i know many people who would love to receive boojeebeads lanyards as a gift i think they are ideal as office gifts i would probably give one like the multi stone pearl id necklace it is lovely
4026557 i work in a high school and my daughter goes to the same one
4026558 yes id buy the green one for my sister in law who is a nurse
4026559 besides myself i have several friends and coworkers that this would be a great gift for
4026560 a childs first year in school is a unique time for working moms
4026561 this is a new horizon for kids and another level of commitment and nurturing for working moms and dads because we want to provide all the support we can and still meet the demands of the workplace i vowed that i would share my kindergarten journey with other parents and here it is
4026562 should i home school private school stay at home work part time flex time or no time
4026563 the one thing that i want working moms to take away from corporate to kindergarten is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel even when hard choices and sacrifices have to be made along the way thats what i learned during our kindergarten year in school

4026590 if you buy real estate at the right price it doesnt matter when you buy the fundamental rule of any investment including real estate is to buy low and sell high we are just on the front end of all these foreclosures happening
4026591 im very happy that i did well in my very first tournament at titan poker the tournament went smoothly and was a lot of fun from the very start i managed to play well next time ill try for first place
4026592 they came here i think probably ill prepared by the their own government and left it up to us to do all the basic training
4026593 kiribati people are their own failures they werent motivated i couldnt get them to work
4026594 the media continues to hammer the message of planning for your financial retirement when there are so many non financial issues to be considered including at what age do you retire do you continue working do you relocate consider wellness issues etc
4026595 it is very concerning and there are a number of issues
4026596 i have been advocating for many years that the government needs to look at the issue of legalising drugs
4026597 that doesnt mean someone could walk into a shop and ask for a half pound of heroin it would be registered drug addicts
4026598 if a person has an addiction well deal with it and help them but getting clean drugs on prescription is a help methadone is not the only answer weve got to look at the big picture
4026599 if they are registered addicts and they are using clean drugs of the same strength and quality each time in a clean safe environment rather than a drug den and they are making regular contract with people who can help them come off drugs then it can only help them
4026600 clearly there has not been very effective education in the past at the present and possibly in the future
4026601 it needs to be made available to people of all ages in primary school secondary school and also post school
4026602 there is a lot of pain and agony connected to drug addiction families never forget it
4026603 if we educate the next generation and those people dont become drug users well help prevent that
4026604 there is a lot of pain and agony connected to drug addiction families never forget it if we educate the next generation then these people may not become drug users

4026806 were all glad to get it back and we appreciate what the rcmp did to get it back and the man who dropped it off
4026807 my guess is whoever did take it would have heard it on the news somehow and then they put it there hoping someone would see it and pick it up
4026808 i think its very nice of them to do that really
4026809 mr leblanc given these circumstances knew what was going on and did it to gain a financial profit
4026810 he took advantage of an opportunity he should have let pass
4026811 the area of origin is pretty well nailed down to the rear of the building the southeast corner of the building
4026812 however the cause of the fire is yet to be determined right now i cant hang my hat on anything to tell you the honest truth
4026813 its just to be 100 per cent sure of what happened here
4026814 anything electrical that they can get their hands on panel boxes switch boxes light fixtures anything like that but you have to understand theres a lot of destruction in that building as well
4026815 it may have been a fan it may have been a blower it may have been a heating device that automatically cut in
4026816 were dealing with a lot of flammable and combustible liquids in the building so anything is possible
4026817 but the employees are very well versed in mixing those chemicals and how to use them in the proper way
4026818 theyre not going to put one chemical into another where youre going to get an explosion thats going to blow up in their face and there goes their livelihood
4026819 somebody having a smoke in a place where they werent supposed to smoke
4026820 it could be maybe an oily rag put in the wrong location
4026821 we have streets that are falling apart bridges that need repair and water and sewer that is slowly getting out of date
4026822 the water projects are important but no different than any of the other infrastructure projects
4026823 that will basically allow us to keep our heads above water
4026824 but it isnt going to allow us to get down to the root of the problem
4026825 with a lot of these water projects youre replacing water lines that are now outdated putting in new pumping systems covering up reservoirs
4026826 the number of communities where storm systems are still hooked into sanitary which 50 years ago was the way things were done is causing severe sewer backup problems
4026827 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games
4026828 we still have 10 days to go at the olympics and there are going to be lots of medals coming from canadian athletes
4026829 obviously there is that pressure to try to be the first but this is the olympics this is the biggest pressure cooker you are going to find in competition i thrive on that stuff
4026830 i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have
4026831 i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
4026832 all the hard work and stuff that ive done over the last 23 years is what allowed me to get here
4026833 this is really the show this is where we get to have a good time i got to stand on that mat
4026834 i have appointments where im going over to peoples houses theyll show us their art collections and well do whatever we can to provide them with information about it such as how much it might be worth and then potentially forward that property to auction in either toronto or internationally
4026835 what i sometimes do is take photographs and information down about whatever property collectors want to show us and then ill send it to colleagues in new york
4026836 we had everything cleaned and put away and the oxen in the barn and fed by the time grandfather got home
4026837 he wont bother me ive been stepped on and kicked over the years but i dont let it bother me
4026838 f r die eu und die usa bleibt nur eine m glichkeit ihre rolle in dem konflikt zu verbessern
4026839 georgien zahlt heute f r den zerfall des sowjetischen imperiums anfang der 1990er jahre zur rechtfertigung der milit raktion gegen tiflis hat der russische regierungschef wladimir putin den westen und besonders die amerikaner beschuldigt zum kalten krieg zur ckgekehrt zu sein doch heute geht es nicht um ein gleichgewicht der kr fte als grundlage der beziehungen zwischen zwei bl cken heute erleben wir die r ckkehr zu einer kanonenbootpolitik um einem kleinen land den willen seines m chtigeren nachbarn aufzuzwingen im kaukasus geht es um das recht von v lkern auf selbstbestimmung auch wenn sie das pech haben neben einem m chtigen nachbarn zu leben
4026840 was war das f r ein krieg ein ganz altmodischer machtkrieg um territoriale und wirtschaftliche interessen zwischen einer gro macht und einem kleinen staat hinter dem eine andere gro macht steht wobei diese offiziell nicht beteiligte zweite gro macht die vereinigten staaten nun eine beachtliche niederlage verbuchen m ssen das russische spiel nadelstiche georgischer nervenverlust und gegenangriff russische invasion weitgehendes einlenken des westens scheint aufgegangen zu sein das szenario erinnert frappant an ereignisse des 19 jahrhunderts auf ganz hnliche weise mit dem spiel eines kleinen staates piemont zwischen zwei gro en frankreich und sterreich kam es 1859 zu dem gro en krieg der die italienische einigung erm glichte die sache war vorher zwischen piemont und frankreich abgesprochen nur ging piemont viel weiter als zun chst ausgemacht hnlich kann man pr sident george w bushs besuch in georgien 2005 als eine ermunterung begreifen die der georgische pr sident michail saakaschwili nun gef hrlich berzogen hat da sich hier ein solcher j ngst auch noch vorausgesagter lehrbuchfall der diplomatie ereignet hat bleibt die frage warum amerika nicht imstande war die eskalation zu verhindern
4026841 g be es den georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili nicht wladimir putin h tte ihn erfinden m ssen so wie es scheint traute der russische patron in den ersten stunden des krieges seinen ohren nicht war ihm der als erzfeind eingestufte saakaschwili doch schlie lich mit beiden beinen in die falle gesprungen und hatte russland auf milit rischem feld herausgefordert in wenigen tagen hat putin nicht nur die kontrolle im umk mpften s dossetien wieder bernommen sondern droht auch damit das gesamte georgien auf eine virtuelle gr e zu reduzieren vor allem aber hat putin den usa eine deutliche lektion erteilt erstmals seit dem zusammenbruch der udssr ist das russische imperium in der offensive der krieg in georgien hat f r moskau nicht nur hervorragende regionale auswirkungen er tr gt dazu bei die globalen gewichte neu zu verteilen
4026842 westliche regierungen fordern ma nahmen und rufen nach transatlantischer geschlossenheit aber es ist unklar was diese transatlantische geschlossenheit bedeuten soll soll die nato truppen nach tiflis schicken oder m chte irgendjemand ernsthaft ber ein szenario nachdenken indem die vereinigten staaten und russland in kampfhandlungen gegeneinander verwickelt sind zu wirtschaftssanktionen gegen russland wird es wahrscheinlich auch nicht kommen da moskau mit seinen energielieferungen westeuropa in der mange hat die wahrheit ist russland hat durchschaut dass der westen im fall georgiens nur bluffte und das spiel gewonnen die gr te t uschung war dass der westen georgien wirklich st tzt putin hat all diese t uschungen durchschaut er sah dass die usa gebunden im irak und in afghanistan allein und ambivalent waren in dieser krise auch weil sie noch auf russische unterst tzung f r sanktionen gegen den iran hoffen
4026843 in welche richtung wollen denn nun die usa gehen welche botschaft kann man aus ihrem politischen spiel zwischen anschein und wirklichkeit in georgien herauslesen wenn man nach allen informationen ber das vorgehen dieser gro macht wetten m sste dann sollte man wohl darauf setzen dass sie sich jetzt darauf zubewegt ganz diskret und dennoch eindeutig eine aktive front des kalten krieges in georgien aufzubauen das ist ein erstes und ein sichtbares signal einer internationalen r ckkehr zur geopolitik in dieser gewichtigen auseinandersetzung wie sie nun bereits seit jahren von zahlreichen fachleuten angenommen und oftmals auch heraufbeschworen worden war
4026844 ist der plan f r einen waffenstillstand der unter der gide der franz sischen eu ratspr sidentschaft geschlossen wurde bertrieben vorteilhaft f r die russen segnet er einfach russlands milit rischen sieg ab zahlreich sind jedenfalls jene die das glauben punkt 5 des abkommens ist ganz offensichtlich problematisch die tatsache dass die vereinbarung in keiner weise die territoriale unversehrtheit georgiens erw hnt ist ebenfalls bedenklich
4026845 in georgien ist trotz des waffenstillstands keine ruhe eingekehrt dennoch ergehen die eu au enminister sich in selbstgef lligkeit und freuen sich dar ber dass moskau den vom franz sischen pr sidenten nicolas sarkozy vorgeschlagenen friedensplan akzeptierte dabei haben die russen sich durchgesetzt und ihren willen bekommen ihre vorherrschaft im kaukasus wurde best tigt f r die eu und die usa bleibt nur eine m glichkeit ihre rolle in dem konflikt zu verbessern sie k nnten die aufnahme georgiens in die nato beschleunigen und moskau damit zeigen dass die invasion eines souver nen staates nicht ungestraft bleibt
4026846 thanks a lot for bringing the lousy weather with you
4026847 i bet you werent too happy about our dollar matching yours
4026848 at least i dont have to worry about doing the conversion
4026849 the homes are all in very good repair and painted really very nice
4026850 it wasnt all that long ago that sunday shopping was taboo in nova scotia
4026851 it was only this past year in new york that we allowed liquor stores to be open sunday
4026852 in new york thats all you hear horns even on the neighbourhood roads
4026853 you pay six bucks just for half an hour to park
4026854 what youre saying is we dont know how lucky we are in nova scotia
4026855 i need to come up to nova scotia every few years just to restore my sanity and my faith in people
4026856 were being told that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4026857 we have consistently said that this is an internal matter for the pakistani people
4026858 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
4026859 the two innocent canadians were set upon by a gang of 15 youths some of whom were armed with knives and sticks
4026860 sultan and mohamed were running for their lives from their attackers they did not plan or initiate the murder
4026861 canadian consular officials and the canadian government must increase their efforts in raising the case to the highest levels of the saudi government
4026862 consular officials continue to closely monitor the cases of mohamed and sultan kohail
4026863 the notion they dont even know where these sites are is even more disturbing than the fact they seem to inspect them every three years
4026864 so far this arrangement has been pretty effective other than this incident
4026865 if that means something needs to change with regards to the tssa we will look at all that
4026866 its time for the government to acknowledge that this experimentation this flirtation with privatization has been a failure
4026867 if we felt those were of sufficient magnitude that required an increased level of actions then certainly we would have taken them at the time
4026868 business records change on a continuous basis like any data i know that we make every effort to be as current as possible
4026869 im incredibly competitive and there are so many goals i want to achieve
4026870 im willing to do what it takes to get there i have to improve on my experience and strength
4026871 i know what it takes to be the no 1 player in the world its just a matter of time
4026872 everything that were seeing in terms of the business opportunities and also the progress were making on the restructuring is confirming that our plan is a solid plan and that the execution were getting is good
4026873 i am surprised by how many opportunities there are out there
4026874 many of those opportunities are right within our target space in specialty neurology
4026875 so they are clearly easily within the capability of biovail to do within our existing financial capacity and not overstrain the company
4026876 id love to have had clint at this festival im a huge fan of his directorial work sadly one cant get everything one wants universal studios decided not to offer the film to us
4026877 id be really surprised if he didnt get a best actor nomination for this film
4026878 all doctors are concerned about this and i think that there are major medical impacts
4026879 some of our worst pollution actually occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
4026880 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups this year there have been more than 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the past six years the report said
4026881 so far this year 19 ngo non government organization staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
4026882 is definitely increasing and it is spreading to areas where there was relative security last year
4026883 they the taliban do not care about the ordinary people of afghanistan they have their own agenda
4026884 definitely over this year the security situation has been worsening for both the civilians and humanitarian workers
4026885 i couldnt speculate whether they were targeted because they were irc or because they were the first westerners to go through there or were in the wrong place at the wrong time
4026886 i mean all of those things are possible speculations im sure everyone there over the next few days is going to be doing security assessments just basically looking at those questions
4026887 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4026888 in afghanistan there is a severe drought there is war and the people are being displaced and they need humanitarian assistance
4026889 something has to be done with security by the international community and also from the government of afghanistan
4026890 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4026891 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4026892 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4026893 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4026894 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4026895 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4026896 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4026897 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4026898 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4026899 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4026900 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4026901 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4026902 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4026903 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4026904 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4026905 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4026906 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4026907 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4026908 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4026909 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4026910 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4026911 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4026912 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4026913 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4026914 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4026915 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4026916 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4026968 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful

4026970 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
4026971 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
4026972 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
4026973 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
4026974 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
4026975 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim

4026987 it all begins with the desert aboriginal world view which holds that everything comes from the land all laws ties of kinship ceremony food work activity and good health
4026988 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
4026989 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health to move out of the centralised settlements where government policy had encouraged or forced them to live and to move back to living on or close to their traditional lands and exercise their customary responsibilities to care for that country
4026990 the more aboriginal people are involved on their own terms in caring for country the less likely they are to develop chronic diseases like diabetes or heart disease the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
4026991 there is now growing evidence to show that this is the case
4026992 we are finding the chance to learn from elders on country and to combine this with new skills
4026993 positive spinoffs for the health knowledge and behaviour in young people are being reported to us by aboriginal participants local agency staff and are also evident from our own observations
4026994 as a nation preoccupied with fixing aboriginal problems it is important to remember that information and help can flow two ways

4027112 the antitrust division is committed to putting an end to corruption of competition within the ranks of our military officials and the defense contractors with whom they do business particularly in a time of war
4027113 todays guilty plea should be a very clear message to all who seek to defraud the army that we will catch you and we will bring you to justice
4027114 when an individual or a company participates in this type of illegal activity its only a matter of time before our special agents track you down
4027115 corruption of this nature strikes at the core of what americans expect from our men and women in uniform
4027116 individuals who fail to live up to standards of honor discipline duty responsibility and integrity erode support for the military and undermine confidence in our government the defense criminal investigative service remains steadfastly committed to ensuring that service members who abuse their positions for the sake of personal gain are held responsible
4027117 this plea agreement is the latest example of sigirs efforts in conjunction with our law enforcement agency partners to hold accountable all who seek to undermine the u s reconstruction effort in iraq by abusing the contracting process we will continue to root out individuals engaging in misconduct no one is immune to the consequences of such egregious behavior

4027131 initial contact they said the fbi was investigating and that was not we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them and we got a little concerned about what was happening
4027132 i was just praying to god it went for me
4027133 and then i heard it jeffries great britain unbelievable it means everything to me i am dying to get a medal i have been getting hundred of messages from home and that has been great
4027134 its important to remember that only few months ago daniel was competing in the juniors
4027135 i was trying to boost my score by doing the highest value dismount you can get
4027136 its given me a chance to learn how to cope with nerves and stay calm during pieces which hopefully will help me for london 2012
4027137 i do get nervous i have a little bit of shakes before each piece but ive got to try and sort that out
4027138 daniel improved on his score from the qualifying round and moved up a place which is fantastic
4027139 for me he came of age today it gives me a lot of hope for the next four years his routines are already bristling with difficulty even though hes only a young man and i think hes got the potential to be right up there fighting for medals in london
4027140 hes a british citizen vietnam wants him to go back to the uk
4027141 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look forward to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
4027142 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4027143 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4027144 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4027145 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4027146 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4027147 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4027148 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4027149 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4027150 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4027151 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for four years
4027152 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4027153 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4027154 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4027155 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4027156 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4027157 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4027158 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4027159 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4027160 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4027161 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4027162 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4027163 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4027164 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4027165 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4027189 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4027190 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn

4027313 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4027314 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4027315 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4027316 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4027317 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4027318 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4027319 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4027320 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4027321 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4027322 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4027325 kita harus membawa kasih dan suka cita ke dunia jaman sekarang kita tidak butuh meriam atau bom untuk membawa damai kita hanya butuh kasih dan kemurahan hati dan kita juga butuh kesatuan yang mendalam dengan allah serta doa doa yang disertai pengorbanan diri dan pengorbanan yang disertai dengan adorasi
4027326 simon dari kirene mulai mengikuti yesus ketika dia membantunya memikul salibnya itulah yang kalian muda mudi telah lakukan sepanjang tahun ini sebagai lambang kasihmu ribuan hal yang telah kamu tawarkan kepada yesus dalam diri yang miskin kalian telah menjadi orang kirene sejati setiap kali kalian melakukan perbuatan seperti itu apakah kita siap menghilangkan duka mereka apakah kita siap menanggung penderitaan mereka apakah kita siap atau apakah kita seperti orang sombong yang lewat yang melanjutkan perjalanannya setelah melihat yang kekurangan yesus kembali jatuh berapa kalikah kita membangunkan manusia di jalanan yang telah hidup seperti hewan dan ingin mati seperti malaikat apakah kita siap membantu mereka bangun dia adalah yesus dan dia membutuhkan tangan kalian untuk menyeka wajahnya apakah kalian siap melakukannya apakah kalian akan pergi begitu saja
4027327 demikian juga bagi kita tidaklah penting apa yang kita kerjakan atau dimana kita berada selama kita ingat bahwa kita adalah kepunyaannya bahwa yesus dapat berbuat apa saja sesukanya kepada kita bahwa kita berhutang kasih padanya dan bahwa kita mengasihinya entah kita bekerja bagi orang kaya atau atas nama orang miskin entah kita bekerja diantara orang orang kalangan atas atau para pemukim lingkungan kumuh yang penting hanyalah kasih yang kita tanamkan dalam melaksanakan pekerjaan kita

4027333 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favor particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
4027334 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4027335 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4027336 wha i birthed you and raised you and you get me some frozen pastries
4027337 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4027422 we have to generate the cash to bring in the best players
4027423 i will be working closely with michael reid in trying to attract sponsors to come in and for people to buy into the idea that for ulster to go forward we have to get facilities that match the rest of the stadia of the clubs in the uk and ireland
4027424 when you see what munster and leinster have now and so many of the english premiership clubs if you are trying to attract top players in you have got to be able to show them facilities that are at least comparable to the likes of leicester and wasps
4027425 we need to engage more with the business community and bring the supporters in behind us to see what we are trying to achieve
4027426 in the current financial climate it is difficult and it is not going to happen overnight but the goal within two or three years is to have the facilities at ravenhill and at newforge where the team train that we can be proud of
4027427 we hope to have the stand up and running within 12 months and the idea is that after two or three years it will have paid for itself and will be generating more money which ultimately will go to recruiting better players
4027428 we want to see players who have played international rugby at the top level but to do that everything has to be in place in terms of facilities and you have to be able to pay them and salaries at the minute are going up and up and up as the demand for top quality players rises
4027429 the difficulty was that last year a lot of our top players who had originally agreed two three or four year deals all came off together which made it seem a lot worse than purely in numbers terms as it is probably the same number every year
4027430 if you are trying to build a team it doesnt matter what sport you want to build the team around your best players and you want them committing to play for ulster
4027431 andrew falls into the same category what they bring is everything you want from an ulster rugby player and we will be trying very hard to keep andrew
4027432 but he has got to see that what we have got here is as good as anywhere else and got to be playing winning rugby because he is hugely ambitious
4027433 there are a new generation of players coming through and it is up to them to drive ulster forward and take us back to where where we think we should be
4027434 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4027435 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4027436 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4027437 its amazing how far she has come in six years and its like shes completing the cycle coming from a reality show having a hugely successful career and now shes judging future stars
4027438 the great thing about cheryl is that she knows exactly what the contestants are going through because she has been there and done it so can offer them all really good advice and empathise with how they feel
4027439 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4027440 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4027441 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4027442 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4027443 its becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible
4027444 there have been plenty of stories lately involving the type of behaviour that is completely inappropriate for a work environment people need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences
4027445 always employ your usual good manners when online work out who your true frolleagues are and remember that social networking is meant to enhance your social and professional life not obliterate it
4027446 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
4027447 the role of gigantic corporations in food production was leading humanity towards absolute disaster driving small farmers off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unimaginable awfulness
4027448 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4027449 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4027450 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
4027451 los angeles and san francisco shows have been overwhelming and i am looking forward to visiting other cities and reaching out to my fans i have worked with aishwarya and preity before and that has been great also there is a great comfort level in our team and this has been an unforgettable experience
4027452 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4027453 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter

4027462 we denied that we were tired we denied that we were scared we denied how badly we wanted to succeed and most importantly we denied that we were in denial we only see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe and it works we lie to ourselves so much that after a while the lie certainly seems like the truth we denied so much that we can not recognize the truth right in front of our faces but sometimes reality has a way of sneaking out and biting us in the ass and when the things arises all you can do is swim the world what we pretend is a cage not a cocoon we can not lie to ourselves for so long we all tired we all scared deny it doesnt change the truth sooner or later we have to put outside our denial and face the world denial is not just a river in egypt but a freak ocean so how do you keep from jumping in it
4027463 we deeply regret that high levels of noise are currently being generated on our construction site however the ground conditions make pile foundations necessary in order to ensure the stability of the structures

4027477 you havent changed nice to see you all i wouldnt want you to change you were so loveable in your old form
4027478 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4027479 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4027480 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4027481 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4027482 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4027483 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4027484 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4027485 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4027486 the mining stocks rallied though after stronger base metals prices overnight ms simpson said
4027487 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4027488 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4027489 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4027490 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot

4027512 to be a place where students are not only educated but nurtured as well a place where students are encouraged to look withinto become successful leaving high school prepared for the challenges of life
4027513 the state makes it clear that the purpose of the ale is to help students recover grades or credits
4027514 there is a list of criteria a student must meet before being recommended for the ale
4027515 students study basic courses and upon passing the tabe test of adult basic education are recommended to local adult education facilities where they continue to work toward an arkansas high school diploma
4027516 its self paced and that allows the student to move at his or her own speed we havea good success rate
4027517 there is really no way to anticipate how many students will need the recovery program or the ged program this year 2008 2009
4027518 the districts principals and counselors will look over transcripts and begin the process of recommending students to the program
4027519 from those 50 students six graduated high school with a high school diploma three received their ged diplomas and 27 returned to regular school having completed their credit recovery
4027520 as you can see we had some great success its the other 14 students who concern me who were not successful but we will try harder this year
4027521 we have state of the art programs a plato lab for the students to use as well as distance learning that enables our students to take a variety of courses
4027522 we have about 70 percent participation thats a real testament to our parents they realize parental involvement is necessary to their students success

4027539 i think i already have got off to a good start
4027540 im feeling positive vibes out here my routes are good im consistently catching the ball and im feeling confident about my game
4027541 just give me more opportunities to go out there and catch balls and make plays and everything will be great
4027542 i know its just preseason but its always good to get back into the season mode especially for a receiver you have to get the speed of the game down and get a little contact in
4027543 the last two seasons from midseason on reggie has played very well
4027544 reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4027545 im going to go out and make plays and do my job
4027546 it would be great if hes going to contribute if we have more receivers to go out and help the team thats awesome you want a deep squad the more the merrier
4027547 i had a tendency to work on my strengths instead of my weaknesses and i tried to reverse that this year
4027548 thats something i wanted to work on i went out and bought a couple of ball machines i put one in georgia and had one in jersey wherever i went i wanted to get catches and keep my eyes focused that helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4027549 the thing about me is i always get ahead of myself
4027550 i look back and think about the mistakes i made and then i think about the ones i might make as long as i stay right here right now that will help me as a receiver
4027551 the last 2 years from midseason on reggie has played very well reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4027552 i feel like i already got off to a good start in workouts
4027553 im feeling some positive vibes out here about what im doing my routes are good consistency catching the ball im feeling confident about my game as long as it tranfers to the season and to the games everything is going to be all right
4027554 thats great more receivers to go out there and make plays and help the team thats awesome you want that the more the merrier
4027555 i dont want to look ahead i want to stay right here right now every day one practice at a time as long as i do that and dont get ahead of myself then everything works out
4027556 mistakes you made mistakes you might make i need to stay right here right now thatll help me progress as a receiver
4027557 had a tendency to work on my strengths a little bit more than i have my weaknesses ive tried to reverse that this year
4027558 so wherever i went i would be able to get catches in and keep my eyes focused its helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4027559 i have him plugged in there to do that if i think that leg is getting fatigued or if he is giving an indicator that it is then well get him out of there i dont want to take any steps back there
4027560 i think he has handled the last few days very well but im not na ve to the problem either
4027561 i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4027562 die j ngsten deutlichen strompreiserh hungen mit der aussicht auf zuk nftig drastisch weiter steigende energiekosten aber auch das gestiegene umweltbewusstsein und die hohe medienpr senz des themas bringen neue impulse f r mehr wettbewerb in den teils immer noch verschlafen wirkenden strommarkt

4027565 right now were just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4027566 he had told me he had been working out and we put him through some things the last couple days
4027567 i think he has handled the last few days well
4027568 but im not naive to the problem either i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4027569 it shook him up a little bit obviously but hes doing ok
4027570 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4027571 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4027572 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4027573 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4027574 his ability to get open and his ability to get downfield have been impressive
4027575 he can create separation and the quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him which is pretty unusual for a rookie it didnt take long for them to figure out he was getting open
4027576 he is one of the faster ones that i have coached
4027577 there are a couple of things that he has that allows him to be a really fast learner first of all hes a natural player his movements are just natural he does a lot of things that we teach that he just does naturally secondly hes really sharp footballwise really for him it takes him once or twice maybe three reps and hes got it he can take it from the classroom to the field very quickly as well those are all good things weve got a long way to go and hes got a long way to go hes done a nice job up to this point
4027578 i felt like i did a pretty good job for the first nfl game
4027579 watching the film and watching my mistakes theres a lot i can get better on the biggest thing is just looking at film and see the things i have to correct
4027580 the offense is very tough not an easy thing especially for a rookie youve got to put a lot of hard work into it a lot of time you have to focus on the keys of the offense its definitely tough
4027581 every time you catch a punt here someone is right in your face
4027582 i have to adjust to it but im doing pretty good you have to have vision you have to know where your blockers are setting up the biggest thing is you cant mess around back there you have to make your move and get up the field
4027583 i did the same schedule at trials and this time im more rested i had a stomach disorder that just ended two days ago im feeling really good
4027584 i was surprised to win the gold in world record time i have never imagined that i could win gold in the olympic games
4027585 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten i have been working for years and years i didnt panic during the race when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it its a great joy to be here i want to enjoy the moment
4027586 i definitely wasnt going to make the same mistake i made four years ago where i took the preliminaries too easy its been eating at me for a long time so to go out and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing after for years

4027642 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false

4027644 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4027645 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance

4027664 what has happened today i believe is a landmark in australian legal history
4027665 the settlement involves a judgment for the claimant mr selim but does not involve the commonwealth conceding any of the specific allegations in the proceedings
4027666 i think that mr selims actions and the events of today have now opened the door for other people to now seek compensation from the government
4027667 i believe there will be a great number of shareholders and significant number of customers of pan and service providers who will now be looking to the government to be compensated
4027668 it has come at a great personal cost which cannot be fully compensated by any agreed amount of damages

4027709 hes profiled in an article for the chronical review which serves as a fantastic introduction to the man his work and his controversial foray into politics lakoff is particularly interesting because he advised the us democratic party on the use of language and in framing debates meaning they are described with metaphors that automatically conjure up positive ideas and concepts that are favourable to the policy under discussion
4027710 lakoffs foray into politics is a story marked by intellectual breakthroughs the allure of influence and a fall from great heights yet his lifetime work permeates several disciplines and continues to spur cognitive researchers to go off in new directions
4027711 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return

4027722 im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title
4027723 i know b j s gameplan is to win the welterweight title and defend both belts at the same time i dont know if danas going to allow him to do that
4027724 if he beats gsp is he going to stay in the welterweight division if he loses its probably more probable that hell go back to 155 so i dont know theres a lot of ifs

4027745 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4027746 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4027747 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4027748 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4027766 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4027767 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
4027768 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm

4027786 maar zelfs als je de buitenlanders buiten beschouwing laat dan scoren de belgische profvoetballers over het algemeen nog altijd niet beter dan hun amateurcollegas
4027787 koolhydraten zijn nochtans cruciaal en met speciaal aangepaste voeding kan je het suikergehalte in de spieren verdubbelen en ook pieken naar bepaalde dagen eerder onderzoek heeft echter aangewezen dat sommige voetballers zelfs met lagere gehaltes aan wedstrijden beginnen dan gewone mensen gevolg is dat hun prestaties in de tweede helft drastisch achteruit gaan
4027788 terwijl voldoende vocht opnemen voor en tijdens een wedstrijd doorslaggevend is bij 2 procent verlies aan lichaamsgewicht door vochtverlies verlies je immers 10 pct van je fysieke capaciteiten bij 5 procent is dat al 33 pct
4027789 voetballers overschatten ook het suikergehalte dat sportdranken zouden moeten hebben bovendien waren er maar liefst 22 profs die dachten dat red bull tijdens een wedstrijd best kan terwijl amper vijf amateurs hetzelfde idee hadden wie zon energiedrank tijdens een match drinkt krijgt kort nadien echter een ongelooflijke dip
4027790 sommige ploegen zorgen er wel voor dat hun spelers zoveel mogelijk op de club eten maar anderen doen dat behalve op wedstrijddagen helemaal niet bovendien eten heel wat spelers uiteraard ook thuis er is bijvoorbeeld nauwelijks sprake van op maat gemaakte di ten zoals bij europese topclubs wel het geval is

4027801 once we came back i felt pretty good about our chances
4027802 their pinch hitter did a heck of a job he doubled down the line coming off the bench and thats outstanding
4027803 he could have walked in there and talked to the pitcher but he was motioning to me
4027804 he wasnt quite looking at the pitcher when he threw over there which was why jeff threw it wild
4027805 unfortunately we didnt execute in the bottom of the ninth inning
4027806 theres no doubt were going to go up there and put some solid at bats together
4027807 we pushed toward coming back and we did its a sign of the kind of team we have
4027808 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
4027809 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well
4027810 they are getting better each game and what you can expect from spain is they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it
4027811 weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
4027812 i said to my assistant coach maybe the lights will go out now and it could be over
4027813 i did not expect to see such a high level of competition it was really hard for the judges it is great that ntdtv held such an event which so profoundly demonstrates traditional chinese culture

4027830 weve had a legacy of having really fast cars i think of having generally pretty good engines and better than average luck there
4027831 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want
4027832 you can go two and three wide on that downforce racetrack for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
4027833 to run two feet off the wall at michigan is id like to say a dangerous line because one little mistake and it wipes the right side of the car off

4027840 theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
4027841 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
4027842 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
4027843 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
4027844 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
4027845 ford was given three reasons for the funding cut he was too old his performances over the past two years werent good enough and his sport wasnt culturally significant enough in canada
4027846 i made the final and i finished sixth at an olympics thats not bad but it wasnt why i came
4027847 losing funding and things like that i missed the last training camp here as a result and everyone ahead of me didnt so youve got those questions in the back of your head did i do everything i needed to do to be prepared here i did what i could with the resources i had
4027848 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
4027849 despite some bright spots our summer olympic team is not very good
4027850 diving is not here to support canada on its own
4027851 the games have just started people are still training for their events theyre still competing and the medals are going to come
4027852 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
4027853 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
4027854 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
4027855 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
4027856 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure

4027867 going into this year i felt great i put a smile on my face as much as possible and enjoyed and joked around with my teammates
4027868 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
4027869 im trying to put it all in perspective immediately its not so easy but its just really tough you train so long and i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody
4027870 i wish none of you ever have to go through this feeling of loss and feeling of disappointment and the only thing that i can say is its definitely not going to kill me so it will have to make me stronger
4027871 wow sorry it hasnt sunk in yet give me a couple of brandies and well feel better
4027872 my psychologist is going to kill me if he reads this
4027873 hes going to be like all that work we did and you cant accept your losses
4027874 i honestly didnt want to live after i lost in athens
4027875 i was like i am such a loser i dont deserve to live and now im just feeling like you know what i lost but i was well prepared i just didnt do what i had to do in the last three minutes
4027876 im going to keep it in perspective right now theres a war in georgia and people are dying and thats why this morning i felt so good coming in i just felt lucky im lucky that im alive first of all and lucky i can come and do my sport at the olympics it really sucks to lose its so painful but it doesnt make me more worthy or less worthy as a person its really just a match
4027877 the one thing about canadians is we love our sports be it hockey or football
4027878 despite me being in the nfl i was also a fan of the cfl so i understand that theyre loyal to their teams its ok if theyre going to be out there in protest but its all for a love of the game if you guys love football then support it
4027879 i know what its like because when i was coming up the browns left cleveland
4027880 we just have to play where its deemed for us to play but i certainly know the feeling
4027881 somebodys got to be north americas team right it might as well be us
4027882 im looking forward to getting toronto people to believe in the bills and make it like a home away from home
4027883 i think people understand we have always tried to regionalize our product
4027884 they see what weve done in rochester where the bills hold their training camp over the past decade
4027885 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
4027886 in my announcement on may 13 i said i was stepping away
4027887 i never used the r word retirement that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
4027888 golf has been tremendous to me and thats one reason i want to stay within the game because i really love it
4027889 but what im not going to miss and one of the reasons im stepping away is that its really hard work to grind every day
4027890 its tough to travel every week ive dedicated my life to it pretty much since i picked up a club its over 20 years its been living breathing eating and sleeping golf so its time golf is part of life but its not life
4027891 if she goes out and doesnt miss practice and playing then shes not coming back
4027892 if she has a couple of kids and stays busy she has no reason to come back
4027893 i think one year at a time and well see how it goes i think it would be great to see her in five six years playing at the u s open or something and we can all enjoy her one more time
4027894 im doing the best i can to stay focused on the game
4027895 its never been about a farewell tour or about saying goodbye other than im here and i want to support each tournament
4027896 but i also want to win im a competitor but having said that i have not performed as well since i made my announcement maybe theres something unconsciously telling me its ok
4027897 lorena is leading the charge now and shes a fantastic person and a great golfer so i feel like the tour is in great hands
4027898 i cant think of a better spot than maybe march meadows in honeymoon bay on vancouver island to wind up my career but you cant host an event there
4027899 but its nice to see a lot of old friends and come back to a golf course that we played before in 1994 thats phenomenal
4027900 i can say so far its my favourite place on tour i love that its old and very traditional
4027901 it was an exciting game we need that kind of game the way everybody kind of relaxed loosened up weve got two more months to decide where were going to be at the end of the season so thats the kind of game that puts you in the mood and gets you going all the way
4027902 even more than that was to see the last out
4027903 thats an interesting night at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal
4027904 that had a chance to be a really frustrating night and in the end the musics playing and we won thats what we set out to do thats not exactly how we drew it up
4027905 i was unaware of the scenario in which she said it i didnt think twice about it and im not focusing on it at all
4027906 i dont have a grudge or any ill feelings toward her whatsoever
4027907 everythings on my side to do well i just have to do it on the day but i cant predict what the others will do
4027908 we are expecting a very close game as it is a huge rivalry for both of us
4027909 everything ive done over the last two or three years with this horse is to get ready for that
4027910 jeff pitta and the staff at continental insurance made lowering my car insurance rate so easy
4027911 im reviewing everything to determine what it is thats blocking us
4027912 perhaps after these games it will be clear they will be the only outliers and have to allow women to compete
4027913 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action
4027914 all that would do is have the athletes of that country suffer
4027915 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
4027916 herkulesstauden auch auf dem gebiet des stadtbads rechts neben dem eingang linkes okerufer leider seit jahren trotz hinweis danke

4027918 jesus why dont you come and rescue me i can be of some use to you

4027920 and todays news items help make it hard to argue based on some new research piper jaffrays gene munster
4027921 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4027922 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
4027923 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
4027924 she got to the point where she could joke about it
4027925 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
4027926 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
4027927 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
4027928 who is your lord who sand you who is using you to disrupt this meeting
4027929 tonight the city is full of morgues and all the toilets are overflowing
4027930 with the laws of a brothel and the fireproof bones of a preacher with your lingo coined from the sacrament of a casino on a government loan with a guillotine in your libido
4027931 tied my leg to a barricade with a plastic hand grenade
4027932 we can live in a hollow tree grow a boat and bury the sea
4027933 as multinational companies address rising health care costs todays emerging trend is to take a global approach to employee health
4027934 but before a company embarks on this approach it needs to think critically identifying and evaluating the specific issues that will affect outcomes such as cultural and language differences insight international is a tool that allows employers to pinpoint these issues
4027935 first keep the questionnaire short our international hra takes 10 15 minutes to complete for the slowest participants second make it easy to access and complete so we only offer it online and third keep the basic participant report short so employees can easily read and absorb the information
4027936 wow what is happening of course we understood that with being in the presence of god for so many hours a day and having your faith fed and watered it is impossible to stay the same and not be moved next year we are taking more people
4027937 als je het negen jaar volgehouden hebt in de jeugd van barcelona dan kun je natuurlijk wel voetballen het is een balvaste jongen een persoonlijkheid op het veld
4027938 i was having breakfast at the peninsula hotel in chicago and we had gotten a text message and of course we just we had written it off as the rumour the same rumour that had happened the week before so we didnt think anything of it
4027939 and then reverend al sharpton walked into the restaurant and came up to me and said im so sorry about your boy
4027940 they extorted money from the executive by threatening to reveal his past to the company boss
4027941 they squeezed money from the owner of the business by threatening him
4027942 one of the fundamental pillars of the identity of amazonian peoples

4027944 our objective is to deliver the best quality service available to women in ireland and we believe that we are now in a position to deliver on that promise we are confident that we can now implement a highly organised quality assured screening programme which will save many lives
4027945 this worryingly high figure indicates that the 2007 figures will be repeated or even exceeded cancelled operations have a real impact on patients
4027946 the absence of long stay beds and community support for people who are currently in acute beds but need more appropriate rehabilitation convalescent or long term care adds to the problem
4027947 tests performed on my son revealed he had been suffering from brain damage caused by trauma during his career as a wrestler
4027948 known as cte chronic traumatic encephalopathy this type of brain damage can cause irrational and erratic behaviour depression and paranoia and likely influenced the tragedy that took our family
4027949 the wwe suggests that if concussions caused this tragedy why have we not witnessed someone like nhl hockey player eric lindros committing some form of violence
4027950 what they fail to mention is the fact that during his pro career eric only played one complete season in all the other years he missed games due to injuries some of which were concussion related
4027951 on the other hand my son would suffer a concussion and wrestle the very next night the very worst thing that can happen to anyone suffering from a concussion is to experience trauma to the head within hours or days of the incident
4027952 dr julian bailes at the center for the study of retired athletes university of north carolina studied the after effects of concussions among 3 000 former nfl players in their retirement years and many of them in their 50s are having severe mental and cognitive problems
4027953 it was a time of incredible grief but it was necessary
4027954 we need to conduct more research to understand the full spectrum of the disease and raise awareness so parents coaches medical staff and athletic officials know how to respond when athletes including children sustain head injuries
4027955 unfortunately chris will only be remembered for the last three days of his life and i understand that
4027956 the person who committed those horrendous acts is not the son we knew and loved that is why i am so committed to understanding the underlying causes of this tragedy
4027957 were made on my quest to understand ritual and belief systems in medicinal plant usage in bolivia and peru the ones presented are those ive gathered to date that best recreate the psychic and spiritual experiences of my journey
4027958 to do like art asks to suspend disbelief to not exclude any possibility or any observation no matter how strange and exotic
4027959 they killed my father with witchcraft and not with a bullet with killings like this through witchcraft there arent any witnesses i can talk about all this i can go to lawyers but nobody will believe me
4027960 compounded with the correct percentages of dmt and beta carbolines
4027961 when dmt levels get too high for normal function we start undergoing unusual experiences
4027962 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4027963 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4027964 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4027965 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4027966 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4027967 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4027968 the civilian population should be protected against all encroachments on their lives and dignity
4027969 we needed to have an offensive night like this that is huge for us
4027970 more than anything he is learning learning the pitchers and learning what to do in the clubhouse i know it has been a good experience for him we cant expect him to do anything more
4027971 the bullpen has been getting up and down a lot
4027972 it made sense to take me out but i would have liked to go one more inning
4027973 we are all very relieved that its just a bone bruise
4027974 i told him that there were a lot of worse places he could have gotten hit pitching hand pitching elbow shoulder face you name it
4027975 it just means that youre old and doing this and somebody keeps being silly enough to give you a job
4027976 we took it out of the locker and wore it had some fun with it up there a little bit
4027977 did some headfirst slides you slide a lot farther than he can down here
4027978 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4027979 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
4027980 we outplayed them for two innings and they outplayed us for seven
4027981 its one of those games you just really have to battle though
4027982 i was no help to my team going out there and being of no help trying to be a hero instead of saying you know what i cant do it its a stupid thing on my part if you cant do it you cant do it
4027983 but at the same time if hes hurting hes hurting if his back is bothering him he cant play
4027984 but at the same time i dont expect it to happen anymore
4027985 can we get it done i dont know because were not getting it done your performance speaks for itself its not like theyre not trying or anything like that weve got some weak spots can we get it done so far were having a hard time proving that
4027986 hell never tell you that he cant play but by saying that its kind of sore and its throbbing all night you kind of get the feeling that its pretty rough
4027987 its just been a struggle as of late for him to get back to 260 or 270 get his head above water
4027988 i shouldnt have gone out there it was stupid im wasting the teams time by trying to go out there and be a hero
4027989 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4027990 i think that was probably about three weeks ago i think ive learned to overcome i cant affect that sort of outcome all i know is that i can go out there and throw one pitch at a time wherever they hit it so be it just try to limit the runs i felt i definitely did a good job of it
4027991 im just trying to get on base this has been a fun two games for us and were doing things and scoring and winning in different ways a lot of guys were great tonight and the last couple of nights its just a lot of fun when things come together and you win
4027992 hes got a lot more pop than ive given him credit for with lowell out hes the guy who can step up and really carry us hes been fun to watch
4027993 its just fun to come up to the plate and have people on base all the time i think this ballpark is really conducive to a righthanded hitter ive been here like 12 days and i feel as if ive been here all year its really felt comfortable for me
4027994 i just go up and try to get hits or a walk get on base
4027995 you cant worry about where you hit when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today you go up you have the same number on your back you have to have the same at bats
4027996 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter we set out to win tonight and we did we made it more interesting than we needed to
4027997 hes becoming one of the premier lefthanders in the game
4027998 hes starting to be one of those guys the team can depend on every time he pitches now hes getting dominating hes reminding people of a younger andy pettitte every time he goes out there its great to watch young pitchers develop and blossom and this kid has done that before our very eyes after all hes been through with the cancer the red sox have a no 1 lefthanded starter theyre hard to find
4027999 were thrilled to announce that we have a deal with apple to bring the iphone to canada later this year
4028000 we cant tell you any more about it right now but stay tuned
4028001 bells got the unlimited usage for the htc touch phone so it wouldnt surprise me if rogers and apple have come up with some sort of iphone specific plan
4028002 apple was pretty hesitant about releasing the iphone without an unlimited data plan so they must have struck a delicate balance if theres some sort of unlimited or really attractive data plan that would entice users to consider it as well
4028003 youre not going to see an unlimited plan but instead bigger buckets maybe a five gigabyte data plan which is kind of like an unlimited plan for the average user
4028004 the 3g version of the iphone will most likely be coming in june
4028005 rogers is actually rolling out its full 3g capable network as well so it would be an attractive fit to launch with the new g3 iphones
4028006 both companies have realized that the same device can service both markets
4028007 rim has introduced more applications and consumer oriented features while apple will be introducing the next generation 3g iphone and were going to have exchange server support
4028008 like it or not i think the iphone is going to migrate its way to the enterprise and it managers are going to have to deal with that
4028009 the trend were seeing in business is users bringing devices into the networks and then it having to scramble in order to make them work
4028010 the enabling activation and setup of the iphones done by connecting the device to your computer via usb cord and then firing up itunes
4028011 i think a lot of enterprise users would have liked to have seen it enabled with over the air sync and provisioning of your settings as of right now when you buy the things its as dead as a doornail without itunes which not too many enterprises will be happy about
4028012 now that the apple sdk is out there with developers were hoping to see some innovative and interesting applications for the iphone
4028013 rim has done a bang up job in getting business applications developed and run on the blackberry platform
4028014 hai ahli kitab marilah berpegang kepada suatu kalimat ketetapan yang tidak ada perselisihan antara kami dan kamu bahwa tidak kita sembah kecuali allah dan tidak kita persekutukan dia dengan sesuatu pun dan tidak pula sebagian kita menjadikan sebagian yang lain sebagai tuhan selain allah
4028015 saksikanlah bahwa kami adalah orang orang yang berserah diri kepada allah
4028016 fornication and asphyxiation and choking and fighting for survival and growing and just rotting away
4028017 our guide to nature or our guide to the prehistoric past
4028018 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4028019 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
4028020 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4028021 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4028022 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4028023 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4028024 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows
4028025 late yesterday morning we located human remains that we believe are the human remains of leeanne mintern
4028026 she was located in a shallow grave forensic police are there at the moment gathering evidence and retrieving those remains
4028027 were quietly confident that it is her but we have to have a formal identification which may have to be done through dna
4028028 obviously her family were quite upset they were hoping that she would be alive somewhere
4028029 as soon as you hear the word lottery everyone assumes that it was financially motivated
4028030 i think we fell into that trap in the last month and it has cost us worrying about opposition teams results
4028031 weve gotten away from our own focus of winning games of football and started looking behind our back a bit
4028032 we looked ahead too and we cant do that any more because theres no bigger game than geelong
4028033 if you start looking ahead against a team like geelong youve got a problem
4028034 last time we played them we stuck with them for three quarters and then gary ablett blew us away in the last quarter
4028035 it does give you confidence to know you can go with them
4028036 last week fremantle was a game where we just wanted to get the win and get our confidence up to give us that momentum going into this week so we could play like we did against geelong earlier in the season
4028037 i have to weigh up if its all worth it
4028038 im concerned about him because ive been told the same advice that hes been told
4028039 ill be concerned about him if he decides to play thats for sure
4028040 i think it says a lot about the character of the fellow that hes even thinking about playing
4028041 he knows things arent going to change too much with his arm in one week and hes basically putting his arm on the line for his team
4028042 you have to know the type of guy he is
4028043 some guys who arent team orientated it doesnt affect that much but hes a guy who is totally all about his teammates
4028044 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
4028045 if you are not 100 per cent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can
4028046 the win two weeks ago was satisfying but its easy to do one its about being able to back that performance up and thats what were trying to do
4028047 how a backrower operates comes off what happens in front of you
4028048 the last match was a great indicator of that the front five got stuck in and made our jobs a lot easier
4028049 he adds a lot of energy there and in the physical side of things he is always in amongst it
4028050 how effective you are depends on whether you get front foot ball or not i know certainly when you dont have front foot ball he can be a real menace
4028051 but for this all black team we want to make sure every time we go into a tri nations or any test we perform as well as we can and hopefully get the results were after
4028052 we have two games left and if we can win those two games we give ourselves a chance
4028053 to prevent and combat abuse of psychotropic substances and the illicit traffic to which it gives rise
4028054 all use except for scientific and very limited medical purposes
4028055 by certain amazon ethnic groups in magical and religious rites and in rites of initiation into adulthood
4028056 a preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic substance which it contains
4028057 any solution or mixture in whatever physical state containing one or more psychotropic substances
4028058 plants as such are not and it is submitted are also not likely to be listed in schedule i but only some products obtained from plants
4028059 this government especially after moving on indo us nuclear deal is moving soft on us they are opposing for the time being may be for political reasons but i have my doubts entire drama may be stage managed
4028060 look at the way kamal nath has said the talks are in a state of pause this is dangerous
4028061 in may 2008 the state government announced its intention to increase liquor licensing fees this gives stonnington the opportunity to advocate to state government that the fee increase should be substantial and revenue from extra fees is directed to extra policing to counter alcohol related crime
4028062 i thought that was why we pay taxes the council seems to think we have endless supplies of money but this proposal would send a lot of us broke
4028063 it is obviously not the responsibility of council to be advocating the increase of license fees to the state government
4028064 you should not have a copy of this document anyway and i know whos responsible for leaking it
4028065 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4028066 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4028067 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4028068 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4028069 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4028070 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4028071 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4028072 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4028073 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4028074 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4028075 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4028076 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4028077 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4028078 i sing loud because im not afraid to let people know what i know
4028079 while you are alone with the sounds of the jungle and its animals
4028080 it is a real concert a choir that is the silence of the jungle
4028081 the plant talks to you it teaches you to sing
4028082 as if the song were in my ears and on my tongue
4028083 hai ahli kitab marilah berpegang kepada suatu kalimat ketetapan yang tidak ada perselisihan antara kami dan kamu bahwa tidak kita sembah kecuali allah dan tidak kita persekutukan dia dengan sesuatu pun dan tidak pula sebagian kita menjadikan sebagian yang lain sebagai tuhan selain allah

4028085 some subjects felt that certain scenes they saw had really happened and that they had been disembodied witnesses of them in a different time and place
4028086 peoples faces movies of all sorts playing at high speeds and animal presences such as snakes
4028087 a physicality unlike those of any other entheogen id experienced
4028088 jungle like places full of imagery of vines fountains and animals
4028089 reds and golds dazzling in diamonds that turned like dancers on the tips of distant highways
4028090 indonesia three militants awaiting execution for the 2002 bali bombings plan to challenge the legality of death by firing squad but it was unclear if the move would today lodge a fresh legal challenge to their impending executions

4028093 e come una droga per te bella ormai ho capito che senza di lui non puoi vivere e troppo tardi ma io sarei stato una scelta pi sana non una droga io sarei stato laria il sole
4028094 anche io ne ero convinta sai eri come il sole il mio sole personale il rimedio migliore alle mie nuvole
4028095 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno

4028133 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity

4028150 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4028151 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4028152 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4028153 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4028154 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4028155 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4028156 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4028157 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4028158 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4028159 man you cant do that you totally suck at drawing find something better plz
4028160 may be easy but boring and whyyyy would you do this you dont even like people that much
4028161 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4028162 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4028163 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4028164 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4028165 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4028166 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4028167 if fire should move in naturally were comfortable with that
4028168 but if you bring a drip torch into the vatican and intend to ignite it you are going to have some opposition
4028169 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4028170 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4028171 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
4028172 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4028173 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4028174 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
4028175 i did tell eric on the phone the day before i came up i said hey i want to play as soon as possible
4028176 i wouldve played three plays the other night at cleveland but that wouldve been ugly i dont know i think well just play it by ear
4028177 you cant afford to do that during the season so i hope that were getting that out of our system now those were my fault i overthrew one underthrew another one i think thats where a week from now well be much better
4028178 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4028179 we tore it down at the same time of the storm there were no lights the building was falling down and shook the ground and the entire fire department came around here and some people were scared
4028180 compared to some of the hoops the city makes others jump through theyre not making this guy do anything
4028181 hes a british citizen vietnam wants him to go back to the uk
4028182 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up with the jail psychiatrist

4028186 we doen er alles aan om die situatie deze keer te voorkomen
4028187 we doen er altijd alles aan om te zorgen dat er niets uitlekt maar deze keer is het echt hysterisch harde schijven die worden vernietigd en alles erop en eraan
4028188 de eindredacteur had de fotos al bijna gewist uit zijn mailbox nog voordat ik ze had gezien
4028189 het zijn totaal andere plaatjes dan de vorige keer toen was het iets klassieker nu zijn het echt vrolijke fotos geworden
4028190 het was mogelijk om met hetzelfde team te werken omdat de omgeving heel anders was
4028191 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4028192 if fire should move in naturally were comfortable with that
4028193 but if you bring a drip torch into the vatican and intend to ignite it you are going to have some opposition
4028194 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4028195 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4028196 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4028197 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4028198 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4028199 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4028200 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4028201 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4028202 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4028203 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4028204 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4028205 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4028206 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4028207 i think the administration has most of what they need
4028208 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly
4028209 het verbaast me dat jullie die doorgesnoven cokehoer niet noemen
4028210 hij heeft me twee weken geleden vanaf ibiza al dat hij iets heel stoms heeft gedaan
4028211 hij heeft er ontzettend veel spijt van en heeft zijn excuses aangeboden
4028212 hij is niet zo blij met de weergave van het interview
4028213 wij leerden elkaar kennen toen het even uit was met aafke maar er is nooit sprake geweest van heftige escapades
4028214 onze relatie strandde kort nadat we in 2006 remigreerden vanuit bonaire na een pauze van twee jaar hebben we elkaar weer gevonden sinds valentijnsdag dit jaar vormen we weer cht een gezin
4028215 ik heb deze tijd gebruikt om helemaal tot mezelf gekomen ik ontdekte dat weglopen voor jezelf en een ander de schuld geven van je eigen tekortkomingen je niet verder brengen met deze persoonlijke groei kwam er ook weer ruimte voor mijn liefde voor frans n mijn liefde voor het acteren vanaf begin september ben ik te zien in de film panman rhythm of the palms
4028216 frans en ik leefden vanaf het begin van onze relatie in de hoogste versnelling ik geloof dat we na onze eerste nacht samen meteen samenwoonden
4028217 zeven maanden later was ik zwanger bovendien woonden we nooit langer dan n jaar op dezelfde plek het was een vreselijk onrustige tijd
4028218 maar de horeca daar was niet wat we ervan verwachtten na elf maanden keerden we terug naar nederland
4028219 als stel kregen we het moeilijk en een paar maanden na onze remigratie gingen frans en ik uit elkaar al dat rennen en vliegen had zich gewroken we waren elkaar onderweg kwijtgeraakt
4028220 ik ontdekte dat ik vluchtgedrag vertoonde ging moeilijke situaties liever uit de weg ook ging ik inzien dat een ander de schuld geven je niet verder brengt de neiging om mijn leven drastisch om te gooien zit gewoon in mij
4028221 frans is de meest pure en meest manlijke man die ik ken we zijn allebei tot onszelf gekomen en daarom doen we nu alles over maar dan wel in de eerste versnelling
4028222 martin fowler then talked about ignaz semmelweis a hospital administrator in 19th century vienna who discovered that the mortality rate in a maternity clinic could be drastically cut by making doctors wash their hands when moving between the autopsy ward and the maternity ward

4028227 ben made choices that night to consume alcohol and he consumed alcohol in excess and that led to his death
4028228 these boys made a mistake by providing the alcohol and having it available at a fraternity party to underage drinkers
4028229 we fully expect our members to abide by uphold and support the laws of the land including laws pertaining to alcohol purchase consumption and use
4028230 while we acknowledge bens errors in judgment we do not believe his errors overshadow his goodness
4028231 our first thoughts are with the sprague family and continue to be with them since this is just another sad day for their family and for the clemson family
4028232 we agreed it would be very good for us and the industry
4028233 diners bowling alleys and trailer parks chasing the american dream in postwar consumer culture
4028234 st louis milwaukee cleveland these were the real bowling centers in post world war ii society
4028235 the midwest in general and individual working class cities were really the ones that supported the bowling industry
4028236 bowling is something that really resonated with st louisans they could see a lot of their own history in the bowling museum im not sure that can happen in arlington texas
4028237 the program was unable to complete the patch operation please try again later
4028238 having our agm at liliesleaf serves as a reminder to our members who are also subscribers to the mac charter that we as an industry are committed to transformation we chose liliesleaf because of its heritage history and legacy the farm is uniquely connected with the rivonia trial which today represents the essence of the struggle against apartheid

4028241 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
4028242 after the talks the presidents agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries at the ambassadorial level in line with the un charter and the international law
4028243 were one account they send us a bill once a month for all the water we take so they dont have administrative expenses like gwa and we take the bulk of the water from fena lake so there is no distribution costs for the water we take at fena lake
4028244 a year ago they had a 50 increase this year theyre proposing a 17 increase and in the 5 year since the ccu has taken office there has only been 38 increase in water rates
4028245 last night the commission agreed to push these 2 endeavors to have the navy justify and re consider its recent adjustment and to explore the recent options with regard to re visiting the fena ownership issue
4028246 as long as we are here our students are shortchanged more than one academic quarter of instruction and thats a serious concern to us
4028247 both our students and gw students are being shortchanged by our education and thats a concern to us as well as gw because they are also being visited by wasc this year
4028248 the biggest concern is making sure that were able to continue the programs that we identified as part of our action plan last year and that were able to actually advance those programs to meet the goals that we established for ourselves last year

4028252 there are a lot more of us plus sized ladies modeling today compared to twenty or even ten years ago
4028253 only served to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4028254 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4028255 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4028256 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4028257 ever since i can remember ive always been a sucker when it comes to dares

4028259 today i am going to pretend that i am the mistress of darkness and i am going to punish you
4028260 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics
4028261 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the casualties
4028262 by day five of a conflict one expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured but here there is no information nothing

4028265 apart from long distance calls telkom has never decreased its prices its in competition with every voip voice over internet protocol callback and cellular service
4028266 telkom needs to nurture customers so that when real competition enters the market it will be able to hold on to them
4028267 there isnt any competition in the sector thats why telkom has been providing a poor service these increases are not good for small business development especially when you compare them with prices overseas

4028272 i was really surprised i didnt think we would get it back
4028273 were all glad to get it back and we appreciate what the rcmp did to get it back and the man who dropped it off
4028274 my guess is whoever did take it would have heard it on the news somehow and then they put it there hoping someone would see it and pick it up
4028275 i think its very nice of them to do that really
4028276 im here because i love china i mean i love the chinese people
4028277 we want to strike hard and rebuild you have got a million and a half people that are homeless they have got several thousands that lost their lives sowe have to resolve that they have not died in vain
4028278 today russian orthodox churches have uplifted prayers for the victims as on all the previous days eternal memory and repose to warriors peacemakers to all peaceful citizens who perished in the area of conflict
4028279 in the beginning of the 21st century peoples who in spite of all contradictions lived in relative peace suddenly were divided by mass armed struggle
4028280 thank god major war actions are stopped today and theres a new hope for reconciliation
4028281 this war violently divided two nations but most important today is not to return to total violence and observe rules of cease fire the one who will resume scaled operations will take the heaviest responsibility before god and history
4028282 will do everything to give each other a hand of fraternity
4028283 the majority of people at least in russia feel compassion rather than malicious joy and hostility
4028284 today we discuss with christians of europe and the whole world a possibility to extend major humanitarian help to the affected regions of the conflict area including the georgian districts that dont relate to south ossetia there are certain signs that christians of many countries will answer this appeal
4028285 the use of force in the dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilizing a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond
4028286 we encourage churches around the world to support these sister churches and the international ecumenical emergency appeal initiated by action by churches together
4028287 the well being of people who have fled their homes and of those whose homes have been destroyed must be a high priority in the coming days
4028288 military forces to return to positions held before the current violence
4028289 it is fitting that europe gives leadership in making peace
4028290 ensure the territorial integrity and political independence of georgia in accordance with the un charter and by collective action of the un security council
4028291 authorities who resorted to the use of force are to be held accountable for the loss of life they have caused
4028292 were going to entertain kids from the minute they walk in
4028293 as each day passes more of the prominent features are starting to take shape inside the resort and water park in the weeks leading up to our opening expect the work to progress quickly
4028294 weve always anticipated opening mid to the end of october
4028295 right now due to a supply issue on our dehumidification system it looks like it will be about a week or two basically after that
4028296 well be open in november for sure we may end up with a soft opening in october our real goal is to be open by thanksgiving
4028297 obviously were very pleased with the progress were making the project has grown in scope and scale from its original plans were at that point in construction where as we would say you get a big show every day the progress really starts showing now as you start finishing your walls and your hotel and you start putting your granite tops in and so on and so forth all the pool equipment is getting installed everything gets a better definition to it
4028298 we can be open all year unaffected by winter temperatures but we can open it up and enjoy the summer sun
4028299 they have tried to bring in the best of what they found in each and put that all together here for us
4028300 weve got a couple of things were still working on in that area were starting to put in some support staff over the next few weeks we will need food and beverage workers brought on board were still in the interview process with that we have a couple of other departments that we have to work on weve got 10 people right now all management theyre hired and in place we anticipate well be up to about 17 here by the end of september
4028301 to the destination that we have already it does diversify our lodging product it offers different amenities to different customers and also in different price points
4028302 listen very carefully see that tree over there the one with the really tempting fruit dont eat the fruit you kids got that if youre hungry theres plenty of other good stuff around but dont eat that fruit got it
4028303 the soil will be cursed because of you genesis 3 17
4028304 will produce accursed things for you such as flies fleas and ants
4028305 the fly has been endowed by its creator perhaps as a counter balance to its unpopularity with uncanny tenacity
4028306 god in his wisdom made the fly and then forgot to tell us why
4028307 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4028308 our army engineers are ready to help in the rehabilitation efforts including in rebuilding hundreds of houses destroyed and damaged during the conflict
4028309 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4028310 judaism must define what judaism and jews are outside the absurd idea one has to just have a jewish mother
4028311 in other words judaism must separate itself from the left and stop being another form of modern liberalism at least here in america
4028312 in a civilised world not taking the christian way of achieving peace is shocking
4028313 in any conflict in any part of the world there is usually somebody right somebody not quite right and somebody in the middle
4028314 the whole world takes a look at it and comments
4028315 the world europe and of course america sees it differently and of course the best way to resolve these things is by peaceful means
4028316 i dont know what to say i wish it never took place
4028317 theres lots of words we dont hear much in australia happening
4028318 all we know is what we read in the papers
4028319 its a very important territory for them in the transportation of oil
4028320 this conflict has been going on for 16 years and now its involving more and more countries
4028321 the people who are suffering the most are the simple people the people who dont have enough food on the table i hope they stop fighting yesterday not today why the politicians are letting this happen is beyond me
4028322 i think the major reason it happened now is because the focus of the world is on beijing
4028323 both saakashvili and russian prime minister vladimir putin saw this as an opportunity to restore frozen conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia which have been percolating since 1990
4028324 are not georgian they are not connected to georgia either linguistically or culturally
4028325 the cease fire will go forward on russias terms i suspect there will be some kind of settlement giving independent autonomy in abkhazia or south ossetia or both russia is back as a major power

4028343 i believe that this move represents a dangerous precedent of transferring properties in the heart of jerusalem and is in violation of the citys interest since this is not the only property being contested by foreign sources
4028344 it is unclear what the purpose of such a move is how it advances the national interest and strengthens israeli sovereignty in jerusalem and what the government of israel is getting in exchange for such a large and central piece of property in the capital

4028375 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4028376 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them

4028378 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4028379 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4028380 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance

4028461 hunters think that migratory birds have large population sizes and contribute no value to the ecosystem
4028462 hunters think that migratory birds have large populations and contribute no value to the ecosystem thus migratory species are more vulnerable to hunting than local species
4028463 the achievements of the sustainable hunting project will be used as tools to build on in future flyway regional projects in the region
4028464 the project has resulted in a true exchange between the hunters and our association and the two partners have agreed to fight together against poaching and unsustainable hunting
4028465 it is now most important to maintain this exchange to develop the ideas which germinated during the project and to ensure long term awareness raising and training programmes for hunters and the wider public
4028466 the achievements of the sustainable hunting project will be used as tools to build on in future flyway regional projects in the region such as the soaring bird and wings over wetlands projects
4028467 the project has provided a platform at both regional and national levels for continuing to improve the management of bird hunting in the region and to promote more sustainable hunting practices ultimately this leads to a safer migration and a better future for birds using these routes

4028524 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4028525 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4028553 betroffene sind gegen das hochwirksame eiwei gift allergisch und reagieren darauf innerhalb von wenigen minuten mit kreislaufzusammenbr chen und atemnot
4028554 kinder werden h ufig von bienen bzw wespen gestochen weil sie im freien sehr aktiv sind
4028555 menschen die so ein allergie haben bekommen ein so genanntes notfall set das sie immer bei sich tragen sollten es besteht aus einer adrenalinspritze und antihistamin tropfen die sofort nach dem stich eingenommen werden m ssen
4028556 warum auf nach der wahl warten wenn jetzt alle zum handeln bereit sind
4028557 wenn molterer und seine vp ihre vorschl ge ernst meinen verstehe ich nicht warum sie sie nicht gleich umsetzen wollen
4028558 warum nicht gleich n gel mit k pfen machen so wie es werner faymann vorgeschlagen hat
4028559 wenn jetzt die vp draufkommt dass an der alten kinderfreunde forderung was dran ist warum dann nicht gleich die umsetzung angehen
4028560 eine breitere basis f r dieses vorhaben wird auch nach der wahl kaum vorhanden sein jetzt in der stunde der erkenntnis sollte gemeinsam auch die umsetzung angegangen werden
4028561 die zeit dr ngt das n chste kindergartenjahr steht bereits vor der t r
4028562 dass die vp gerne gutes verhindert wissen wir aus den leidvollen erfahrungen der letzten eineinhalb jahre
4028563 dass sie jetzt aber schon ihre eigenen ideen also quasi sich selbst verhindern will ist selbst in der geschichte der sterreichischen verhinderer partei ein novum und starker tobak
4028564 entweder nimmt molterer seinen vorschlag ernst dann sollte er jetzt mit uns die umsetzung angehen
4028565 ansonsten war es wohl doch nur ein leeres wahlversprechen bei dem es ihm nicht um die rasche hilfe f r die familien sondern nur um stimmenfang f r die vp ging
4028566 der film rekonstruiert auf basis j ngster forschungsergebnisse das dramatische geschehen in der damaligen tschechoslowakei mittels spielszenen interviews und archivmaterial schwerpunkte sind die beziehung der beiden hauptakteure breschnew und dubcek sowie die rolle der republik sterreich
4028567 dass der ffentlichen f rdert tigkeit bei der realisierung sterreichischer filmprojekte mit l nder bergreifenden themen eine ganz besondere bedeutung zukommt belegen die zahlen im fall der dokumentation prager fr hling wurden mehr als 40 eur 342 550 der gesamtherstellungskosten eur 823 440 von ffentlichen f rderinstitutionen getragen 20 vom fernsehfonds austria 15 5 vom filmfonds wien und 6 1 vom land nieder sterreich
4028568 auch die im ministerrat am dienstag erreichte erh hung des pflegegeldes hat gezeigt wie es eigentlich schon viel fr her h tte gehen k nnen und m ssen es ist sch n dass die vp nun endlich aufgewacht ist und mit ihr der beschluss dieser wichtigen ma nahme f r die familien m glich geworden ist
4028569 familienfreundliche politik darf kein leeres schlagwort sein gerade in zeiten exorbitant hoher teuerung brauchen familien mit kindern rasche hilfe die auch wirkt
4028570 wenn sie wirklich will dann kann die vp diese ma nahme noch im september mit der sp beschlie en
4028571 die sp hat bereits bewiesen dass sie auch w hrend eines wahlkampfs f r die sterreicherinnen konstruktive l sungen erarbeiten kann auch f r wirksame verbesserungen hinsichtlich der hohen teuerung und die kassensanierung betreffendes w re die sozialdemokratie sofort f r vern nftige l sungen zu haben
4028572 ich m chte die vp noch einmal ausdr cklich dazu ermutigen sich weiter beim wahlkampfget se zur ckzunehmen und ber ihren eigenen schatten zu springen damit noch vor den wahlen gemeinsam mit der sp weiteren sinnvollen l sungen f r die menschen umgesetzt werden k nnen
4028573 ich w rde meine br ste unter den armen tragen
4028574 after a successful closure to the past year we have got off to a very satisfactory start in the new fiscal year our new strategic orientation is achieving excellent results
4028575 on the agenda now is to do the investing needed for the future of the company and to press ahead with our strategy of growing licensings share in overall sales so consistently raising our profit levels long term we are confident that we will go on achieving our goals in the future as well
4028576 es ist nicht gerecht wenn man mehr als 2 150 euro verdienen muss um bei einem jobverlust nicht unter die armutsschwelle zu rutschen vor allem weil hier auch besonders junge menschen frauen und migrantinnen betroffen sind
4028577 wenn breite bev lkerungsgruppen mit ihrem derzeitigen arbeitslosengeld in die armutsgef hrdung rutschen m ssen wir dringend ber eine erh hung diskutieren denn 55 des letzteinkommens sind dann offensichtlich zu wenig
4028578 nach dem erfolgreichen jahresabschluss haben wir nun einen guten start ins neue gesch ftsjahr vollzogen und durch unsere neue strategische ausrichtung ein herausragendes ergebnis erzielt
4028579 nun gilt es die f r die zukunft des unternehmens notwendigen investitionen zu t tigen und die strategische ausrichtung auf die steigerung des lizenzanteils am umsatz und damit die steigerung der profitabilit t langfristig konsequent voranzutreiben wir sind zuversichtlich unsere ziele auch zuk nftig weiterhin zu erreichen

4028592 it is impossible to go back there my home that i built myself does not exist now
4028593 even if the war stops the atrocities and the russians will stay there they only call themselves peacekeepers but in reality they are aggressors
4028594 i did not want to leave my village at all i travelled 90 kilometres by foot sleeping rough with my wife son and grandson it is terrifying to see what was happening there
4028595 if there was a guarantee that the land is ours i would go back on foot even at night but if the peacekeepers stay there i am afraid for the life of my grandchildren
4028596 how is it possible to escape bombs bombs do not spare neither old nor young
4028597 i will only go home if there is no war and if the land is georgian i will only go back in that case i want to live with georgians i do not want to live with ossetians
4028598 i will go back home of course if there is a chance of that but how can i do that
4028599 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4028600 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4028601 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4028602 our army engineers are ready to help in the rehabilitation efforts including in rebuilding hundreds of houses destroyed and damaged during the conflict
4028603 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4028604 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4028605 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed

4028612 e very time i look at you the world just melts away all my troubles all my fears dissolve in your affections youve seen me at my weakest but you take me as i am and when i fall you offer me a softer place to land you stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together youre the one true thing i know i can believe in youre all the things that i desire you save me you complete me youre the one true thing i know i can believe i get mad so easy but you give me room to breathe no matter what i say or do cause youre too good to fight about it even when i have to push just to see how far youll go you wont stoop down to battle but you never turn to go there are times i cant decide when i cant tell up from down you make me feel less crazy when otherwise id drown but you pick me up amp brush me off and tell me im ok sometimes thats just what we need to get us through the day

4028620 i wish you were here with me i dont want you to be me or to sit here in my place i want you to sit beside me and see everything i see but i want you to see it differently and i want you to tell me what you see i want you to hold it out in front of me and let me touch it you said we wouldnt talk because your lips would be pressed against mine at the same time in different places if we kiss is it the same if we both think of it at the same time and close our eyes and move our lips can we kiss so far away is it love with the spaces between all the miles pushing out and the voices pulling in if we believe the distance over time will bring us together give us a greater velocity i wish you were here
4028621 bagi kami di komisi i dpr diundangnya anggota parlemen myanmar dalam acara kenegaraan itu untuk memberikan dukungan moril terhadap upaya upaya pembangunan demokrasi oleh rakyat di negara negara sahabat terutama di kawasan asean

4028637 children are losing their benefits under this punitive policy change
4028638 clearly the children who are most negatively impacted are children who have the most serious health care needs
4028639 improving health and promoting healthy behaviors are laudable goals but restricting health care coverage for infants and children is not the way to achieve them

4028647 add homelessness mental illness or drug addiction into the mix and taking much needed medication falls from the top of the priority list
4028648 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
4028649 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
4028650 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
4028651 creating a sort of double jeopardy for companies first having to run the fda approval maze then allowing a nationwide quilt of different laws and standards to second guess that approval
4028652 far from representing a radical departure in the law the courts reasoning upheld what had become a common opinion in the federal court system
4028653 reigel only applied to products in the strictest fda tranche known as premarket approval products which represent 1 to 2 of the overall medical device market
4028654 those who believe theyve been injured by medical devices can still sue for a poorly manufactured product or they can attempt to show that the fda didnt get all the necessary information when the device was approved
4028655 what mr waxman really wants to restore is the trial lawyer bingo that can net jackpot jury awards while wreaking havoc on national standards
4028656 democrats want tort lawyers and juries of lawmen to be the ultimate arbiters of new devices then they should do away with the fda entirely and go to an underwriters laboratory system that gets devices to patients more rapidly
4028657 they want it both ways agonizingly slow device approvals and open tort season after the fact
4028658 if congress really wants to improve the quality of medical products for consumers it would better spend its energy on reforming the bureaucratic morass that is the fda

4028662 contributing to the shortage is that too few medical students choose primary care
4028663 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy

4028671 the risks associated with stilnox and other hypnotics generally outweigh any benefits they provide with continuous long term use
4028672 there is no convincing evidence that the benefit harm profile of zolpidem or zopiclone is more favourable than that of short acting benzodiazepines such as temazepam
4028673 tolerance dependence and morning sedation have also been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone
4028674 the difficulty with any pill not just stilnox is that the risk of dependency is related to the fact that stopping them abruptly can lead to rebound sleep problems meaning the sleep can be worse than it was in the first place because your body has got used to the pill
4028675 the problem is that with our lifestyles western society expects a quick fix
4028676 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
4028677 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
4028678 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
4028679 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
4028680 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
4028681 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
4028682 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
4028683 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
4028684 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems

4028704 weve been doing it for almost two years now but the success of it has only just recently started to boom with the credit crunch setting in
4028705 people need to find different ways to go out and this helps
4028706 its also great for us because we get produce at a good price although we have high standards so the food we get in has to meet those
4028707 we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers
4028708 when we get the good stuff and it gets on to the specials board its brilliant
4028709 someone will say that rabbit tasted great and we say here meet the person who shot it

4028711 i have a job where i earn the national minimum wage so this little bit of extra money helps me get out
4028712 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4028713 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4028714 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4028715 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4028716 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows
4028717 i have to weigh up if its all worth it

4028719 ill be concerned about him if he decides to play thats for sure
4028720 i think it says a lot about the character of the fellow that hes even thinking about playing
4028721 he knows things arent going to change too much with his arm in one week and hes basically putting his arm on the line for his team
4028722 you have to know the type of guy he is
4028723 some guys who arent team orientated it doesnt affect that much but hes a guy who is totally all about his teammates

4028727 at the margin they are factors that have helped keep the bond market reasonably well supported
4028728 if we get numbers as expected i would think that would be supportive of the bond market overnight unless for example we see equities roaring back

4028730 genau das erwarte ich auch von den f rdermitgliedern der speed academy sie m ssen nicht nur auf sondern auch neben der strecke immer topleistungen bringen
4028731 kai sie sind jurymitglied der speed academy und begr nden ihr engagement mit dem satz weil es mich interessiert wer der nachfolger von michael schumacher wird wie realistisch ist es dass die speed academy f ndig wird
4028732 die speed academy ist doch l ngst f ndig geworden timo glock hat nicht erst mit seinem zweiten platz beim gro en preis von ungarn bewiesen dass er in der k nigsklasse angekommen ist auch bei adrian sutil und nico h lkenberg zeigt der karrierepfeil deutlich nach oben
4028733 h tte es michael schumacher heute schwerer als anfang der 90er jahre solch eine karriere zu starten oder h tte er es mit dem engagement der speed academy eventuell sogar leichter
4028734 ein gutes pferd dr ngt sich immer an die krippe ich bin davon berzeugt dass sich absolute ausnahmetalente immer und zu jeder zeit durchsetzen werden um ein juwel wie schumi zu werden m ssen auch die rohdiamanten des deutschen motorsports an der einen oder anderen stelle noch poliert werden die speed academy sorgt f r rundum bildung und hilft dass auch medien sponsoren und rennteams das talent leichter erkennen
4028735 was muss denn ein top mann im motorsport heute alles k nnen
4028736 ein rennfahrer muss zun chst einmal schnell sein daran hat sich seit den zeiten von rosemeyer und caracciola nichts ge ndert und er braucht ein gesp r f r das auto und die technik talent ist extrem wichtig aber das erweitern der eigenen m glichkeiten durch gezielte arbeit ebenso also muss der pilot permanent sein fahrerisches k nnen und die k rperliche fitness verbessern genauso muss der sportler seine au endarstellung im griff haben und sich selbst optimal vermarkten denn der fahrer steht im zentrum eines fragilen gebildes welches das eigene team die medien und sponsoren umfasst wenn sich ein sportler ein m glichst positives profil erarbeitet wird dies seinen marktwert zus tzlich erh hen
4028737 sie haben mit allen gro en fahrern der formel 1 gesprochen die meisten davon sind echte typen mit hohem wiedererkennungswert sind erfolgreiche marken wie schafft es ein nachwuchspilot eigenst ndig zu werden
4028738 durch flei und kontinuierliche arbeit an sich und seiner au enwirkung bei der speed academy lernen die jungen fahrer auf was sie dabei achten m ssen das f ngt bei der kleidung und der frisur an und h rt beim richtigen verhalten vor mikrofon und fernsehkamera noch nicht auf wichtig ist dass der fahrer positiv und unverwechselbar r berkommt
4028739 was bringt die speed academy den fahrern ihrer meinung nach
4028740 die speed academy bietet den fahrern die m glichkeit sich unter realistischen bedingungen und mit hilfe kompetenter
4028741 ich bin ja kein rennfahrer und kann den jungs also nicht beibringen wie sie noch schneller werden was ich vermittle ist direkt aus meiner erfahrung im umgang mit fahrern und machern in der formel 1 abgeleitet der nachwuchs muss sich darauf vorbereiten auch unter stress im fernsehen optimal r berzukommen und nat rlich lernt er von mir auch sich auf reporter vorzubereiten die nicht nur die standardfragen abrufen fingerspitzengef hl f r die situation und das gegen ber spontaneit t und eigenst ndigkeit m ssen auch in extremsituationen funktionieren
4028742 wie lang ist denn die strecke eines hoffnungsvollen talents bis in die k nigsklasse und wie ist man dort erfolgreich
4028743 die frage ist schwer zu beantworten denn es kommt auf den einzelnen fahrer an mancher schafft den sprung fr her marschiert im eiltempo durch die unteren klassen andere m ssen auch mal r ckschl ge berwinden
4028744 man sagt ja dass lehrjahre keine herrenjahre sind m ssen sich nachwuchsfahrer in der ffentlichkeit anders verhalten als gestandene profis
4028745 generell sollte man immer versuchen sich ehrlich und authentisch zu verhalten nat rlich darf man dabei niemals die allgemein g ltigen benimmregeln au er acht lassen
4028746 bei ihren boxen reportagen wollen sie von den fahrern immer m glichst viele details erfahren k nnen sie dem nachwuchs das richtige n he distanz verh ltnis beibringen wie machen sie das
4028747 das geht nur mit individuellem auf den einzelnen fahrer zugeschnittenem training denn jeder pilot ist anders manche lieben die n he manche suchen eher die distanz jeder muss f r sich die richtige alltagstaugliche mischung finden und genau diese versuche ich mit den fahrern herauszuarbeiten
4028748 rennfahrer m ssen im auto egoisten und im umfeld teamplayer sein
4028749 sie kennen sie alle und k nnen uns diese frage sicher beantworten was f r menschen sind motorsportler eigentlich und welche charaktereigenschaften brauchen sie um sich durchzusetzen
4028750 sie sind alle hoch professionell verf gen ber ein hohes technisches know how und sind au ergew hnlich ehrgeizig rennfahrer m ssen im auto egoisten und im umfeld teamplayer sein nur so ist erfolg dauerhaft m glich
4028751 von erfolgreichen boxern kann man optimales zweikampfverhalten also durchsetzungsverm gen lernen das hei t auch dass man in aussichtslosen situationen nie aufgibt wer vom letzten startplatz aus starten muss muss den willen haben sich position f r position zu verbessern
4028752 mal ehrlich herr ebel w rden sie selbst gern in einem formel 1 cockpit sitzen
4028753 um gottes willen nein ich mache lieber das was ich kann
4028754 its terribly sad but another example of how communication or a lack of communication can get in the way
4028755 when i heard about it i was really unhappy and distressed now i understand how it happened anger is counter productive
4028756 i dont want to off side the ranger and the council i dont want to make enemies of these people there is no point shit happens sometimes weve all been there
4028757 it was taken down by graffiti removal people its not their brief to make sure they are careful they were just doing their job
4028758 those designers who have the stomach to go again will do theirs again i assume they may not go back because its very labour intensive
4028759 i was annoyed and frustrated because it was a joy to see this work in the street at it was terrible the way these designers were treated
4028760 late yesterday morning we located human remains that we believe are the human remains of leeanne mintern
4028761 she was located in a shallow grave forensic police are there at the moment gathering evidence and retrieving those remains
4028762 were quietly confident that it is her but we have to have a formal identification which may have to be done through dna
4028763 obviously her family were quite upset they were hoping that she would be alive somewhere
4028764 as soon as you hear the word lottery everyone assumes that it was financially motivated
4028765 i think we fell into that trap in the last month and it has cost us worrying about opposition teams results
4028766 weve gotten away from our own focus of winning games of football and started looking behind our back a bit
4028767 we looked ahead too and we cant do that any more because theres no bigger game than geelong
4028768 if you start looking ahead against a team like geelong youve got a problem
4028769 last time we played them we stuck with them for three quarters and then gary ablett blew us away in the last quarter
4028770 it does give you confidence to know you can go with them
4028771 last week fremantle was a game where we just wanted to get the win and get our confidence up to give us that momentum going into this week so we could play like we did against geelong earlier in the season
4028772 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
4028773 if you are not 100 per cent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can
4028774 the win two weeks ago was satisfying but its easy to do one its about being able to back that performance up and thats what were trying to do
4028775 how a backrower operates comes off what happens in front of you
4028776 the last match was a great indicator of that the front five got stuck in and made our jobs a lot easier
4028777 he adds a lot of energy there and in the physical side of things he is always in amongst it
4028778 how effective you are depends on whether you get front foot ball or not i know certainly when you dont have front foot ball he can be a real menace
4028779 but for this all black team we want to make sure every time we go into a tri nations or any test we perform as well as we can and hopefully get the results were after
4028780 for the canadian national team to qualify for the quarter final is a huge accomplishment
4028781 we knew before the hearty up that we had qualified so we were pleased about that i told the players to stay focused on the game which they did it was our third strong performance in a row
4028782 universal is not a small mom and pop store and for them to say we believe in jin we believe in this album we want to support it throw money into it that right there to me is almost like i havent won the war but thats one battle won already
4028783 you get older your thought process changes your views on whats important to you changes and the way i almost look at my career now is im rolling with the punches as well as just maximizing on whatever opportunities are in front of me
4028784 indeed our players are far behind the brazilians in terms of
4028785 we try to give them the rules and few basic
4028786 chillax man ill import all your photos just drag em see easy no macs dont crash
4028787 when revue noir stopped performing in 2005 there were only five songs that we released
4028788 while we both continued on with our own music finishing up a revue noir album remained on my to do list at the end of 2007 i went back into the computer and found we had a lot of material laid down for rehearsing songs for live shows there were bits recorded in my studio or mp3s nicki sent me to rehearse to in looking through all of that i realized we did have the material for the album all that was required was adding the touches to finish it up
4028789 this man hes been talking absolutely rubbish he makes up stories
4028790 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step
4028791 israel is acting dishonestly palestinians are under dictatorship oppression for the last 60 years
4028792 condemning this regretful position we deputies ask dr ahmadinejad to deal with him seriously
4028793 mr mashaie probably does not know that those he calls people israelis are the same occupiers of houses of millions of palestinians
4028794 these people have created the illegitimate zionist regime we do not recognise a land called israel let alone recognise its people
4028795 no one knew who the players were or what the rules were but hockey has a way of hooking fans and that happened
4028796 may have is not within south africas control its a problem south africa is spending a lot of time energy and resources trying to resolve
4028797 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
4028798 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
4028799 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
4028800 because of the failed policies of zanu pf five million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
4028801 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4028802 there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
4028803 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4028804 in response to this challenge health minister manto tshabalala msimang assembled a team of surgeons from two public hospitals in cape town to assist namibia to set up the cardiac unit the first in the country and the third in the african continent after south africa and egypt
4028805 the most gratifying aspect of the project is the quality of life that will now be enjoyed by these people who otherwise would have experienced heart failure and generally a poor quality of health
4028806 it is envisaged that this cardiac unit will one day be able to assist not only patients in namibia but from the rest of the continent

4028814 i was wrongly excluded from participating in the zimbabwe presidential elections
4028815 the probability of suffering irreparable loss as a result of the settlement negotiations being conducted renders this application urgent
4028816 i fear that by that time the settlement negotiations would have been long concluded and a new president prime minister chosen and inaugurated
4028817 the thai general cargo ship was hijacked in the gulf of aden on august 12 by somali pirates
4028818 in view of the crew safety we are unable to provide further details
4028819 we hope the un and the coalition forces will stop the attacks unless there is a deterrent the attacks and hijacking will continue to escalate

4028835 like a clockwork mouse on rails rattling back and forth
4028836 on some of the islands in the thousand islands area there are established black legged tick populations and those populations have the bacteria that cause lyme disease
4028837 people are certainly coming into contact at a much higher rate than they have in the past
4028838 i would expect over time as the tick populations become more established in those areas the infection rate will climb and the risk will increase
4028839 the attitude of the health authorities is baffling to say the least
4028840 a couple of days later the same doctor called her back because he read a newspaper article about lyme disease and said were going to test you after all
4028841 most recently weve been watching whats been going on in the st lawrence thousand islands national park area
4028842 weve been seeing an increase in tick submissions because the people are more aware
4028843 the positive rate for lyme disease for those ticks hasnt gone up substantially but that doesnt mean were going to be complacent about it
4028844 prevention includes such as things as wearing long clothing checking oneself for ticks if one doesnt though they are very tiny and hard to see
4028845 the prevention we can give is to wear long trousers when one is in long grass and in the country where these ticks like to live
4028846 were not as likely to run into this tick as much as we are likely to run into mosquitoes
4028847 public health in general tended to focus on that because the mosquito exposure is so much more common
4028848 however that is not to take away from the importance of lyme disease
4028849 this is not a disease we see every day although i have heard that ticks are becoming more common
4028850 if we do run into a situation where this becomes a great risk and were observing more transmission to humans there would be more reason to do more intensive public awareness
4028851 the thing thats different is that the climate is changing its warming gradually so our summers are getting warmer and our falls are becoming warmer
4028852 the temperatures stay higher for longer throughout the year and thats making southern canada receptive for the blacklegged tick
4028853 loyalty behaviours including relationship continuance increased scale or scope of relationship and recommendation word of mouth advertising result from customers beliefs that the quantity of value received from one supplier is greater than that available from other suppliers
4028854 loyalty in one or more of the forms noted above creates increased profit through enhanced revenues reduced costs to acquire customers lower customer price sensitivity and decreased costs to serve customers familiar with a firms service delivery system
4028855 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave

4028857 we recognise the sovereignty of georgia but territorial integrity its another matter

4028885 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood

4028888 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4028889 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4028890 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4028891 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4028892 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4028893 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4028894 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4028895 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4028896 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4028897 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4028898 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4028899 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4028900 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4028901 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4028902 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4028903 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4028904 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4028905 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4028906 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4028907 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
4028908 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4028909 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4028910 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4028911 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4028912 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4028913 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4028914 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4028915 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4028916 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4028917 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4028918 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4028919 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4028920 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4028921 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4028922 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4028923 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4028924 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4028925 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4028926 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4028927 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4028928 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4028929 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4028930 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4028931 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
4028932 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
4028933 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4028934 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4028935 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
4028936 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
4028937 yeah bomb the mess out of them take em over
4028938 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4028939 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4028940 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4028941 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4028942 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4028943 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4028944 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president

4028963 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4028964 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4028965 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4028966 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4028967 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
4028968 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
4028969 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4028970 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how as usual the american press is telling us who the vice president will be amp who to vote for in the up coming election
4028971 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4028972 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4028973 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4028974 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4028975 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4028976 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4028977 going negative against democrat barack obama isnt just a campaign strategy for republican john mccain
4028978 top the aug 17 new york times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list
4028979 lashes out at barack obama and alleges among other things that the politician has a secret radical islamic agenda
4028980 whether they like him or oppose him readers want to hear more about barack obama
4028981 the author of the million selling dreams from my father and the audacity of hope
4028982 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4028983 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4028984 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4028985 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4028986 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4028987 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4028988 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4028989 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4028990 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4028991 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4028992 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4028993 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4028994 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4028995 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4028996 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4028997 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4028998 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4028999 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4029000 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4029001 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4029002 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4029003 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4029004 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4029005 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
4029006 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
4029007 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4029008 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
4029009 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
4029010 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
4029011 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
4029012 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
4029013 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4029014 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
4029015 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
4029016 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4029017 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
4029018 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4029019 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4029020 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4029021 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4029022 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4029023 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4029024 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4029025 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4029026 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4029027 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4029028 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
4029029 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4029030 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4029031 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4029032 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4029033 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4029034 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4029035 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4029036 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4029037 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4029038 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4029039 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4029040 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4029041 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
4029042 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
4029043 real results by the end of my first term in office
4029044 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
4029045 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
4029046 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4029047 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4029048 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4029049 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4029050 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4029051 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4029052 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4029053 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4029054 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4029055 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4029056 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4029057 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4029058 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4029059 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4029060 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4029061 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4029062 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4029063 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4029064 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
4029065 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
4029066 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
4029067 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4029068 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4029069 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4029070 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4029071 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4029072 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4029073 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4029074 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4029075 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4029076 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4029077 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4029078 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4029079 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4029080 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4029081 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4029082 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4029083 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4029084 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4029085 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4029086 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4029087 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4029088 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4029089 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4029090 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4029091 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4029092 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4029093 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4029094 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4029095 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4029096 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4029097 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4029098 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
4029099 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
4029100 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
4029101 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
4029102 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
4029103 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
4029104 the political brain the role of emotion in deciding the fate of the nation
4029105 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4029106 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4029107 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4029108 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
4029109 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
4029110 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
4029111 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
4029112 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
4029113 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
4029114 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
4029115 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
4029116 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
4029117 i am proud to have helped found the tahoe summit and the health of lake tahoe and its surrounding areas is hugely important to me
4029118 we have accomplished a lot in the past 11 years but we need to continue work on lake clarity and restoration and implementing the environmental improvement program so we can all enjoy lake tahoe for years to come my thanks to all the parties coming to the table to discuss where we are and where we need to go for the future of the lake
4029119 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4029120 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4029121 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4029122 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4029123 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4029124 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4029125 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4029126 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4029127 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4029128 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4029129 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4029130 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4029131 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4029132 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4029133 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4029134 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4029135 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4029136 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4029137 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4029138 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4029139 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4029140 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4029141 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4029142 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4029143 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4029144 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4029145 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4029146 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4029147 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4029148 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4029149 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4029150 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4029151 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4029152 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4029153 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4029154 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4029155 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4029156 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4029157 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4029158 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4029159 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4029160 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4029161 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4029162 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4029163 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4029164 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4029165 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4029166 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4029167 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4029168 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4029169 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4029170 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4029171 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4029172 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4029173 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4029174 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4029175 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4029176 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4029177 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4029178 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4029179 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4029180 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4029181 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4029182 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
4029183 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4029184 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4029185 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4029186 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4029187 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4029188 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4029189 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4029190 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4029191 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4029192 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4029193 different local issues like acute gas and power crises and waterlogging prevailing in the port city featured in the meeting where we have tried to give some immediate and short term solutions to the problems
4029194 additional gas will be supplied to the industrial units that could not go into operation for want of gas
4029195 as a short term solution to power crisis we have decided to set up a furnace oil run rental power plant
4029196 though we know it will be a bit expensive we have to look for an alternative way of producing power as an instant solution
4029197 talks with board of investment boi and others concerned are going on
4029198 since its a huge project all the details need to be discussed thoroughly
4029199 besides we will hold talks with the italian ambassador for reviving and immediate implementation of madunaghat water treatment plant to resolve the water crisis in the port city
4029200 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4029201 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4029202 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4029203 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4029204 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4029205 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4029206 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4029207 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4029208 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4029209 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4029210 jeg er fortaler for at sas umiddelbart n rmer sig lufthansa mens man stadig har et produkt der kan s lges og et varem rke som har en v rdi

4029219 i know i heard im not mad i can take a joke
4029220 the bills requirement that all children under 16 years of age when operating an atv on public lands possess an atv safety certificate could result in about 4 000 additional children requesting free atv training each year
4029221 after every holiday weekend i read stories of atv accidents at oceano dunes and other recreation sites
4029222 it is impossible to replace experience especially for 20 teachers

4029224 and we are confident that each student in our district will get the quality instruction our community parents and students have come to expect
4029225 we keep saying to each other this wasnt the year i was going to go
4029226 a rushed and premature return process would have disastrous consequences both for the displaced and for the stability of iraq
4029227 violence is still widespread and basic services such as access to healthcare clean water or adequate shelter are unavailable in many parts of the country
4029228 since last year weve managed to achieve remarkable security gains this should help iraqi displaced families and refugees to return to their homes and lead normal lives
4029229 i ran out of money to feed my family and meet their needs and it was hard to find decent work there because of my legal status and that is why we came to the conclusion that it would be better to return to iraq despite the fragile security here
4029230 until conditions are met for a voluntary safe and sustainable return process
4029231 at the margin they are factors that have helped keep the bond market reasonably well supported
4029232 if we get numbers as expected i would think that would be supportive of the bond market overnight unless for example we see equities roaring back
4029233 as long as this cpi number is no worse than expected then i think that will bolster the view that the fed doesnt need to be in any rush to think about tightening policy
4029234 the mining stocks rallied though after stronger base metals prices overnight
4029235 they were ambushed by insurgents hours before they opened fire on the bus the bodies of five civilians killed in the incident were brought to wanlaweyn

4029250 the federal trade commission is committed to exercising its authority to determine whether crude oil gasoline or petroleum distillates price increases at wholesale are a result of illegal market manipulation

4029315 if im able to get the third inning before doumit hit the double and were still a 2 1 ballgame but i wasnt able to finish off the inning
4029316 those walks in the fifth by fogg is what set it up for the big boys to come up in the fifth
4029317 we know fogg is going to give you six or six and a fraction

4029325 within the mtv networks north region we are aiming to improve our channel presentation by managing content directly and more efficiently from the desktop

4029328 in terms of solutions architecture the system we have devised in conjunction with mtvns engineering and operations teams is the closest we have come yet to a truly file based workflow
4029329 there is no baseband video cabling and no dedicated ingest server content arriving on tape is ingested directly by mediator to an isilon iq central storage system as mxf files from a sony flexicart or from individual sony e vtrs using the e vtr network port overcomes the need to digitise files via sdi during ingest increasingly however material is delivered to mediator as files without any tape for mtv networks north channels mediator is driven by the mediagenix schedule and delivers a flexible workflow to complete all tasks in the right order for transmission priority

4029377 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration

4029379 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4029380 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4029381 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4029382 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it

4029388 matter remains outstanding and because of its criticality and significance docep recommends that this matter be brought formally to apache executive management attention
4029389 the serious question that has to be asked is if energy minister fran logans department had followed the technical advice they were given would the explosion have occurred at all if fran logan had done his job properly is it the case that we wouldnt have had the explosion on varanus island and we wouldnt have incurred multi billion dollars of cost to the west australian economy

4029392 st louis milwaukee cleveland these were the real bowling centers in post world war ii society
4029393 the midwest in general and individual working class cities were really the ones that supported the bowling industry
4029394 we understand they are considering a work to rule rather than full industrial action
4029395 they need to focus on the product more they need to take their eyes off the share price and concentrate on profits concentrate on improving ad sales and not make all these savings to keep share price inflated

4029397 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4029398 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4029399 but there are a few people who have come here to peak to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4029400 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4029401 we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas
4029402 manifest failure of the chinese government to keep their promises
4029403 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4029404 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4029405 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4029406 are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4029407 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area
4029408 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that he said
4029409 i think the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better what china is about
4029410 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4029411 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4029412 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4029413 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4029414 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4029415 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4029416 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4029417 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4029418 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4029419 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4029420 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4029421 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4029422 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4029423 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4029424 our belief in tolerance and liberty our commitment to fairness fair play and civic duty
4029425 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
4029426 we are concerned that drink does play a part in a number of these situations
4029427 people from all the countries weve looked at have increased levels of alcohol use when theyre traveling abroad theyre treating every night like a friday or saturday night the reality unfortunately is that the levels of drunkenness among britons are higher and thats led to some of the alcohol related problems were familiar with
4029428 one of the biggest challenges in this concept was designing it in such a way to be beautiful attractive and harmonic in both its two shapes
4029429 podcasting as a new media platform emerged about four years ago in 2006 primedia broadcasting introduced several podcasts for listeners to download beginning with the comedy features broadcast during 94 7 highveld stereos rude awakening breakfast show listeners love this content on air so its not surprising that demand for these podcasts has rocketed over the past two years
4029430 some features like whackheads window on the world for example have recorded more downloads in the first six months of this year alone than they have collectively in the past two years and these are just the figures for the actual downloads our research shows that many of these podcasts are passed on to friends a number we cant even quantify at this point
4029431 it would be great to quantify just how many people have enjoyed this content worldwide but unfortunately the nature of web 2 0 content sites and social networks makes this impossible weve observed statistics as high as 800 000 for one of whackheads clips on youtube alone and dont claim these in our official figures
4029432 the initial fears that these platforms would threaten radio have not materialised instead they are offering us great ways to interact with our listeners these statistics bear testimony to the quality of the content were offering weve worked hard to ensure that we dont limit ourselves to podcasting per se but to downloads of files on the web and most importantly to the mobile phone we use the term podcast to refer to these collectively
4029433 this is not a get rich quick scheme but a get rich slow program
4029434 thank you so much for this teachings teacher this is a path of liberation
4029435 listen all and go where you want but be careful so you dont get trap in the nets
4029436 it is not about luck that we have reached the last eight in fact all the teams that have reached this stage did so because they worked hard from the first game at this stage anything can happen no one is favourite or underdog
4029437 their presence in the team makes a lot of difference because even if they are not playing other strikers know that they cannot rest on their laurels because there is competition they have made competition for places in the team more stiff and this can only help the whole team improve
4029438 we are still focused on the coca cola cup but we have to look at the bigger picture it is good that we are still in there and we are going to try to stay even longer because it would help us start the league in good shape

4029456 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are almost hateful we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes

4029465 our customers continue to place enormous value of their holidays and we are seeing no evidence to suggest that demand is slowing for any of our seasons on sale
4029466 in addition we are currently recovering input cost inflation for all open seasons
4029467 bearing in mind market conditions and the fact that the cancellation rate increased to unprecedented levels towards the end of the financial year we consider this to be a satisfactory performance

4029474 i signed my new contract today so personally i am very happy i hope i made the fans happy too ive had seven great seasons this will be my eighth and i hope to have many more
4029475 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and this was one of them it does become frustrating when you see things written some untrue some slightly true we can now put it all to bed and focus on the football
4029476 this is a great day for the club for frank and for english football frank is committed and he agreed and signed a five year contract
4029477 this will kill all the speculation thats been going on for far too long 18 months not just this summer and it allows the club and frank to focus on whats important which is next season
4029478 obviously mine and my familys world got turned upside down it was very tough
4029479 now i feel for sure 100 ive made the right decision
4029480 ill always hold jos mourinho in very high regard but personally i hold chelsea football club in very high regard
4029481 a transfer i didnt speak to jos about it its something that shouldnt be done ive got a relationship with jose where weve had certain contacts afterwards which is normal
4029482 it seems that he likes me as a player but i dont think hed ever go down that route talking without permission i wouldnt really appreciate it and i dont think hed go down that line
4029483 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4029484 if fire should move in naturally were comfortable with that
4029485 but if you bring a drip torch into the vatican and intend to ignite it you are going to have some opposition
4029486 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4029487 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day

4029491 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally
4029492 in the end all of us in public life will be judged by history and im no different from anybody else
4029493 you havent changed nice to see you all i wouldnt want you to change you were so loveable in your old form
4029494 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4029495 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4029496 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4029497 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4029498 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4029499 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4029500 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4029501 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let

4029505 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled
4029506 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4029507 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4029508 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4029509 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot

4029537 there is no passing custom as people only pass along the other side now breakfast used to be our busiest time but this morning we only had five customers before 11am
4029538 i am afraid my customers may not come back now as they may have found somehere else to eat
4029539 we really might have to close i am under a lot of pressure and feeling very stressed i have had to lose staff because i couldnt afford to pay them
4029540 i am a regular at the caf and have been coming here for a while and i have really noticed a difference in the amount of customers coming in its such a shame
4029541 we have lost thousands and thousands of pounds since the work started
4029542 the national grid has promised that work is due to finish soon so hopefully we will get all of our old customers back
4029543 they have also assured us that we will be compensated for any loss of business but that is not much use and comes too late as we have struggled to get by so compensation would have been better before or during the building work
4029544 inevitably during a project of this scale there will be disruption as essential works are carried out but i am working closely with the developer and rochdale borough council to minimise these
4029545 the improvements will benefit nearby businesses and residents and as part of the major redevelopment of the town centre put middleton in a much stronger long term position the result of this development will be a much more attractive new environment
4029546 i have instructed the council that we will fight this decision
4029547 i have also submitted a formal complaint and this news will be devastating for the people of middleton
4029548 we will fight tooth and nail to retain this valuable community facility
4029549 we want to know why residents werent informed and given the chance to oppose it in the first place
4029550 weve been here for 36 years but its not been the easiest place to live in the middle of a chemical plant
4029551 i ended up going to see a specialist in manchester who said the rash was a form of reaction or allergy
4029552 weve had to go through months of upheaval with the building work its an absolute mess round here its affected my business and now they are working closer to the back of my pub
4029553 weve had years of misery and now theyre building there again that was a chemical site and i was always told you could never build on there
4029554 but you cant fight the big companies and you cant fight the council so what can you do
4029555 we are already acting for an ex ici blackley employee who has contracted bladder cancer and who worked at the plant from 1955 to 1980 we are keen to speak to people who worked at the same location from the 1950s through to the 1980s in order to establish what chemicals were used where and how
4029556 we have had contact with a number of witnesses and have been made aware that a significant number of people who worked at the site have subsequently died of bladder cancer
4029557 we know that there is a history of people exposed to chemicals developing cancers and in addition we are concerned that there may still be contaminated areas around the site which was bought by harrow estates in 2004
4029558 the scale of this investment provides a rare opportunity to create a learning environment that will benefit current and future generations exciting and challenging times lie ahead and over the coming months we will be engaging staff students parents future students schools and the local community to ensure the outcome is the best possible fit for everyone we also aim to maximise the community benefit during the construction phase by inviting local subcontractors to tender work packages and provide employment opportunities for new entrants and skilled workers wherever possible
4029559 im both nervous and excited at the moment the audition was great it went really well i just went in there and sang they sent me out and a few minutes later they told me i was through
4029560 before and during the audition i was fine but while i was waiting i was very nervous i was hopeful id get through but i was over the moon when they told me
4029561 we would fight against the closure if the postmaster wanted us to and if he thought it was worth it
4029562 me and other councillors have been to visit him and offered our support and to set up a petition but he didnt want to
4029563 our main concern was for the people at the local old folks home needing close access to the post office but we will probably be able to offer some kind of support such as transport to and from another post office
4029564 i am feeling very angry about the decision i will be writing to the government to complain about the whole process as we had a very strong argument and huge petitions to save the post offices in the most socially exclueded areas of my constituancy
4029565 there is a substantial lack of alternative for people and i am angry that the post office failed in their promise to provide the information on their funds for subsidy
4029566 at one time it was just older folk with flat caps but that has definitely started to change now gardening programmes on the television and a push towards healthy eating and organic foods has made allotments more fashionable with younger people
4029567 the smaller plots would be easier to maintain and would help reduce the waiting list
4029568 theres about 16 people on the waiting list for allotments in the borough but were hoping they will take up plots at valley road
4029569 its going to be a community gardens with the community running the place and taking care of the day to day management theres quite a lot of interest already but were hoping for more when the words out
4029570 i became very depressed when i was ill and had nothing to do but just sit there i cant do a lot all at once but a little bit every day keeps your mind busy and your body active it stops you going mad
4029571 people want homegrown vegetables without chemical treatments but people think allotments are just for growing vegetables this is my garden and i grow everything including flowers theres all these programmes but not once do they show what allotments are really like vegetables are for the body but flowers are for the soul

4029574 my sister has been suffering with headaches for about two years and she went to have her eyes tested in february and they turned round and told her to go straight to the hospital
4029575 they ran tests on her and found she had a grade three brain tumour which was quite extensive
4029576 ive not really left her bedside since and decided i wanted to do something to help
4029577 i could have done a fun run or something like that but i wanted to do something that would really raise awareness and generate thousands of pounds and together with thomas mcdonough we came up with this idea of me fighting all these people in one night

4029583 ross parke a canadian professor of psychology at the university of california says it was always thought that mothers were hormonally primed to be parents and the fathers learned child rearing culturally
4029584 many father researchers are intrigued by the fact that dads have a different parenting style from mums in a 1997 us study by the national center for education statistics looked at nearly 17 000 students from kindergarten to year 12 adn found there is a payoff when dads participate in activities at school such as volunteering or attending regular school meetings and parent teacher conferences the kids get more a grades enjoy school more and take part in more extracurricular activities
4029585 if you dont lose your cool and you try to be positive they really seem to appreciate it

4029645 you need airwaves to broadcast but you can build a website online and do something on your own in the new media world if you look at what
4029646 well have the stories and locations where they occured but we hope to have walking tours on the website that you can download and customize for your ipod and then take them out for a walk
4029647 it would be great for us to partner with local atlanta organizations that promote walking and biking like the atlanta bicycle campaign and then we could co host events with them and get people outside that way

4029658 if anyone can transcend the limited shelf life of olympians its phelps
4029659 i personally believe online gaming for the greater society marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows online gaming for the greater society industry leaders
4029660 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the online gaming for the greater society industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
4029661 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our online gaming for the greater society products get the right emails
4029662 everyone in this online gaming for the greater society sector knows how to blast out email notices fliers etc to people but not everyone knows how to do this in an efficient manner that creates profit margin efficieny in our industry is absolutely key
4029663 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of online gaming for the greater society marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
4029664 a representative from the online gaming for the greater society company pigat pidgeon recently argued that change is necessary to move things forward
4029665 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the
4029666 i think the potential for success marketing gaming club casino in most all countries so why not casino games
4029667 get a online gaming for the greater society com at all costs
4029668 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
4029669 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
4029670 privacy is absolutely key in the online gaming for the greater society business
4029671 once top domains are registered their security protection and legacy becomes mission critical
4029672 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making online gaming for the greater society related buying decisions
4029673 if you buy mcgalliard ruis com youre the only one who can have that address it is entirely unique and therefore by virtue of its rarity it immediately can accrue value you may find that you get tons of email offers for your domain name this will allow you to sort out whos serious and whos just fooling around and then after youve found a good online gaming for the greater society industry buyer youll surely make some great profits
4029674 the great thing about online gaming for the greater society domains
4029675 is that they are universal around the world once you lock up a short simple domain you can market the hell out of it and cash in on the high revenue online gaming for the greater society industry
4029676 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
4029677 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for online gaming for the greater society companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
4029678 this is good news for all those in the online gaming for the greater society marketing business
4029679 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
4029680 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the
4029681 i think the potential for success marketing gaming club casino in most all countries so why not casino games
4029682 deixa me olhar para o lado e fingir que n o vi isto

4029684 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4029685 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4029686 fourth place is about the worst place you can be in the olympic games
4029687 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
4029688 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4029689 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind i dont want to be that way to be doing that stuff if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
4029690 four seconds under the old world record people wouldve thought that was incredible gold silver or bronze
4029691 i never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
4029692 its been eating at me for a long time so to go out and accomplish a medal is really exciting
4029693 it is bitterly disappointing for luke and we wish him all the best for a speedy recovery but both brett sheehan and sam cordingley have been putting up their hand and are itching for the opportunity to play in the nine jersey
4029694 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4029695 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4029696 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4029697 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4029698 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4029699 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4029700 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4029701 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4029702 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4029703 the situation is that kerry asked for an interpretation of rule from croke park which we didnt want to give because it is not our job to do that
4029704 i understand he trained earlier this week kerry have now been informed in writing by the ard sti rth ir p draic duffy that it is his belief and my belief that it is contrary to rule he has been told not to train and kerry have accepted that
4029705 what happened happened and we are not going to review that situation
4029706 kerry have been communicated with officially and they have accepted that
4029707 we were led to believe it was up to the kerry county board to interpret the rule as we saw fit
4029708 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4029709 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4029710 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4029711 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4029712 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4029713 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4029714 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4029715 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4029716 that was a medal prospect and we are very very disappointed
4029717 we have had such a great four days so that was a smack in the face for us all
4029718 we have to turn that around now and pull for the rest of the team we are absolutely gutted and i am sorry for all the disappointed people at home
4029719 thats sport it is the cruelest thing in the world and thats why people watch it
4029720 the other teams swam a lot better than we expected i think our time was great but not enough to get us in there
4029721 we are all really gutted it is not an easy position to be in when you thought you were going to be after a medal
4029722 it was a mistake to select fran on the last leg it was always going to be a risk and so it proved
4029723 after swimming in the 100m heats earlier it looked like a misjudgment
4029724 i dont know why we rested two of our girls i would have put becky adlington in and asked her to do just enough to get us through into the final
4029725 it was a horrible fight but the build up was so long and im just glad i got rid of this pressure
4029726 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4029727 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4029728 i knew he was on my side of the draw and it doesnt get any tougher than having to play the olympic champion but im as good as anyone
4029729 i dont care who i face next now because they all know what im capable of doing
4029730 its big to beat one of the greats but anyone in the worlds top 32 can beat each other because the sport is that close
4029731 im in the top 16 and i qualified as 21st so everything is a bonus from now
4029732 i dont feel any pressure but marco told me that i better go on and win the gold
4029733 i was pretty nervious for the first round match because no one want to lose at that stage my routine was a bit out and i clearly wasnt at my best
4029734 its a fine line between shooting tens and eights and when you are under pressure you sometimes cross that line
4029735 against marco i was a lot more composed when im shooting against an archer of a higher standard i always raise my game

4029739 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4029740 in the road race i was doing my job for the team but this one was all for me
4029741 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt i just imagine a friend sitting on my wheel shouting at me
4029742 despite all that ive been waiting years for this and i really enjoyed myself id have loved gold but you cant be unhappy with silver
4029743 i gave it absolutely everything i wouldnt have been in contention if it was a long straight course but there were enough hills to make it interesting
4029744 that was my plan to go out really fast and try to maintain it for as long as possible
4029745 i have gone under world record pace before i gave it everything i had so i cant look back with any regrets
4029746 it was very hard out there and in the last 25m i was completely exhausted i just felt like i was treading water and i knew the others were catching me but there was nothing more i could do
4029747 i gave it my all and i can go away satisfied i did die a lot on the last length i didnt even think i was going to finish in the last 15m because my arms were so heavy
4029748 i will just need to keep my legs kicking all the way
4029749 my strength is my speed off the mark what i need to do is just keep it going for the whole race
4029750 there will be some very good swimmers there so it is going to be really hard but this is what the olympics are all about testing yourself against the best in the world
4029751 theres no way i would buy powders or extracts i work with raw materials
4029752 i hope to offer a little more than ice cream a little love
4029753 ice cream has always been my passion since i was a little girl
4029754 i make three gelati in an hour compared with about 10 with an industrial mix that only requires adding milk or water
4029755 the only hope is that consumers read the list of ingredients and spot the colourings flavourings and stabilisers
4029756 artisanal does not mean opening a tin it means working with your hands
4029757 are happy to make medium quality ice cream using fruit syrup for the tourists
4029758 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4029759 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4029760 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4029761 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4029762 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4029763 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4029764 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4029765 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4029766 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4029767 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4029768 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4029769 who are open to doing something on the production side
4029770 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4029771 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4029772 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4029773 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4029774 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4029775 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4029776 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4029777 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4029778 they dont even know who the georgian president is how can you call them georgians they are brazilians and that is who we played against
4029779 when i was younger i learned to play the bagpipes with the 10th finchley scottish scout group the only scottish scout group south of the border
4029780 we were all just so happy and excited that we were singing the national anthem rather badly
4029781 we were all out of tune because we have not sung it much weve just never had the practice
4029782 i hope one day to play for the likes of manchester united chelsea or real madrid
4029783 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4029784 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4029785 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4029786 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4029787 my mindset has to be that were going into the new season with the players ive got
4029788 i speak to niall quinn chairman and peter walker chief executive regularly in terms of the players were looking to bring in
4029789 people think it changes on a daily or a weekly basis but it changes hour to hour if you look since ive come to the club and all the transfers ive been involved with ive had great support so if things dont happen in the next week or two i dont think im in a great position to complain
4029790 i wouldnt have thought thered be any new arrivals by saturday id be very surprised but it seems to change by the hour with some deals there are no bids on the table but that will probably change as well
4029791 we did put in a substantial offer for a n o t h e r player and we are prepared to pay for quality
4029792 midfield wise were pretty decent pretty strong but we need to improve defensively and of course going forward i have no problem spending money
4029793 my mindset was always that jonny was going to go back to united and it was going to be a hard deal to do as its proving to be
4029794 when united sold gerard pique we were pretty sure they would hold on to jonny
4029795 we are short in terms of defenders weve only really got five defenders with the first team we probably need improvement i wouldnt have thought we have any chance of getting him back if youd seen the email david gill chief executive sent us back youd be pretty sure it was going to be hard work
4029796 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4029797 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4029798 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4029799 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4029800 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4029801 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4029802 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4029803 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4029804 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4029805 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4029806 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4029807 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4029808 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4029809 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4029810 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4029811 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4029812 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4029813 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4029814 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4029815 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4029816 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4029817 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4029818 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4029819 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4029820 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4029821 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4029822 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4029823 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4029824 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4029825 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4029826 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4029827 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4029828 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4029829 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4029830 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4029831 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4029832 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4029833 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4029834 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4029835 people are buying this casino computer programmer volunteers stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
4029836 im so thankful that many casino computer programmer volunteers industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
4029837 and eventually i want to start my own casino computer programmer volunteers business that will parallel my work in hollywood
4029838 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
4029839 budget cuts are keeping schools from upgrading equipment and many classrooms are using older notebooks students at our local schools have complained of batteries that last only 10 15 minutes before needing to be changed this is a distraction for the students and the teachers what schools need is a low cost power upgrade solution tailored for their specific needs the right charger combined with six new high capacity oncore batteries can maximize students run time and improve a schools performance on older notebooks at a fraction of the cost of buying a new machine today
4029840 the european union must be prepared to commit itself including on the ground
4029841 many countries have said that they are ready to join in
4029842 we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
4029843 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4029844 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4029845 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
4029846 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4029847 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4029848 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4029849 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4029850 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4029851 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4029852 but i feel i can also still contribute on the field
4029853 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer
4029854 and since returning to the first team i feel ive proved that
4029855 at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country and the opportunity to work with the senior players and continue the development of the younger bowlers is one i am relishing
4029856 on the field he has had a tough 18 months
4029857 but he is now playing regularly with the 1st xi
4029858 he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4029859 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
4029860 it gives those agencies carte blanche to do what they want
4029861 its not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
4029862 its ridiculous to admit that something is endangered because of climate change and then say the law doesnt apply to climate change
4029863 the bush administration is trying to do by regulation what they cant do by legislation

4029868 i mean i wouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving by with a video camera on the roof filming me either
4029869 what do you do when you lose a mate like that
4029870 i know what he would have done if i left he would have partied too thats what i wouldve wanted him to do so thats what i did with some friends
4029871 both my parents were pictured outside their house but my dad passed away a month ago
4029872 while recognising that google time is never real time the image renews the raw loss
4029873 while others may have legitimate complaints about google publishing pictures of their house i was delighted to view ours with me pictured hard at work in the garden complete with broom and bucket thereby dispelling any uncertainty as to who is the gardener in the family

4029898 weve caught five of them the rest of the fugitives are still at large and we have intensified our search
4029899 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled
4029900 what is surprising is the sheer scale of the cynicism calling black white and white black portraying aggressors as victims
4029901 sir your fashion has the cold heart of a killer
4029902 it was difficult it was the first time ive ever had to do that in my career
4029903 ive never been injured before to that magnitude anyway obviously its been difficult considering i was going to be a contributor last year and then early in the season our first big ten game i went out
4029904 i learned to coach from the sidelines continue to progress as a player even though i wasnt out there
4029905 not only that but taking my rehab day by day and trying to get back as soon as i could im not the first guy thats had that happen thats why you cant feel sorry for yourself its football and things like that happen
4029906 i felt like i could be back almost for the bowl game
4029907 thats how it felt really but that last 10 percent was the most difficult to get over and i was still going through that in spring ball i wasnt 100 percent for spring ball but the big step for me was to be able to get through healthy without any setbacks
4029908 just the same thing we saw in minnesota and san antonio every game that would be perfect
4029909 i say it jokingly but i think that was kind of like a breakout for him
4029910 i dont mean this disrespectful to andy but the front end of his career he was kind of feeling his way around
4029911 i dont want to call him a rec league player but it was kind of like that he was good at practice but im not sure he understood all the things you have to do to really become a total football player and he was playing a position he didnt play in high school
4029912 that year i think he figured out all the things youve got to do then it shows up on the field for him
4029913 thats a young group so thats really important hes given us more than just production on the field
4029914 hes moving real well and hes looking like the old andy brodell
4029915 its been a long road back but i definitely feel like im healthy and ill be able to contribute
4029916 i dont feel like ive lost a step and lets hope that holds true
4029917 ive had a long time to recover but not only that ive had along time to digest everything and kind of get over the whole fact that i did get hurt
4029918 i dont know this year im not thinking about the past
4029919 hahaha we destroyed the hopes and dreams of a generation of faux romantics
4029920 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man
4029921 therefore genesis 1 1 should be translated in the beginning god fattened and filled the heavens and the earth
4029922 thats 300 students in two days if we keep going like this were going to have to add teachers by the end of the week
4029923 if we collapse a class we have a place for the teacher to go
4029924 the more students we have the more money we get
4029925 were doing a lot of repeat exercises to gauge consistency
4029926 it will be sensitive enough to not only see and detect radiation sources but also detect particular components of the source the exact isotope
4029927 in this setting we can tell if whats supposed to happen is actually happening
4029928 that way we get to understand not only the technical performance but the users perspectives as well
4029929 for many we became familiar with the immunizations and issues that affect the health of children but along the way we have left out our teenagers
4029930 this is a way to bring an awareness of what adolescents need such as boosters to remain healthy and protected
4029931 we wanted them to represent the teen voice and let us know what teens are thinking and how they are feeling about topics such as gardasil and hpv
4029932 it makes it a well rounded awareness event by including them
4029933 when people see something they can get the situation taken care of immediately
4029934 i hope those witnessing this will see that these are human beings not just numbers
4029935 i was fascinated she told stories of her home country ghost stories
4029936 we could hire every graduate for the next 10 years
4029937 they have to have good people skills because theyll be out in nuclear power plants working side by side with operators and engineers pulling air samples
4029938 theyll have respirators or plastic suits to protect themselves theres some theory involved but anyone that can handle algebra physics and chemistry can do this
4029939 even though facilities have been shut down we still have to maintain the same radiation levels at those areas so it provides job coverage
4029940 you get to work with a lot of work groups operations engineers electricians maintenance mechanics and youre the one person thats responsible for radiological conditions on that job
4029941 we recertify workers every two years its a very formal program with a lot of training
4029942 its a critical skill set we have to get in place to continue our mission and push forward with the nuclear renaissance
4029943 while i was in college i worked in the civil and magistrate court office but i thought that would be it
4029944 at the time i wanted to go and live in the big city when i graduated and do something there
4029945 after three years there i knew that the big city was not where i wanted to be i quickly came back home and have been here since
4029946 i feel that what we do matters our job is extremely important
4029947 a lot of people will question what we do when an election is not going on but theres a lot of stuff we do to make sure that when an election does take place it goes smoothly
4029948 what i appreciate the most about travis is his absolute loyalty and dedication to this office
4029949 he goes above and beyond the call of duty and despite the stressful conditions our office is sometimes under you never hear a complaint from him
4029950 in his profession people throughout the state will call on him for advice clarification of laws and procedures we are very fortunate as a board to have someone with travis capabilities he is very thorough very reliable and very dedicated which is proven by the respect and admiration he receives from other boards throughout the state
4029951 theres a lot of interest out there people want to know whats going on what they need to do so they can vote and generally about the election process itself
4029952 i enjoying knowing that by working in this office im helping to make their voice heard
4029953 its exciting to play a part in the process that allows the people to elect their representatives
4029954 i am a taxpaying citizen who expects more than what is provided
4029955 persons not sitting or sitting partially outside of the school bus seats will not be afforded the occupant protection provided by the school bus seats
4029956 oh no we do not support standing on a school bus
4029957 the rigor of the curriculum and critical analysis and reading comprehension at the school level
4029958 you wish you can help in the process more than you physically can
4029959 the more we got into it the more we began to get interested in the conflicts
4029960 you wouldnt go in there and say we can fix your problems
4029961 one thing we learned at corrymeela you can never get peace without forgiveness
4029962 i mean you always want a good lineup but we were very fortunate that some of the people alexis was close to happen to play in some really great bands
4029963 i have to be careful because i do think it is possible to get so busy that you lose sight of what is going on
4029964 i am afraid that ill wake up one day and really get slapped in the face by everything that has happened still i believe throwing myself into this has been good therapy
4029965 it makes you feel like something higher is in control we all work together here and what ive learned is that while you may not always agree with people that doesnt mean you have to have a problem with them so you dont agree big deal thats not as it turns out what is important
4029966 im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century of course we have to deal with russia and deal with putin but it has to be on a very realistic basis
4029967 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g8 so they should be excluded
4029968 nato is part of the cause of the problem not the solution by encircling and humiliating russia nato has created the climate in russia so favourable to putin
4029969 the park closes at dusk night hikes are visitors only chance to see the park at night
4029970 more conducive to families and its a nice way to check out the park
4029971 to say that we will miss him is a definite understatement
4029972 this life we lead is not an easy one at times and to have been part of the same lineup for 10 years has truly been a blessing for all of us
4029973 we have been practicing for six weeks two days each week for this game
4029974 we have our heads and hearts ready for the game we are going to play hard play fair and play to win
4029975 our guys were tired their guys were tired it just became a matter of who would outlast the other it helped that the crowd was out there rooting for us the underdog what makes the win even better is that we were playing for charity
4029976 fundraisers like this are critical for us its also a way to let people know we are here and what we do
4029977 in addition to that these games are always exciting because they are usually close and its a chance for people to see their doctor or lawyer in a different light
4029978 we typically have tight games so we knew we had to give it our all
4029979 when you know that you are helping to raise money for such an important organization it makes you play harder this event helps them a lot and were happy to participate
4029980 everyone knows what the goal is everyone does their homework everything is for the communal good and everyone knows it they know that any suggestion made is for the good of the group as a whole nobody is being malicious
4029981 it comes from owning and running a business from working in radio its something i knew that i could do could contribute
4029982 there are bad edits a terrible one on yer blues and it shifts from four to eight tracks there are timing issues so we have had to make miniscule artistic choices
4029983 its a montage i mean there are people that have done live versions of the song but just because you can doesnt mean you ought to
4029984 it was a hand me down from my brother in law i think it was a takamine
4029985 playing at rose hill was great because it gave me a chance to play all my original songs
4029986 me and my fianc e are going on our honeymoon to canc n here pretty soon so you can put that down looking forward to that
4029987 nap i love taking some naps especially when its raining
4029988 these bottom line numbers certainly do not reflect a city in a downward spiral by any means
4029989 i really think that this is a phenomenal effort to try and increase the level of education in schools and universities about the area of online marketing
4029990 i downloaded the book for free its available as such under a creative commons license thinking i knew everything and would likely at best pass it on as a resource to a few clients sheesh i got hooked and havent been able to stop reading it its really really phenomenal
4029991 well done guys ive already referred a client to it to help him think through his marketing strategy
4029992 i found it to be thorough well written and full of good examples and explanations
4029993 if youre interested in harnessing the power of the web to build your brand then this emarketing textbook is a must read
4029994 i just got my hands on the brand spanking new quirk emarketing textbook by rob stokes and the minds at quirk its hot so much juicy info and a lot of recent case studies
