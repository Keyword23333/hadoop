160000 signing luol has always been a priority for this organization and we have always felt that he was a big part of our future we are very happy that luol will now be with us long term as we continue to grow as an organization
160001 ive always said i am very lucky very blessed to have had the right people around me ive always tried to be positive through all the hard times to try and be positive about what ive been given and to work hard and be smart
160002 as for the money and how to celebrate i dont know what to do i did manage a nice dinner and i have to admit the food tasted a little better than it has done for some time the last few weeks when i was eating my chicken and pasta my mind was somewhere else i wasnt getting the right taste
160003 i really do feel there is a good chemistry with the new coach
160004 i got to watch summer league a little bit went to practices saw the coach and the new staff we have derrick rose and a lot of young guys coming back so i got to watch them practice the way we are going to play next year has me really excited and i feel ill fit into the system really well
160005 the coach is talking about how hes going to use me and what he thinks of me as a player i definitely feel as though the bulls see me as a cornerstone of the team but i am only going to show that by working hard i have no problem with that because i know im going to do it
160006 he told me that he would play for great britain if his contract is done depending how soon it is done
160007 now ive got my deal done i think the bulls will focus more on ben and hopefully they will come to an agreement
160008 i dont blame him for making that move at some point in time you have to be the aggressor its kind of like weve been negotiating since last summer i dont think theres any reason why it should be dragged out this long and he feels the same
160009 i dont want my no 1 receiver to be worse than say
160010 i cant think of anybody ill just take a second kicker that i dont need
160011 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
160012 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
160013 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
160014 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
160015 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
160016 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
160017 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
160018 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

160027 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
160028 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
160029 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
160030 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
160031 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
160032 the inclusion of automatic integration between isynergy and other enterprise applications allows our customers to simply and easily innovate how they distribute and manage content between applications

160055 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
160056 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
160057 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
160058 inmediatamente al tribunal constitucional la retirada de su imposici n de suspensi n de la ley
160059 hacemos cuatro emplazamientos al presidente del gobierno que nos reciba que nos escuche que nos tome en consideraci n y que recupere la se as de identidad de la izquierda
160060 creemos que tenemos el mismo derecho a m s para que se nos de una oportunidad similar
160061 en base al ejercicio de nuestro derecho de decisi n
160062 y esto es sin duda que sea el tiempo y no el derecho la oculta intenci n del camino emprendido por el presidente
160063 consideramos de extrema gravedad la paralizaci n pol tica de una consulta popular no vinculante cuyo objetivo es conocer la opini n de la sociedad vasca en relaci n con el final dialogado de la violencia y la soluci n pol tica del conflicto vasco por eso queremos denunciar este veto pol tico del presidente del gobierno espa ol que pretende impedir el libre ejercicio del derecho a la participaci n pol tica de los ciudadanos vascos
160064 hoy solemnemente le pedimos al presidente del gobierno espa ol que respete el principio democr tico del derecho a decidir de la ciudadan a vasca y de sus instituciones
160065 habida cuenta de la gravedad de la situaci n denunciada
160066 sometimes they have to be pointed out for you but some people are luckier than others
160067 but some people stumble upon them without even looking for them some people dont even want to find them but they do others search forever and dont
160068 dont worry you can count on me to be here when im supposed to be my previous employer will also tell you that i dont miss a lot of work
160069 i love it here and im never going back i can hardly make myself go visit my family now ha ha
160070 its a trend we were seeing many science centers across the country do
160071 weve been getting more and more calls as more and more hollywood films are getting released in the imax format and weve always tried to react to what our audiences are looking for
160072 we know that people come here to see those mission based films the classic travelogue films that are high in science content those films are increasingly expensive to make
160073 helps us keep the legacy alive with these mission films
160074 we had a multimillion dollar bond that we used to pay for that project
160075 people demand to see these movies in the imax format
160076 the quality is higher and its a much more immersive experience
160077 that chain may have the right to prevent a film from showing at least on the opening day
160078 we have continued to have a lot of calls about the dark knight
160079 but the decision here was that we wanted to try and stay with the films that relate to our core audience the films rating didnt match what we were trying to do here
160080 theyre coming out of the woodwork looking for homes in prince william
160081 isnt that crazy i cant believe were in this situation again
160082 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
160083 right about now there are a lot of workplaces that could use some laughter the national unemployment rate in may increased a full percentage point to 5 5 percent compared with may 2007 before leveling off last month layoffs from the auto to housing industries have decimated companies and morale
160084 why help someone who is going to turn around and do the same thing once the economy turns around
160085 so in spite of having the gift of levity i find i have to move on frequently to other offices to avoid negative backwash over simply having fun with the people i work with
160086 i didnt work my tail off to save that money just to lose it in a bad investment
160087 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
160088 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
160089 a number of websites are now available thats what counts that things are moving forward we are pleased with the way they have handled and resolved the issues
160090 beijing organizers will honor the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
160091 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
160092 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised
160093 chinese people have just as much right to freedom of information as everyone else yet this right has been systematically denied we are calling on the chinese government to end internet repression
160094 it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed its time for the olympic movement and world leaders to speak up about human rights for china
160095 tis rather a shame willum couldnt be here as well
160096 look at that lizzie our grandsons bought us a a pantomime cow
160097 damage the quality of education and would harm university reputations
160098 lack of interest in education and the way it operates
160099 ill experienced people with no record in teaching international students and little understanding of english for academic purposes
160100 we will of course consider carefully any letter we receive relating to into or any other education provider
160101 ucus priority remains as ever defending the interests of staff and their students and the quality of higher education itself
160102 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on
160103 lets just try this once more and if its the last one thats hard lines
160104 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
160105 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
160106 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
160107 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
160108 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
160109 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater

160114 you just feel part of nature this is so rare
160115 it is quite eerie for any thinking person to watch how everything turns into darkness in broad daylight
160116 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
160117 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
160118 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
160119 but i didnt turn out to have any special genius so i cant say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me
160120 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
160121 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
160122 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
160123 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population

160134 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
160135 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why

160184 short form video is an emerging entertainment genre distinct from online tv that consistently proves popular with people of widely varying backgrounds and tastes as demonstrated yet again by the magid survey

160190 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
160191 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
160192 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
160193 we work efficiently and successfully in current unfavorable market conditions
160194 thus we make an important contribution to stabilize the financial system
160195 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
160196 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower

160203 i became leader of the bathlabour group to fight for the rights of working students at university in bath looking back i think this is one of labours proudest achievements in government
160204 we built on this by increasing the minimum wage and bringing in better safeguards at work like better maternity leave and paternity leave for dads for the first time
160205 labour has come down hard on those people that dont pay workers the minimum wage and there are even tougher penalties for rogue employers who con staff as part of labours employment bill now before parliament as labour leader ill be supporting this bill
160206 if you think a rogue employer is not paying up then get in touch with me

160210 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
160211 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
160212 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
160213 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
160214 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
160215 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
160216 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 percent
160217 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin

160250 every week hundreds of vulnerable migrants mainly from sub saharan africa but also from asia are referred to iom by religious and charitable institutions or by their embassies to ask for voluntary return and reintegration assistance
160251 over the past two years we have provided comprehensive return and reintegration assistance to some 2 200 stranded migrants from 22 countries but our appeal launched in april for eur 1 25 million to keep the programme running has not generated any concrete pledges from donors
160252 this would have a dire impact on so many undocumented migrants who have come to rely on iom to return home
160253 iom has applied to the eu for new project funding and a decision is expected later this year
160254 but without immediate bridging funds the programme will have to close as a result migrants will be left without the option of voluntary return and reintegration and some may well risk their lives to reach europe

160270 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
160271 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
160272 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
160273 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
160274 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
160275 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
160276 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
160277 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
160278 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
160279 once this campaign is launched we will be going from ward to ward making a situation analyse for each family because we are committed to eradicating poverty in our communities
160280 as a country we also want to migrate from the relief that comes from social grants
160281 the food crisis is not a challenge which will disappear tomorrow so lets consider establishing vegetable gardens in our yards the solution to this challenge is in our hands
160282 we are grateful that youve been gathered to seek solutions to food crises and the entire challenges within the agricultural sector
160283 as government we are eagerly waiting for your programme of action which will guide us during the agriculture strategic plan next week because we want to make the industry sustainable vibrant and visible

160289 when we purchased the tales of beedle the bard at auction we never envisioned that wed have the opportunity to share the book with amazon customers in such a unique and special way
160290 we are thrilled and grateful that j k rowling and the childrens high level group were gracious enough to give us this opportunity to create the collectors edition and we think harry potter fans and amazon customers around the world will love it
160291 on a year over year basis we saw significant improvements across a number of key operating metrics ranging from gross margins to non gaap earnings per share and cash flow from operations
160292 despite this progress and strong growth in international geographies slowing performance in the u s impacted top line revenue growth looking forward we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings from the opensolaristm operating system and the mysqltm database to the lustretm and zfstm storage systems the foundation of our open storage platforms

160300 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
160301 send regards to israel i miss it i respect israel and admire it as a country
160302 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet muhammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
160303 an entire society that sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists
160304 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
160305 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
160306 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
160307 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
160308 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
160309 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
160310 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
160311 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
160312 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
160313 i respect and admire senator obama we just have stark differences
160314 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
160315 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
160316 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
160317 who seeks such an approach is really seeking a religious war
160318 when the muslims came here they never found any standing building or any culture still alive so they never threatened any standing building
160319 we are not going to entertain theories about buildings that may or may not have been here before
160320 its difficult to approach a gate while passing through cemeteries through graves

160322 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
160323 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
160324 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration there are no conditions for discontinuation other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself

160329 il resoconto di una ricerca svolta tra il 2004 e il 2005 su un gruppo di wardrivers italiani della provincia di salerno
160330 first and most important congress should make clear that a federal court may not order the government to bring enemy combatants into the united states
160331 second it is imperative that the proceedings for these enemy combatants be conducted in a way that protects how our nation gathers intelligence and what that intelligence is
160332 third congress should make clear that habeas proceedings should not delay the military commission trials of detainees charged with war crimes
160333 dit tart wat de knvb betreft alle fatsoensnormen daar is geen excuus voor geen enkele werkgever accepteert bedreigingen aan het adres van eigen personeel de knvb ook niet
160334 we hebben in het verleden niet vaak gereageerd op uitlatingen van deze scheidsrechter maar we laten ons echt niet neerzetten als onfatsoenlijke organisatie helaas gaat het vaak zo met dick jol je spreekt iets met hem af en vervolgens doet hij wat anders maar jol was een goede scheidsrechter en daar werd hij op beoordeeld anders was het al veel eerder tot een breuk gekomen
160335 we got the result we wanted and progressed to the next round though it was a difficult evening at times
160336 streymur came with a damage limitation plan got plenty of people behind the ball and made it very difficult
160337 the balance of the game was overwhelming and we were never in danger even though they stuck at it well i am sure they enjoyed the experience and their fans got behind them
160338 overall i think we have the talent in the squad to ensure we have a decent run in the competition if we have beneficial cards dealt to us in terms of the draw i feel the clubs in the uefa cup are well matched
160339 in terms of new signings we are still looking at the options and i am delighted we have added ben haim to the squad and we will try and get him some game time at stockport
160340 i feel things are moving in the right direction for the big kick off on august 17 there are no other incoming transfers imminent but we are always looking to bring in quality players at the right price
160341 i want to have a look at the ones who didnt take part at barnsley
160342 that was always the plan it will be a completely different at county
160343 was your mother at one time in service at the palace

160345 is er iemand die ik op de hoogte moet stellen van uw verblijf in detentie hier
160346 ik geloof niet dat er iemand is die er niet van op de hoogte is dat ik hier ben
160347 kunt u meneer karadzic uitleggen wat de nadelen zijn als hij zelf zijn eigen zaak moet verdedigen
160348 door drie mannen in burger die mij drie dagen lang ontvoerden
160349 dit zijn leugens waar ik niet langer commentaar op wens te geven
160350 ik heb dat onderbouwd weerlegd maar de aivd blijft bij de weigering om de verklaring af te geven
160351 als het vertrouwen wordt opgezegd n er wordt geen verklaring van geen bezwaar afgegeven dan is de realiteit dat je geen korpschef meer kunt zijn
160352 ik zie namelijk geen aanwijsbare reden waarom nu ineens dat vertrouwen moest worden opgezegd
160353 nu is het nog zomervakantie maar straks beginnen de scholen weer en komen de schoolgidsen uit waarin de uiteindelijk gekozen data staan dat wordt schrikken voor de ouders
160354 de regio kreeg als eerste zomervakantie maar nu als laatste herfstvakantie tien weken later
160355 begin dit jaar is die foute aansluiting ontdekt waarna de data korte tijd gewijzigd zijn op de site van het ministerie daarna is het weer terug veranderd ouders en scholen hebben dus verschillende data gezien
160356 we adviseren op onze site ook nadrukkelijk bij de school na te gaan welke data die hanteert
160357 want scholen zijn vrij hierin het gaat om adviesdata alleen de zomervakantie staat vast
160358 twee van onze scholen hadden de start van de herfstvakantie een week eerder staan
160359 scholen zouden de ouders ge nformeerd moeten hebben ouders moeten weten dat het om adviesdata gaat en het ministerie had niet tussentijds een wijziging op die site moeten zetten
160360 im glad its the last act i do because i dont have the energy to do another one right away
160361 my grandfather ran the largest travelling circus sideshow in canada from 1920 to 1968 and so im carrying on a tradition thats been in our family for three generations
160362 the time that he was travelling was the heyday of carnivals and so he raised a family of nine children during the depression because people would go and spend their money at a carnival nowadays carnivals have become corporate which is a real shame
160363 its something that was lost in the midways of the 70s and 80s it was the heart of the carnival at one time
160364 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
160365 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
160366 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
160367 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
160368 americans are innocent until theyre proven guilty our campaign made the decision to donate the contributions to charity to avoid distraction
160369 gordon brown has to take some unpalatable bold decisions give a chance to flintoff and i think hell take all the wickets today and hell probably win the match
160370 people are unhappy about our position in iraq we should get our boys and girls back it would be a terrific signal and welcomed by the entire country
160371 american officials said that the communications were intercepted before the july 7 bombing and that the c i a emissary stephen r kappes the agencys deputy director had been ordered to islamabad pakistans capital even before the attack
160372 the intercepts were not detailed enough to warn of any specific attack
160373 the government officials were guarded in describing the new evidence and would not say specifically what kind of assistance the isi officers provided to the militants
160374 the isi officers had not been renegades indicating that their actions might have been authorized by superiors
160375 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
160376 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
160377 the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
160378 the players have been playing with them from the start so if they hadnt been exposed to them that would be probably more of an issue
160379 to be honest the all blacks probably profited from them more than we did in the first encounter they scored three tries from free kicks
160380 i guess until you really face the challenge and you come up short that you really have to think deeply about whats going on there
160381 i watch a bit of rugby on video and try and analyse the game and spend a lot of time doing that and so do the other two guys assistant coaches
160382 hes not working out it doesnt seem like he plans to hes just golfing
160383 and i think now with data like these and as well as lots of other data showing other things are discombobulated in some manner that were now saying well its not something that you just say get over it stiff upper lip away we go
160384 the datas really compelling that its a neurochemical imbalance what causes the neurochemical imbalance we dont fully comprehend but perhaps this is one of the clues
160385 does the chemical modification that we know this gene does does it occur at a higher frequency the answer is yes does it occur at a higher frequency in a gene that we know already is down regulated in depression and the answer was yes to that as well
160386 we might be able to have a treatment for depression
160387 this is a new area of research and this certainly is a nice contribution
160388 the paper is basically a series of associations so instead of actually showing that x causes y its sort of a relationship between x and y
160389 14 of the parks rarest most unusual oldest and tallest specimens are displayed on a simple clickable map each click triggers a window with more information and three beautiful images
160390 it was great to collaborate with lmo on this feature theyre really passionate and they are experts on the subject
160391 its nice to grow our web site with features that are educational and fun to use
160392 our decision to take this step is not a happy one
160393 the new positions will be responsible for virtually all elements of the day to day operations on both of these lines and will be given their own railroads and the responsibility for running them to the satisfaction of our customers
160394 im not going to tell my wife about this because shes in this park every day
160395 some guy was bludgeoned about a year and a half ago on the other side of the park a known homosexual it was in the vale of cashmere

160408 e questo un segno tangibile di lotta e di contrasto contro la criminalit organizzata che continua a moritificare le speranze e la voglia di riscatto di una intera comunit e dei giovani in particolare la nuova normativa varata dal governo permette che i beni ed i terreni della camorra possano essere confiscati anche se intestati a persone non legate ai clan in questo modo non sar pi possibile eludere i controlli o sottrarre consistenti immobili al recupero da parte dello stato lobiettivo finale quello di ridare ai cittadini ci che gli stato sottratto sia in termini materiali che di libert civile la struttura che ospita anche il primo teatro cittadino sar sede di attivit di animazione sociale destinata ai giovani con questi eventi si afferma che lo stato affianco al cittadino e non i poteri criminali
160409 e stato un grande onore per la citt di mondragone
160410 essere stati coinvolti allinterno delliniziativa progettuale regionale e provinciale denominata costiera dei fiori
160411 abbiamo collaborato fin dal primo momento organizzando un programma ricco e variegato che mi auguro incontri come negli anni passati il favore del pubblico e degli ospiti della nostra citt
160412 im very disappointed race wont have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it
160413 stay indoors please as it is no longer advisable to come out or move about until we are through
160414 no search warrant was displayed and no court order was also shown to have been obtained
160415 we call on the security operatives to make public any evidence they have against our client or publicly apologise for this shameless raid
160416 all we want is a sovereign national conference where everyone must sit down and look at the union again we cant accept some people imposing their views on us telling us this is what you must do no we have to decide what we want
160417 i fought the nigerian states for twelve months under harm there was no report of kidnap no report of attack of one flow station no blow up of pipeline throughout the period i was there these things never happened until i went to prison and the people who imprisoned me set the motion bill to discredit the struggle
160418 those involved in kidnapping and causing troubles in the niger delta are not helping matters because they are not part of our struggle what is happening in the niger delta now is criminal economy we must purge ourselves of these counter revolutionaries
160419 the meaning of revolution is change and a change has already started before if a sanitary inspector comes into any ijaw village my people will run away if a tax collector comes everybody will run away
160420 the government has not been fair to goodluck if president yaradua wants niger delta conference he should start with the vice president and the ministers there when they sit down and dialogue
160421 the desire by the shell petroleum development company to partner with private hands to reintroduce the mobile clinic scheme in the niger delta is a welcome one which president yaradua will appreciate
160422 this is the reason all other multi national oil and gas companies should emulate the good gesture of the spdc by setting up their own mobile health scheme so that health care delivery will be carried to the door step of riverine niger deltans
160423 that is more reason mr president and indeed the federal government believes that there is need for everyone to come together to discuss who and who will do what and what and what and at what time frame a kind of division of labour in order to achieve better and urgent results
160424 it is not true that the federal government has dumped the niger delta dialogue and summit it is a question of perception which need the understanding of the nigerians and the media as far as this country is concerned we cannot abandon dialogue on all various issues we will continue to dialogue and the summit will move us from one level to other on various issues even if it is the issue of peace or national development the ongoing council meeting is part of effort and a preparatory to the entire dialogue to ensure that there is peace in the niger delta and other regions of the country
160425 towards the dialogue a lot of issues came up and we will continue to discuss these various issues so that we can agree and have a consensus prof gambaris case is one of these issues it is true that so many people including the media were against the choice of gambari as a listening government we had to reconsider the position and gambari himself decided to step down and that has moved us forward
160426 since i came in we have adopted a strategy of engaging and empowering the youths and also enforce the law which captures our strategy
160427 the militancy is not actually here it is very very far away in the creeks they dont really come to disturb anybody people come to bayelsa freely and of course even in the creeks they dont really disturb anybody we have not had any form of kidnapping in bayelsa for a long time whatever you hear about it is not here in bayelsa but whenever people say niger delta people tend to think that it is bayelsa because bayelsa is the epic centre of the niger delta kidnapping has not happened here for at least one year now
160428 i am very happy that for the first time niger delta is featuring in the seven point agenda of mr president this is our good time because we have the vice president of nigeria dr goodluck jonathan
160429 you cant be mad at a guy like manny he contributed so much to the red sox organization it was just unbelievable
160430 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
160431 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
160432 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
160433 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
160434 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
160435 the delivery of justice is an objective process and its difficult sometimes for those who are caught up in this sort of process to understand all the ramifications of how it works
160436 one can feel sorry for that but its more important that justice should be done weve been delivering justice in this island for centuries and i dont see how this makes any difference
160437 it is difficult for people outside to understand that in a small place you are particularly aware of the need to behave properly behave appropriately to have the integrity to take decisions which need to be taken
160438 i have had to consider the position of politicians and ministers and i have done that
160439 prevailing desire to sweep scandal and abuse under the carpet
160440 what has made this significantly different from many similar inquiries ive been involved with is the political hostility it has engendered
160441 politicians one would normally think should be crawling over themselves to offer support to the inquiry and the victims with a few notable exceptions that hasnt happened here the only intervention most of them seem to have made is to criticise the investigation
160442 the idf on wednesday presented its response to an ngo report that claims the judge office is closing cases and refraining from filing indictments against soldiers who mistreat palestinians in the territories
160443 it is regretful that even though the organization had these statistics it decided not to publish them
160444 the article relates the human rights groups accusations at length but the final paragraph informs the reader that idf denies the accusations and that the jerusalem post reports very different statistics than the human rights group
160445 we are here to continue to govern we have a mandate from the people we have a mandate from parliament in the last throne speech and we intend to proceed
160446 but what we will not allow is a situation where mr
160447 we also came upon findings dating back to the hellenistic period in the third century b c besides the ancient graves pertaining to the roman and byzantium times
160448 the discoveries tell us that the antalya district had been used as a residential site well before the time of attalos the pergamon king who was regarded as the founder of the city
160449 it is highly important for us to protect our historical artifacts and to pass them onto future generations upon the completion of this excavation which i respect a lot antalya will gain a new hotspot this will highly contribute to the international reputation of the city as well as to the growth of other sectors
160450 we will have the opportunity to exhibit the ancient graves of thousands of years to domestic and international tourists by turning the excavation site into an open excursion area
160451 we undertook the academic consultancy of the do u garaj excavations as the sole university in the city we worked with a team of 30 people and four professors and found 38 ancient graves on the site
160452 according to our agreement with the antalya city museum we would conduct the excavations for one and a half months which would be followed by a break for one month
160453 the museum wanted to go on with the excavations despite our absence which was of course unacceptable for us we could not undertake the academic consultancy of a project which we were not involved in
160454 antalya city museum created the conditions that forced us to abandon the project
160455 the museum told us that the works are progressing slowly since the excavation is too scientific i see antalya as a rather unlucky city for having such an understanding by one of its most important foundations
160456 with the permission of the culture and tourism ministry we started the excavation works on may 12 2008 with the aim of protecting our cultural heritage as well as preventing any attempts to steal the historical artifacts
160457 akdeniz university assigned their team to other excavation work in ka patara district and kumlucas rhadiopolis district between july 12 and september however the permission for the do u garaj excavations has been given up to the end of 2008 by the ministry in other words we need to go on with the works with or without them in order to get the best output within the shortest possible time
160458 the works are going on with great care and the antalya metropolitan municipality is supporting us in this project with some technical aids
160459 crazy tribes brutal terrain vicious combat hellacious weather anabasis is full of astounding endurance and heroism
160460 are so knowledgeable in this world of big historical pieces and i think theyre going to be formidable in the genre

160466 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
160467 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
160468 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
160469 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
160470 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
160471 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
160472 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
160473 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
160474 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
160475 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
160476 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
160477 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
160478 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
160479 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
160480 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
160481 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
160482 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
160483 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
160484 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
160485 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
160486 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
160487 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
160488 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living

160490 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
160491 i think its going to be far too tempting to one up your competitor because they dont think youre doing this but you really are to get it out earlier and try and get some first mover advantage
160492 so i dont think its going to be too long
160493 there are people that honestly believe the pc will come back and make consoles obsolete i think that probably is a naive view i think there are inherent challenges for the pc platform that consoles dont have that i would be surprised to see that desktop pc box making sony and 360 and wiis and everything obsolete i dont think thats going to happen

160496 tells the story of bastian balthaazar bux an outcast trying to get over the shock of losing his mother
160497 why would police officer jones just attack the defendant without any reason he doesnt know him he has nothing against him it just doesnt make any sense
160498 my life is still better than yours lets be honest nik
160499 the regulations are that if you do not have an instrument rating it is not legal to fly
160500 no person may act as pilot in command of a civil aircraft under instrument flight rules or in weather conditions less than the minimums prescribed for visual flight rules flight unless that person holds 1 the appropriate aircraft category class type if required and instrument rating on that persons pilot certificate for any airplane helicopter or powered lift being flown
160501 you need an instrument rating to fly in conditions when instruments are needed
160502 you want to see them but you want them to get enough training so theyre safe
160503 we do that because we have to get the units into theater in time
160504 the priority is getting everyone trained and over there and back within 12 months
160505 only because the families pull together and those of us who have an opportunity to help
160506 nobody wants to know their family has a hole in their roof they cant patch tuition they cant pay
160507 now that theyre at the first army level thats their policy
160508 you wouldnt know if youd have leave until the weekend because they had so much to do
160509 whether theyre done with their training and the time they need to get to kuwait
160510 i was in vietnam and my father and uncles were in world war ii it was a minimum of two weeks leave before deployment i think it had been that way since the civil war
160511 theyre saying its because theyre in the guard but theyre federally activated theyre regular army now they should give them at least a week
160512 its very telling that jersey citys fire department is getting this award
160513 i would never ever id die before id let anything happen to them
160514 animal control only deals with strays but the shelter says
160515 a lot of animals are being turned over as stray under that guise because shelters cant take them
160516 i guess when you come to wits end somethings got to give
160517 i guess its the wrong thing to do but its the lesser evil you could do worse things

160520 it agreement satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
160521 what is even more perplexing is that the constitutional court took this long to decide on whether to uphold the supreme court of appeal ruling or not
160522 the timing of this was very interesting it is made on the eve of the presidents zumas appearance in the pietermaritzburg high court on monday
160523 youre not mad in that picture youre happy as always
160524 we are satisfied that the alleged acts that form the basis of the complaint by judges of this court have had no effect or influence on the consideration by the court of the issues in these cases and in the judgments given
160525 the issues relating to the complaint have accordingly been kept strictly separate from the adjudication process in these cases
160526 our intent is to win the american league central division and ultimately to win another world series championship
160527 adding a player the caliber of ken griffey jr gives us a better chance to realize those goals
160528 griffeys addition gives manager ozzie guillen more flexibility ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months and this gives us the chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try and help us reach the postseason
160529 i hit a lot of fairways to start off and put myself in excellent shape the first few holes
160530 i hit the ball great all day and was able to clean up my putts inside 10 feet whenever youre making all of your putts inside 12 15 feet with the exception of the last hole youre going to play well
160531 this is the best addition that has been made since ive been here
160532 i havent played with him in four years but he is a tremendous teammate he is as good as anyone out there hopefully we can take advantage of it
160533 i had a thought something was going to happen but i had no idea manny was the guy
160534 i was first brought into this around 10 a m and then i cam to the ballpark
160535 manny in the middle of the lineup certainly gets peoples attention
160536 i think hes not only going to be a big plus for us but i think hes going to make guys around him a lot better its not going to be easy in some pitchers minds to go through this lineup
160537 i dont think theres a downside lets just see what happens
160538 it makes you yearn for the dh i just dont know whose playing time it will affect
160539 the talks are progressing well and the negotiators are trying hard to keep to the timeframe of the mou
160540 negotiators have indicated to me that they want to resume negotiations on sunday after breaking on tuesday to report back to their principals
160541 were clearly challenged by the economic conditions affecting many industries particularly as it pertains to our local businesses
160542 when we do youll see just how big a part cnets many global destinations and users play in our newly expanded interactive business and how central it is to achieving our growth goals
160543 we have detected a weakness at the abc stations and espn particularly with autos financials and consumer electronics advertising is only 20 of our revenue so were not as exposed to the ad climate as our media peers we have almost no ad exposure outside the u s
160544 its not a huge opportunity for us since most political ad buying is on local media but it is an opportunity which were taking advantage of and particularly for a demographic thats very interested in this years presidential election
160545 nersas decision grants transnet pipelines an increase in allowable revenue of 7 73 percent
160546 it is not possible to recover revenue from motorists for the previous four months therefore the increase will be recovered over the remaining period of the applicants financial year ending 31 march 2009
160547 the result is that tariff increases for different pipelines vary and range from 0 percent to 10 2 percent
160548 this being the date on which the minister of minerals and energy will implement the monthly price adjustments for petroleum products
160549 unfortunately this application was only received on 27th march 2008
160550 en t pelig konklusjon utelukkende p bakgrunn av mitt eget verk nein gjevang tar fundamentalt feil n r hun hevder at jeg kun snakker for meg selv
160551 alt som blir bestilt og betalt for av nyskrevet opera blir tilsynelatende lagt rett i skuffen det opplever jeg som ekstremt provoserende
160552 n r det er bygget et nydelig nasjonalt operahus s kan man ikke bare servere r mmegr t og vafler det m ogs tilbys noe nytt p innholdssiden
160553 det er t pelig dra en slik konklusjon utelukkende p bakgrunn av sitt eget verk vi har gjort flere avtaler med n tidslibrettister og komponister om nye verk jeg vil p det sterkeste avvise at vi ikke er interessert i v r tids musikk i jakhellns tilfelle legger han bare en libretto til grunn vi har ikke h rt noen musikk til stykket p standene hans er utrolig lettvinte
160554 i en medievirkelighet der fjaseri og informasjonsformidling er like naturlige bestanddeler av underholdningsbransjen trenger ikke landets suverent st rste utgiftspost p kulturbudsjettet halse etter med utdatert underholdningskunst
160555 jeg leverte for et r siden og fikk da beskjed om at min opera ikke hadde noen plass i operaen utover det har jeg ikke f tt noen tilbakemeldinger p arbeidet jeg har gjort
160556 ved hjelp av advokat har han n f tt honorar for stykket
160557 jeg f ler meg tr kket p som skapende kunstner rett og slett
160558 som helhet er vi komponister helt utman vrert vi f ler oss som gissel det ene prosjektet etter det andre g r i vasken milj et er i harnisk
160559 den virkelig store skandalen her er at det blant bevilgningene til operaen er satt av penger til utsmykninger og billedkunst og alt mulig men ikke til produksjon av nye verk
160560 dersom operaen ikke klarer pne seg opp for et bredt register av samtidsopera er det en gedigen fallitterkl ring
160561 satt p spissen opplever jeg at komponisten skriver opera for at de andre profesjonene skal ha noe gj re og som de tillike f r betalt for p timebasis
160562 i am deeply grieved to learn of the sad demise of harkishan singh surjeet he will always be remembered by the countrymen as a statesman and a very good human being may his soul rest in peace i join the nation in paying tribute to the departed soul
160563 id like to do the same guess that makes me a dyke
160564 whose role in history was to lead his people into a perpetual dependence on the welfare state a terrible bondage of body and soul
160565 what better way to reject politics as usual than to elect a maverick like david duke
160566 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
160567 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
160568 i just think hes got a lot of negativity that a lot of people didnt understand the whole situation
160569 he screwed up im not totally taking up for him but sometimes we need to know the whole situation i told him to come back to bastrop because theres not going to be any negative in my office theres no pressure and nobodys pulling at him i just want him to finish up what he started and go play college football
160570 if he has so much trouble qualifying how can we expect him to stay eligible if he ever makes it
160571 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
160572 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
160573 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
160574 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
160575 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
160576 we were seated just a few feet from her she used the expression f word and horses rear a number of times served to him underhand and didnt even try to play the match a shame for her partner who probably would have liked the win in his column
160577 if it was up to the athletes it would have happened a long time ago

160591 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
160592 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
160593 im assuming people will say arsenal are one of the strongest seeded teams and he might have been hoping for someone else but thats what the draw brought us and we get on with it
160594 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid that is why it is better not to look at it we will just take who we get
160595 we just have to improve now to use the two tournaments we play to get physically stronger and better then we will play who we get
160596 we switched from 4 4 2 because it was a big pitch and we wanted to try and keep it tight in the middle and to give ourselves a foothold in the game
160597 if you get sent off for dissent thats an unacceptable red card
160598 if you get sent off for fouling somebody perhaps you can dispute it but dissent is a cheap red card and thats very disappointing
160599 we knew he was a good player and we had plans to deal with that but we put in a very poor performance that wasnt worthy of getting anything from the game
160600 thq is a good company for us to model ourselves on and go after in terms of market share

160610 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
160611 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
160612 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
160613 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
160614 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
160615 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose
160616 strive s to work with developers to correct any issues we discover but when necessary we will act quickly to correct problems and ensure a safe and high quality facebook platform experience for all
160617 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
160618 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
160619 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
160620 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
160621 theyre a private entity theyre not a public utility and theyre not an isp
160622 its perhaps disingenuous for facebook to use the word neutral in that kind of situation because at the end of the day they do hold all the cards on what people can and cannot do on their site
160623 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
160624 olmert told us his goal is to reach an agreement on paper
160625 reach an agreement with the palestinians during the time he has left
160626 any agreement he reaches with the palestinians wont be a personal agreement and he will make sure that the new kadima leadership is briefed and on board
160627 at this time of change in the government we must not reach agreements on the core issues in negotiations with the palestinians
160628 anything that is decided now is very problematic because it is happening before the change in the government and against the background of instability on the palestinian side
160629 the new rates which have already become effective from july 16 are aimed at attracting more climbers to all mountains including mount everest even during the off season
160630 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf

160632 we continue to be an investor in zagat survey our firm has a long term investment horizon
160633 want to see us develop the company as aggressively as we can
160634 in five years youll see us continue to grow geographies to add more content in verticals we cover and add additional leisure activities
160635 the coach has proven that he is strong and hard he is always on top of the players and very attentive in training
160636 he said he has faith in me i am ready to carry on at bar a if nothing happens before august 31 ill still be here
160637 its not easy but i am a strong character and i only worry about football matters i just have to think about getting into the strongest form possible
160638 we are only thinking about ourselves we all know that we have a final to play in the first leg of the champions league
160639 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
160640 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
160641 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
160642 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
160643 but the press they have distorted it ronaldo is not a slave
160644 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
160645 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favour to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave in football there is too much modern slavery
160646 we have nothing to say fifa is not going to intervene let it be as it is now
160647 compared to credit monitoring and similar services a credit freeze provides superior protection because it is the only proactive tool that stops new account fraud before it starts
160648 i walked around with my head down thinking i cant vote
160649 they feel like theyre still in prison because there are still so many roadblocks and impediments in front of them to keep them from being fully in society
160650 we dont have any money and we dont have any employees that we can really ask to do that
160651 i planned on doing it anyway but i didnt know theyd be able to help me do it right there
160652 if the desire was truly to give these folks a new start and to truly get these folks on the voting rolls i dont know a good reason not to do that
160653 if there was the political will for it we could have that now
160654 its not like somebodys going to knock on your door and say hey come get your rights back
160655 it will be a night of the unexpected people would be entertained to the maximum but they should not also forget to donate generously to the change charity even though the night is gonna be about me we should also remember our young ones who are less privileged in society
160656 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
160657 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day

160662 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
160663 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare

160667 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
160668 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
160669 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
160670 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
160671 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
160672 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
160673 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
160674 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
160675 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
160676 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
160677 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
160678 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
160679 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
160680 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
160681 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day

160691 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
160692 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
160693 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
160694 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
160695 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
160696 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
160697 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case

160699 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state

160701 the international olympic committee and the organizing committee of the beijing olympic games should fulfill their commitment to full media freedom and provide immediate uncensored internet access at olympic media venues censorship of the internet at the games is compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the olympic values
160702 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
160703 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china

160944 if china follows suit with 5 of their foreign allocation into real estate we are at nearly 25 billion if korea puts a third of their 10 billion allocated to alternative investment in real estate that brings the total of fresh real estate capital coming to play in the short term up to 28 billion

161085 poverty is unacceptably high in nigeria but the alarming and persisting level of poverty in nigeria is a phenomenon in the north
161086 the future of the north lies in our hands and we should today begin to shape her destiny
161087 we also need to examine the issues that led to de industrialisation of the north whereby many of the northern industries have been closed down with attendant consequences for the social security of our people

161106 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
161107 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
161108 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
161109 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
161110 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
161111 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
161112 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
161113 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
161114 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
161115 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
161116 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
161117 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
161118 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
161119 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
161120 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
161121 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are
161122 begin a new chapter in my life i am eager to pursue new civic professional and personal goals
161123 i have an inclination that it might cause a little confusion
161124 im interested in how it all breaks out i dont know if i want to get involved in a special election or not
161125 they hollered at us we ignored them i guess they decided to settle things a different way
161126 there was no reason for them to come after us at all
161127 im for anybody who comes up with anything that will produce energy for this country
161128 meanwhile im not going to say park your car we all need to deal with this as it comes but to get there we cant just shut down what were doing now we have to keep it going we have to find the oil while we find the other solutions i dont think people should suffer while we look for other solutions

161171 theyre worth saving for the next generation we dont need any more parking lots
161172 this board is going to make one of the most important decisions ever if you tear these buildings down youll have the domino effect
161173 people are concerned about spending village money to rebuild buildings without knowing what its going to cost if they do this is small town usa whos going to buy them
161174 its going to take 85 000 to stabilize them 150 000 to put new roofs on and then another 150 000 minimum to finish the inside three local contractors have looked at them and say its a cost prohibitive project the north side buildings need to be removed the buildings got a hole in the roof and the second floor is falling into the first floor
161175 what we dont want to see happen is someone come in and buy a building and try to flip it to make a thousand bucks
161176 any sale after stabilization would have contingencies on completing interior work with a time frame
161177 after the second or third meeting we decided on tearing them down but we needed to know what it would cost
161178 we learned a lot about free standing versus common walls liabilities and rules and regulations that applied to government owned buildings a demolition veteran wouldnt put pencil to paper but said 500 000 maybe more to tear down all the buildings
161179 we look at hundreds of buildings a year across illinois
161180 it might be only to recommend a paint scheme but often it is to determine structural soundness
161181 there are tax incentives and grant money available for rehabilitation projects to tear them town is a waste of history and money
161182 i retired from the chicago area and lived in a place that wasnt bad but every time you wanted to go somewhere you had to fight traffic this is a beautiful place
161183 we have to remain attractive if we want to attract more people and business we cant do that by tearing down more buildings
161184 part of getting that district was to build new homes and bring young families to save our schools
161185 im a business owner i think it would be wonderful to save what we have but we cant forget we have to improve growth of new residents with children

161196 we tried to get him in but it didnt happen and we moved on but i would like to go back in for him because i know he can live at this level and we know he enjoys scoring at portman road
161197 he is someone i know could take us to where we want to go
161198 it was strange because as soon as i joined twente i knew we had the draw coming up
161199 i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
161200 on one hand its very very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting
161201 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest
161202 obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult
161203 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us
161204 this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams
161205 it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
161206 kita lihat ekspor ke pakistan sebagai hal penting kita mencermati bahwa dibanding tahun lalu ekspor kita dalam 6 bulan terakhir turun sampai hampir 350 000 ton ke pakistan jadi kita lost rugi dalam pendapatan hampir sekitar rp 800 miliar ini terjadi karena kebijakan dari pakistan yang memberikan perlakuan yang berbeda untuk indonesia dan malaysia
161207 jadi bea masuknya flat sehingga harga malaysia di pakistan lebih murah dari indonesia sebesar us 17 per ton
161208 karena pakistan menjadi pintu masuk bagi negara tan tan lainnya yaitu tans brothers seperti afghanistan kirgistan itu cukup besar permintaannya kita sedang coba selesaikan mudah mudahan agustus sudah selesai pembahasannya sehingga misi dagang bisa dikirim ke sana sehingga kita bisa dapatkan langkah langkah strategis untuk mengatasinya ujungnya nanti tidak ada lagi pembedaan antara indonesia dan malaysia indonesia juga nanti akan dapat diskon
161209 pakistan kita mau garap segera karena kita ketahui malaysia sudah bea masuknya lebih baik padahal kita sebelumnya pemasok utama dari pakistan
161210 kita akan negosiasi dengan pakistan pada tahun ini untuk mendapatkan lebih baik dari bea masuk malaysia rencananya agustus kita lakukan

161217 global handset shipments rose 15 annually to 297 million units during the second quarter despite much economic gloom handset sales remain robust in emerging markets and the worldwide growth rate is in fact higher than it was at any time during 2007
161218 motorola exceeded expectations and held off lg to maintain the third spot in our global vendor rankings during the second quarter of 2008 motorolas decline in shipments at minus 21 annually was its slowest rate since the first quarter of 2007 these represent tentative signs of recovery and if motorola can slash costs and refresh its handset portfolio over the coming months then a return to profitability in 2009 is possible

161223 i have to turn the pressure into power and make a good start
161224 i was unable to finish with a medal in athens my target is to succeed with all six lifts and if i do that i think results will come
161225 i can feel the atmosphere of the olympics and that this is a big deal

161231 it is quite eerie for any thinking person to watch how everything turns into darkness in broad daylight
161232 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
161233 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
161234 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
161235 but i didnt turn out to have any special genius so i cant say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me
161236 it speaks for itself that we did not carry out this reshuffle with a view to raising the public support ratings in preparation for the dissolution
161237 our cabinet aims to figure out ways to realize policy issues that face us and to tackle issues
161238 we are not carrying out politics or doing work as cabinet members for the sake of ratings
161239 it has been 10 months since i took office and during this time i have been working based on the idea of promoting a government administration that places emphasis on peoples lives and stands at the level of the general public

161245 calls for everyone to have an open mind and to come to conclusion only after a dispassionate and objective appreciation of evidence
161246 the judiciary should be above suspicion if it will be effective in dispensing justice we cannot have one branch of government being diminished by scandals like this
161247 i am sure the sc will take an immediate cognizance and dig into it
161248 this is at the heart of trust and confidence in government if the people do not trust the judiciary who else can we trust
161249 sc should swiftly step in act decisively in order to restore peoples faith in the judiciary
161250 the sc must show no hesitation whatsoever in pursuing this controversy the entire judiciarys reputation is tarnished by this scandal and the swiftness within which the sc responds will determine whether the damage is temporary and minimal or if it will be massive and irreparable

161266 prove the ability to ventilate by mask before giving a muscle relaxant
161267 the assumption by both the editorial and the letter to the editor is that the inability to ventilate the patient will not result in a change in clinical approach and that in most cases the administration of a neuromuscular blocking drug will occur anyway what the authors failed to consider is that based on the ability or inability to ventilate the selected neuromuscular blocking drug may change for example instead of giving vecuronium one might opt to use succinylcholine for more rapid onset even if face mask ventilation were successful one might elect a more rapidly acting agent if there were considerable difficulty in obtaining air exchange although this does not invalidate the arguments presented it does suggest that more complete consideration of the process might lead to different conclusions than those presented
161268 the original pre catalyst will then be inspected for evidence of damage to the catalyst substrate if damage is present the vehicle engine will be replaced
161269 the transport canada agent knew about the recall he recited it to me and said they could not enforce it its up to nissan canada to force the dealership to fix my car
161270 but my 2002 taurus has only 64 000 km on it and i keep it in top mechanical shape
161271 when you go back to the dealer you may be able to make an arrangement with him
161272 they must know there is something wrong with these damn springs considering it didnt take me five minutes to discover the extent of the problem
161273 the law requires only a notice be issued in canada which is in contrast to the u s where the manufacturer is legally bound to make the repair at no cost to the consumer
161274 a notice of defect is issued and the manufacturer has to notify owners they dont have to do anything else
161275 the motor vehicle safety act requires that vehicle tire and child restraint manufacturers or importers notify transport canada dealers and the owners of their products about any safety problems
161276 given the consumer driven environment we have the manufacturers are motivated to provide good customer relations so they make the repairs at no cost but they also add provisos usually related to time and mileage
161277 when a spring breaks and punctures a tire theres a terrible noise and a lot of flapping rubber but it doesnt affect the stability of the vehicle
161278 ford had concluded that this is not a safety issue and id have to agree
161279 nissan covers the catalytic converter defect under a recall but not the eventual consequence which is an oil burning engine beginning after 80 000 km
161280 my experience has been that manufacturers have always followed through on a recall order
161281 most companies will err on the side of caution significant lawsuits are the fear

161299 what i said is slavery is with the young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old young boys and bring them to the big clubs this is my expression this is modern slavery
161300 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it ronaldo is not a slave
161301 cristiano ronaldo and manchester united and real madrid they can solve this problem for the time being we have nothing to say
161302 this principle has been made by the fifa congress in the year 1988
161303 it has worked for 20 years and nobody has ever put into question that the player under 23 shall be released
161304 now we have problems with two clubs in germany and one in spain but you have seen that the two brazilian players rafinha and diego they will play tonight here they are with their team

161307 when they brought him to the hospital his blood pressure flatlined and so they took him directly to surgery
161308 it is extraordinarily distressing that someone would do that to an elderly man and two children
161309 they had to be coming from across there because the rain came down all of a sudden and when they was coming across the street either they had the light or that person had no visual the one that was driving hit em
161310 the rain had just started and it was raining real hard and the visibility was really really bad at the time so apparently he was trying to get back to the building out the rain from my understanding the car came through and just wiped them out
161311 when i got to the window i saw the cab driver carrying the little kid towards his car putting him in the back seat
161312 i was just with them two days in a row i was with them
161313 he was out here barbecuing with his grandkids yesterday we had a good conversation good talk
161314 they should have given some assistance they should turn themselves in now

161318 durante as minhas primeiras olimp adas em 2000 tive a oportunidade de acompanhar as competi es de nata o e badminton foram grandes momentos
161319 o edmundo n o m dico para falar de mim
161320 we are following our plan of preparations for the premier league season
161321 im really glad that i have a chance to test my team against serious opponents ahead of the its start
161322 we came here to prepare the best possible way for the season opening match with portsmouth its my dominating idea for the moment
161323 we played three good games in china but those were not strong games here we will face much more strong opponents
161324 we will start against against the hosts lokomotiv and then will face either milan or sevilla its very useful experience now im already sure about 85 percents of my first line up i hope after this tournament ill be completely sure about it
161325 the feedback i received from the teams that competed last year was that the organisation was excellent and the teams participating were of a very high standard
161326 his promotions were not bringing in a lot of dough he was hard up on cash
161327 my charm is so contagious vaccines have been created for it
161328 he said i have to report to work then ill come back
161329 the cashier took it in good faith that since he was a police officer hed be back
161330 it is fundamental that these legislative elections are conducted in a satisfactory manner and in line with international standards

161333 we would obviously consult with the ecb before making any final decision
161334 i havent seen the offer yet but we are part of the ecb and wed have to go through the consultation with them
161335 from our point of view weve got extremely good relations with both the bcci board of control for cricket in india and the ecb and were excited about the fact the tournament is going ahead and well have to wait and see what happens

161338 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it
161339 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
161340 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
161341 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
161342 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should
161343 nobody is going to protect the natural world unless they understand it
161344 the results reinforce the idea that many children dont spend enough time playing in the green outdoors and enjoying wildlife something older generations might have taken for granted
161345 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix
161346 when jesus saw her mary weeping he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved
161347 this illness does not lead to death rather it is for gods glory
161348 the dead man came out his hands and feet bound
161349 so the chief priests and the pharisees said what are we to do this man is performing many signs they gave orders that anyone who knew where jesus was should let them know so that they might arrest him
161350 if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation

161359 37 people didnt have anything to throw at him 37 people couldnt have over powered one guy with a knife
161360 isnt this the same mentality that allowed 2 or 3 idiots with box cutters to take out the twin towers
161361 they all watched and the bus driver had to ask a trucker to help him keep the guy in the bus
161362 no handguns allowed in canada we know but no woman had a purse to bonk him on the head
161363 no one bothered to throw a can of diet coke at the guys head who was on the bus the old ladies home and gardening society
161364 winnipeg is only a few miles from the u s border
161365 the idea was to get as close to the u s as he could if not get into the u s then engage in the attack in front of a busload of people this was another act of radical islamic terrorism on north american soil
161366 the international olympic committee and the organizing committee of the beijing olympic games should fulfill their commitment to full media freedom and provide immediate uncensored internet access at olympic media venues censorship of the internet at the games is compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the olympic values
161367 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
161368 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china

161371 the way were doing it now with our next project were starting much earlier with the writing weve got a writer on board and were spending a lot of time on the shop floor in the studio with the designers including the level designers working out the narrative flow the locations
161372 i think its absolutely essential last time round we didnt really involve our designers in the process so the story became a nuisance to what they were trying to do which was create gameplay now weve involved them all together theres a much bigger appreciation of the gameplay and story
161373 because its such a visual medium its the same format as film i think it makes sense to use some of the same conventions but we are at a point where can start to break some of those conventions i feel like progress is a little bit slow its something we want to do in our next project push a little bit further i dont think cut scenes are going to go away

161379 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
161380 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
161381 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
161382 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
161383 theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
161384 obviously that was too obvious so he replaced the last sentence with
161385 but isnt it great if you dont because it means god has something better for you dont you love it when god makes decisions for you who knows you and whats good for you better than him your father

161406 the estimate for wholesale price based inflation on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter of 2008 09 is projected to be 9 2 per cent

161414 i let myself be known before i understood myself but had i understood what i was doing i couldnt have accomplished it
161415 no no you still dont understand of course its a terrible burden to carry around and you must feel like a murderer but there are worse things
161416 yes really and im almost glad that you refuse to believe me certain events which have actually happened are horrible but what is more horrible still is what hasnt happened what has never existed
161417 what is a normal man a man who has never committed a disgraceful act maybe but has he never had uncontrollable thoughts perhaps he hasnt but perhaps something a phantasm rose up from somewhere within him ten or thirty years ago something which he suppressed and then forgot about which he doesnt fear since he knows he will never allow it to develop and so lead to any action on his part and now suddenly in broad daylight he comes across this thing this thought embodied riveted to him indestructible he wonders where he is do you know where he is

161421 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
161422 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
161423 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
161424 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
161425 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
161426 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year

161603 human latency is not the time it takes to change communication channels it is the delay in a business process that results when human interaction or intervention is required
161604 human latency is the time that a business process is pending or delayed while waiting for the humans who are required to act on the process the important thing to the enterprise and to the enterprises customers or constituents is that the process be completed
161605 many many examples exist of technology overcoming human latency how about ivr systems and automatic teller machines and web sites so that the customer or constituent does not even have to wait how about e mail voice mail or texting so that a dialogue can occur without waiting for both or several parties to be available for a phone call simultaneous by definition

161643 his contribution in setting the countrys political course was immense
161644 he was a great strategist a man with great political acumen and as one could see at the time of the united front government and also at the beginning of the upa government he played an important role
161645 i have come here to pay respect to my leader who fought for the common people he was a leader of the masses his demise is a great loss

161647 important role in making the cpi m the largest contingent of the left movement in the country surjeet absorbed marxism leninism by sheer dent of self study and learning from experience
161648 he always stressed the fundamental importance of critically examining the partys ideological and political positions on the basis of marxism
161649 the most authoritative spokesman for the left and democratic forces in the country
161650 he worked tirelessly for the defence of democratic and secular values and to see that india maintained its non aligned and independent foreign policy his views were sought and his advice heard with respect in political circles

161663 i tried to cut a few wires with pliers but the thing will not come out immediately i asked one of my officers to get scissors and cut the wire later i removed the battery and the detonator
161664 perhaps this could have made those carrying the other bombs this was the first one drop them wherever they found it to be safe

161679 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
161680 its a good deal for pittsburgh they got four good players
161681 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
161682 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
161683 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us

161697 these people who want to destroy or besmirch the unity of italy should be ashamed of themselves
161698 they have no idea what it has achieved or what it cost to bring about
161699 it sends out an important signal that sicily wants to liberate itself from a symbol of centralism who brought the island nothing but harm
161700 i ask myself whether we shouldnt follow suit and tear down such street signs in northern italy

161705 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
161706 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
161707 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
161708 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
161709 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

161720 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
161721 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 percent
161722 it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by lufthansa and ver di is an important message to our customers as well as our staff and to germany as an economic base
161723 every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
161724 is however provisional on pay parity for cabin crew staff and pending agreement between lufthansa ver di and ufo the flight attendants union
161725 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
161726 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
161727 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
161728 you have value on the ground more than you spent
161729 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
161730 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
161731 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
161732 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
161733 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
161734 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
161735 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
161736 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
161737 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
161738 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
161739 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
161740 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
161741 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
161742 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
161743 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
161744 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
161745 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
161746 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
161747 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
161748 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
161749 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it

161947 your tongue in my mouth trying to keep the words from coming out you didnt care to know who else may have been you before

161957 i define money or currency as an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange its therefore not a thing its only an agreement like a marriage like a business deal and most of the time its done unconsciously nobodys polled about whether you want to use dollars were living in this money world like fish in water taking it completely for granted
161958 there are many new agreements being made within communities as to the kind of medium of exchange they are willing to accept
161959 in britain you can use frequent flier miles as currency
161960 there are about 300 or 400 private currency systems in japan to pay for any care for the elderly that isnt covered by the national health insurance
161961 heres how they work lets say that on my street lives an elderly gentleman who is handicapped and cannot go shopping for himself i do the shopping for him i help him with food preparation i help him with the ritual bath which is very important in japan
161962 for this help i get credits i put those credits in a savings account and when im sick i can have other people provide such services for me or i can electronically send my credits to my mother who lives on the other side of the country and somebody takes care of her

162156 the justice of this case is that parties to this suit should maintain the status quo so that the res substance will not be destroyed umaru said
162157 the res is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants on august 14 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications he added
162158 this order is not capable of being obeyed because this court cannot sit as an appellate court on the judgement of the international court of justice at the hague

162166 the launch of the chapters at zonal levels is meant to speed up coverage of the entire country in order to facilitate a well coordinated effective response against the epidemic
162167 i would like to use this opportunity to also call on the national agency for the control of aids and ogther donor agencies to always assist wives of state governors directly while preparing for the launching of the state chapters of nawoca i would like to reaffirm my resolve and commitment to continue contributing my quota using the instrumentality of nawoca at all levels in the struggle against hiv aids

162179 the withdrawal of subsidy on petroleum products is going to increase the already poor plight of the common man as a result of the likely spiral effect of such a withdrawal on the economy
162180 the federal government should therefore continue to subside the petroleum products from the proceeds of the excess crude account
162181 the controversy relating to the activities of the committee is symptomatic of the nigerian attitude of frustrating any probe or investigation of wrong doing it is hoped that the very laudable effort of the house of reps will not be completely wasted as a result of undue controversies

162331 what i would like to say to the holy father is that at present damascus is the capital of arab culture and at the same time the capital of the year of st paul
162332 i will be exceedingly happy if the holy father decides to accept our invitation to visit syria in this year
162333 culture of the spirit whether christian or muslim confers on humanity its moral dimension
162334 the vatican might play a role in planting the flower of peace in the middle east
162335 deep down among religious intellectuals there is no quarrel but dialogue and discussion
162336 and i hope that the holy father will play a fundamental part in the peace of the world
162337 speaks of the level of the figure of the pope today in the world how is it possible to be absent from where he is
162338 the presence of the journalists in these two weeks at tranquil bressanone is one more proof of the anticipation for everything that the pope does or says an anticipation that doesnt end even when the situation brings discouragement
162339 there is little to spy on from the other side of the wall of the black canvas they have put up to protect benedicts walks in the garden of the seminary but we are prepared for whatever could be necessary
162340 but when he disembarked he found that a large crowd was waiting for him when he disembarked and saw the vast crowd his heart was moved with pity for them and he cured their sick
162341 when it was evening the disciples approached him and said this is a deserted place and it is already late dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
162342 jesus said to them there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves but they said to him five loaves and two fish are all we have here
162343 then he said bring them here to me and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples who in turn gave them to the crowds
162344 they all ate and were satisfied and they picked up the fragments left over twelve wicker baskets full those who ate were about five thousand men not counting women and children
162345 taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples

162349 i appreciate that were looking at a tough trading year ahead
162350 but is making it more difficult to do business south of the border or making scotland a less attractive less convenient destination for uk tourists going to make conditions better or worse

162355 we dont know yet where the site is and without that we dont know how much cable we need
162356 without that we cant even get the company to talk to us because they are so busy until we know what we want they wont talk to us but we think were going to have that answer in the next six weeks
162357 the facility could be either right on the shore or it could be in halifax
162358 we think it should go right on the shore were now starting to look at landfall and our view is to have it on the waters edge so when people come its all right there
162359 now we have the knowledge and information that will allow us to understand exactly what is going on there with geology currents and biology so we can make the right decisions
162360 we still have a lot more to do but this is a glimpse at where we sit in the geological world
162361 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
162362 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
162363 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
162364 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack

162368 every 1 000 years one of my kind mates with one of your kind to produce a multispecies child that child the golden child controls all of history on both our planets for the next ten centuries its very important if we dont produce the next golden child both of our worlds will be thrown into chaos
162369 because relations between the kinds is very well painful its for your own good really all you have to do is stay here for the next four months my kind will send a crew of servants to tend to your every need then well release our child to the heavens and harmony will reign in both our worlds for another 1 000 years
162370 if another one of your kind touches her before she gives birth all is lost
162371 thats exactly my intention our worlds have been controlled by the golden child for far too long grugian
162372 its time to set our worlds free of the tyranny of the golden child grugian i am going to take xinni home where well raise your child as a normal person none of us will answer the golden child ever again come xinni

162378 there is no doubt in my mind that the global economy will deteriorate further into recession and oil demand will suffer accordingly

162390 if the liberal congresswoman could get as energized about saving our once great republic
162391 the vast majority of our politicos from both major parties do not even seem to know what kind of country the united states was designed to be
162392 the war on terror is an absolute fraud i said this over two years ago and it remains more obviously true two years hence it is a war designed specifically to mask the injustices and inequalities which afflict millions of americans by aggravating and amplifying the injustices and inequalities inflicted upon millions of non americans its very existence represents continuous and ever expanding victory for only the most vicious opportunistic and hateful elements among humanity who will impose upon us tragedy upon tragedy and terror upon terror until we break cleanly and completely from the rotted chains of mindless fealty to false national leaders and forge links with those abroad whose friendships we have forgone for far too long
162393 i am overwhelmingly pleased that the rand corporation has concluded that the war on terror is a hoax and that military efforts to deal with terrorism have always been ineffective
162394 it is also not surprising that the rand corporation further suggests that a second aspect of a counterterrorism effort would minimize the use of us military force
162395 although it should have been obvious many years ago i am nevertheless pleased at the rand corporation has finally concluded that terrorist organizations end either because of operations carried out by police and intelligence agencies or because they join the political process not because of military operations the terrorism of timothy mcveigh was brought to an end through police action not by bombing new york his home state the terrorism in northern ireland ended with a political solution showing the futility of years of military action
162396 should carry a warning label about their dangerous effects on liberty
162397 the issue isnt about public health it is about giving the fda new powers to regulate a private industry when really we should be moving to privatize the fda
162398 tobacco education is not a problem in the united states
162399 both private advocacy groups and cigarette manufacturers spend millions on educational programs we dont need the government obtaining new powers to regulate a personal choice by millions of americans to light up a cigarette when the risk is clearly known yes smoking is dangerous but government power is even more dangerous
162400 government should have no role in helping to make that decision
162401 and one that an individual should make for himself as well as pay for the consequences himself

162406 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
162407 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
162408 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
162409 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
162410 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
162411 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
162412 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
162413 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end

162421 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
162422 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
162423 these results demonstrate that ampk ppar delta pathway can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training adaptation or even to increase endurance without exercise

162436 wir haben das f r eine gute vereinbarung gehalten und wir waren bereit sie zu akzeptieren
162437 ich bin weiterhin berzeugt dass dies der richtige deal ist
162438 froh dass es in der volkspartei spd viele meinungen gibt
162439 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
162440 wir machen alle fehler wer ohne s nde ist werfe den ersten stein
162441 wahlen gewinnen wir nur gemeinsam wolfgang clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
162442 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht
162443 sein rauswurf w re ein symbol daf r dass diejenigen die einen n chternen realistischen wirtschaftsfreundlichen kurs vertreten in der spd keine politische heimat mehr haben
162444 was seine wirtschafts und ordnungspolitischen vorstellungen angeht gibt es viele bereinstimmungen mit der union das ist richtig aber ob sein herz jetzt f r die union schl gt das muss herr clement selbst entscheiden
162445 so wichtig ist wolfgang clement nicht mehr dass wir wochenlang ber ihn streiten sollten
162446 its always great to win that first league encounter and get three points on the board especially in front of our own fans
162447 in the latter stages of last season we turned palmerston into a fortress and i want it to be like that again
162448 i know the airdrie manager kenny black very well and im sure hed love to come down and surprise us
162449 the opening league match is always a hard one to predict but airdrie have a lot of new faces in their squad and well be facing somewhat of an unknown quantity
162450 id like to think we could improve on last seasons fourth place but there will be some pretty tough competition out there
162451 i saw st johnstone play burnley and they looked pretty good they have a fair squad which gives them lots of options
162452 dundee of course can never be ruled out and personally i think it could be tighter than ever at the top this time around
162453 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
162454 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
162455 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
162456 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom

162509 hes a very skilful and exciting player and hopefully its a signing that will excite our fans
162510 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
162511 hes a talented kid and the fact that weve only managed to get him out on loan initially says it all because his club would have preferred to keep him
162512 so well see how it goes its always hard when you come to a new country
162513 i dont want to put too much expectation on the lad because it will take him time to settle in but we believe weve got a decent player
162514 i am very happy because i am going to be playing competitive football
162515 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
162516 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
162517 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
162518 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
162519 we the 100 national and international ngo members of acbar express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
162520 but we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering
162521 it is imperative that they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
162522 especially the increasing use of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and the use of civilian property from which to launch attacks
162523 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
162524 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
162525 the ioc co ordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
162526 in the last few days its been obvious that there have been sites blocked on the internet
162527 i have received unqualified assurances from president of the ioc jacques rogge and the chairman of the co ordination commission hein verbruggen that we have not shifted our position
162528 already we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with non censored reporting of the games
162529 we are in the process of getting websites which were previously blocked unblocked
162530 there will be sites blocked that have to do with pornography or where in the opinion of the national government are sites which are subversive or against national interest and thats normal in most countries in the world

162538 daremos a los medios de comunicaci n libertad total para informar cuando vengan a china estamos convencidos de que la concesi n de los juegos a china no s lo promover nuestra econom a sino que tambi n mejorar todos los problemas sociales incluidos la educaci n la salud y los derechos humanos
162539 nos satisface que el coi reconozca de su papel en materia de derechos humanos pero dada la realidad actual nos sorprende su confianza en que los medios de comunicaci n extranjeros podr n informar libremente y en que no habr censura de internet
162540 y el coi debe pronunciarse cuando las autoridades violan los principios ol mpicos generales
162541 adem s los dirigentes mundiales que asistan a los juegos deben alzar p blicamente la voz en favor de los derechos humanos en china y deben apoyar a los activistas individuales de derechos humanos de china si no lo hacen transmitir n el mensaje de que es aceptable que un gobierno sea anfitri n de los juegos ol mpicos en una atm sfera de represi n y persecuci n

162544 jim was unable to hold me or the children and every move caused him terrible pain we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation
162545 they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of jims scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place
162546 now jim is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time his scrotum should recover completely

162549 cantabria est dispuesta a modular su posici n para favorecer un acuerdo un nime en el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera y esperamos que el resto tambi n lo hagan porque todos tenemos en nuestros estatutos de autonom a exigencias que afectan al modelo de financiaci n
162550 si s lo se ponen encima de la mesa posiciones cerradas no habr acuerdo lo que ser a malo porque el modelo actual no da respuesta financiera adecuada
162551 pero el ltimo d as los concesionarios aceleraron las matriculaciones de kil metro 0
162552 el canal de rent a car descendi m s de la mitad en los ltimos d as del mes debido principalmente a las cancelaciones de las compa as de alquiler por orden de las centrales y por la falta de demanda
162553 los cambios propuestos podr an incrementar sobremanera el coste del capital en toda europa y tener efectos perjudiciales m s all del sector financiero
162554 no necesitamos una regulaci n que agrave la ralentizaci n la norma del 10 por ciento es exactamente lo que no necesitamos
162555 hay una tensi n provocada especialmente por el estatuto de autonom a de catalu a que marca una tendencia y que en el caso de extremadura no estamos dispuestos a asumir como es garantizar s lo la financiaci n para los servicios fundamentales y no para el resto
162556 la principal preocupaci n de extremadura es que la suficiencia para las comunidades aut nomas y la igualdad para todos los espa oles debe garantizarse en todos los casos y no s lo en los servicios fundamentales
162557 el frente com n no es el camino sino que cada comunidad aut noma exponga su posici n y que la confronte de manera transparente y abierta
162558 es una actividad m s para exponer su posici n sobre el modelo de unas regiones con ciertas caracter sticas
162559 no estamos en ning n frente com n sino en una reuni n en la que se ha invitado a comunidades para que expongan su visi n del modelo de financiaci n
162560 de manera directa y aprender tambi n del resto de ponentes
162561 no tenemos la intenci n de tomar una participaci n importante en europa que no cumpliese nuestros criterios de inversi n y en particular no tenemos intenci n de tomar una participaci n significativa en iberdrola

162565 s lo despu s de eso pasaremos a la fase de negociaci n final con dos o tres de esos operadores internacionales
162566 estamos hablando de un conjunto de inversiones muy importantes para estos pr ximos tres a os

162572 animados en estos ltimos a os por una coyuntura econ mica favorable y un turismo en alza
162573 se considera asimismo b sica la uni n del oeste de la pen nsula por un nuevo corredor vertical de ferrocarril convencional ruta de la plata que una las redes norte noroeste galicia y asturias con el resto del oeste as como con el sur extremadura y andaluc a
162574 porque con el constante encarecimiento del precio de los carburantes y mayor que lo ser por el gran consumo de los pa ses asi ticos emergentes nos hace pensar en la necesidad de una alternativa al transporte por carretera que alivie los costes energ ticos mejore nuestro medio ambiente y evite un posible colapso de nuestros abastecimientos
162575 porque de las medidas que se consideraban necesarias para el periodo 2004 2008 en este caso ya se ha perdido demasiado tiempo el deterioro econ mico del oeste no ha mejorado y la convergencia deseada no se ha producido
162576 contemple la posibilidad de concesi n de explotaci n para cumplir la medida n 69 lo antes posible
162577 contribuci n a la conciencia social y a la participaci n ciudadana en la defensa de sus derechos
162578 lo que est haciendo la junta de castilla y le n al privatizar la gesti n del centro de emergencia es lavarse las manos conocida es la pol tica de la administraci n auton mica de privatizar todos los servicios y en este caso la junta delega su responsabilidad ante el problema de la violencia machista en la cruz roja
162579 la red asistencial para v ctimas de violencia machista debe ser asumida por la propia administraci n auton mica generando as puestos de trabajo p blico por tanto denunciamos a la junta por su irresponsabilidad a la hora de abordar un asunto tan serio como es la violencia contra las mujeres y su incapacidad para llevar a cabo una buena gestion y dando alternativas a las mujeres que tienen que utilizar lo que ellas creen son servicios publicos desgraciadamente en manos privadas
162580 ordenanza municipal sobre protecci n de la convivencia ciudadana y prevenci n de actuaciones antisociales
162581 el psoe tiene inter s en evitar que los ciudadanos se organicen desde la base
162582 ordenanza municipal sobre protecci n de la convivencia ciudadana y prevenci n de actuaciones antisociales
162583 esta ordenanza es desproporcionada injusta y represiva la prohibici n de acciones informativas como el reparto de d pticos en la calle o las pegadas de carteles suponen cercenar el nico medio del que dispone el movimiento ciudadano para expresarse y organizarse
162584 el silencio c mplice del psoe seg n interpreta el pce indica que el partido socialista de salamanca tiene un alto inter s en evitar que los ciudadanos se organicen desde la base para no tener cr ticas desde la izquierda
162585 pretendemos que salamanca tenga una ordenanza que asegure la limpieza y seguridad de los bienes p blicos no una ley del silencio contra sindicatos movimientos vecinales y asociaciones ciudadanas
162586 a lo mejor el pp pretende que los ciudadanos participemos mediante mensajes de m vil
162587 a lo mejor el concejal pretende que los ciudadanos participemos escribiendo a su correo personal o que le mandemos mensajes de m vil
162588 restringe al m ximo las posibilidades de participaci n del ciudadano pretende controlar la vida interna de las asociaciones y busca que la participaci n est abierta tan s lo a sectores econ micos privados
162589 es decir el ayuntamiento de salamanca pierde un considerable valor patrimonial de terreno p blico a cambio de un terreno de f tbol de hierba artificial y unos vestuarios
162590 el pleno del ayuntamiento es decir los grupos municipales del psoe y del pp se han comportando hoy como si el terreno municipal fuera de su propiedad para salvar la situaci n econ mica de tres individuos concretos que se cubren en primer lugar tras los dos grupos municipales del ayuntamiento y ahora una vez concedida la permuta tras una sociedad o testaferro denominado inversiones y desarrollos
162591 tanto el psoe como el pp a los que tanto les preocupa la pol tica deportiva deber an preocuparse de dotar de recursos e infraestructuras suficientes para promocionar el deporte en los j venes y su promoci n a los equipos profesionales realizar convenios con los colegios e institutos de la ciudad para poder aprovechar sus instalaciones con la finalidad de que los ni os ni as y j venes salamantinos puedan practicar deporte fuera de los horarios escolares de modo que la uds por ejemplo logre tener en un futuro inmediato una buena cantera de futbolistas de la ciudad esto s que es una competencia pol tica del ayuntamiento y no especular con el terreno municipal que es de todos los salmantinos
162592 suficiente para mantener la capacidad competitiva de los operadores alternativos
162593 estamos obligados a contribuir juntos a dimensionar la crisis del trd para que el gobierno no mire a otro lado
162594 nuestro objetivo es la defensa de un servicio p blico esencial que critiquemos su desastroso funcionamiento no significa que lo queramos vilipendiar sino justo lo contario que defendemos una gesti n de calidad para un eje estrat gico como lo es el ferrocarril
162595 desde izquierda unida salamanca hemos decidido afrontar la situaci n con decencia y perseverancia preguntando directamente a los responsables pidiendo informes sobre la situaci n y transmiti ndoles las quejas de los sufridos viajeros
162596 las iniciativas y preguntas parlamentarias presentadas por gaspar llamazares y joan josep nuet van en ese sentido una labor encomiable mal que le pese a algunos que es justa necesaria pero no suficiente
162597 que sirva para emplazar a todos los concejales del ayuntamiento de salamanca tanto del equipo de gobierno como de la oposici n a apoyar una estrategia de acci n conjunta encaminada a la consecuci n de un servicio p blico de ferrocarril digno de tal nombre as como que se asuman las responsabilidades oportunas por el desastre continuo al que nos hemos visto sometidos durante tanto tiempo
162598 entre una oposici n desilusionada que piensa que haga lo que haga no va a ganar y un equipo municipal acomodado que piensa por el contrario que haga lo que haga en salamanca siempre habr quien les vote
162599 los ciudadanos y ciudadanas merecen que su clase pol tica sea capaz de unirse aunque sea circunstancialmente s lo por esta vez para lograr el correcto funcionamiento de un servicio p blico que garantice la necesaria comunicaci n de salamanca con la capital pues son muchos los ciudadanos salmantinos que han sido obligados a emigrar por la falta de oportunidad queremos un servicio p blico asequible accesible seguro y eficaz la clase pol tica salmantina debe seguir el ejemplo de las de otras latitudes que en el pasado reciente supieron aparcar sus diferencias es el caso de la crisis de los cercan as en barcelona del pasado oto o en la que pudimos ver incluso a militantes y cargos p blicos de esquerra manifest ndose junto al partido popular algo que fue fundamental para que la actualidad nacional hiciera un hueco a un problema local de transporte
162600 que le falt tiempo para encaminar a la ciudad de salamanca hacia una confrontaci n directa con el gobierno central cuando ste decidi devolver algunos legajos expoliados a la generalitat
162601 en esta ocasi n no hay que ondear banderas al viento ni azuzar el enfrentamiento entre comunidades pero eso no debe ser bice sino m s bien todo lo contrario para que juntos todas las fuerzas pol ticas sociales sindicales y vecinales de salamanca seamos capaces de organizarnos y luchar por un ferrocarril p blico y de calidad de todos y para todos que est a la altura del siglo xxi
162602 las tres administraciones tienen mucho que decir y mucho que aportar para dignificar el ferrocarril en salamanca eso debe tenerlo claro todo el mundo y la exigencia conjunta de responsabilidades debe ser un punto de partida
162603 el apeadero de la alamedilla y su entorno lejos de ser una llegada atractiva y una tarjeta de presentaci n para los turistas da bastante verg enza ajena por el estado de deterioro abandono y suciedad en que se encuentra
162604 proponemos su mejora revitalizaci n e impulso y tanto adif como el ayuntamiento tienen mucho dinero que poner sobre la mesa
162605 cesi n de un espacio municipal para que renfe vuelva a contar en salamanca con una oficina de atenci n al cliente no es cierto y los usuarios lo saben que las nuevas tecnolog as hayan garantizado comodidad atenci n y resoluci n de problemas m s bien al contario la supresi n de puestos de trabajo y de la vieja oficina de la plazuela de la libertad han generado inconvenientes a clientes y usuarios que para comprar billetes consultar horarios y ofertas o poner reclamaciones viven una aut ntica odisea en un espacio vialia que puede ser calificado de cualquier cosa menos de un espacio al servicio del viajero
162606 el principal foco de atenci n de los equipos de msf ha sido intentar salvar la vida de los ni os con malnutrici n severa el grupo que corre un mayor riesgo
162607 apadrinar un ni o extreme o por 1 000 euros al mes
162608 esta campa a no es m s que la actuaci n de una persona que desconoce extremadura una regi n que tiene muchas cosas que mostrar a espa a y al resto del mundo
162609 son las cosas que soportamos todav a fruto de la ignorancia y de los enormes t picos que nos acompa an hist ricamente y que s lo unos cuantos siguen manteniendo por desconocimiento de de la regi n de su realidad y su gente
162610 nos tendr amos que unir a la campa a que nos propone este cartel para limpiar nuestra imagen de insolidarios
162611 siempre se ha dicho que el peor enemigo de los catalanes somos los mismos catalanes hay catalanes que fomentan su propio auto odio el no querer aceptarse como lo que son catalanes y catalanas

162629 the most significant challenge to the recovery process in sri lanka is ongoing civil conflict escalating violence over the past few years has set back reconstruction efforts in the north and east of the country though it continues largely apace in the south
162630 security concerns have posed operational hurdles across a range of sectors making it difficult or impossible for international aid partners to move or deliver assistance and supplies restrictions on transportation of certain construction materials such as cement and steel as well as difficulties in accessing certain areas have hampered recovery
162631 security has remained a problem sometimes even after completion of projects and people have returned to their normal jobs
162632 there is a big checkpoint at manampitiya about 80 km northeast of batticaloa city where everything is thoroughly checked even fish lorries
162633 some of the fishermen complain that when the checking takes too long or when their loads are unloaded and kept in the open too long the fish are spoiled and not sellable by the time they reach their destinations

162647 the developers have realigned their prices but there is not much more that they can do and survive they are at rock bottom prices
162648 an unexpected activity that brought sudden risk to the organization and took one or more security personnel to address
162649 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported
162650 security professionals need to remain cognizant of the regulations that their organizations must comply with and ensure they are taking steps to properly report the security incidents that are required by law whatever they may be
162651 that venture investing is not the best use of a corporations capital and that it is inevitable that it will produce sub par returns at best and significant losses at worst
162652 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
162653 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
162654 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
162655 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
162656 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
162657 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
162658 so far the only reason customers have noticed is because it became news

162661 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
162662 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
162663 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
162664 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
162665 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
162666 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
162667 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
162668 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
162669 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
162670 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
162671 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
162672 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
162673 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
162674 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
162675 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
162676 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
162677 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
162678 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
162679 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
162680 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
162681 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
162682 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china

162688 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
162689 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
162690 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
162691 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
162692 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
162693 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
162694 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
162695 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
162696 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting
162697 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
162698 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
162699 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
162700 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
162701 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
162702 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year
162703 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time

162725 i have been hearing these claims for the past ten years i will no longer pay any attention to them and i will not react
162726 it is amazing that there are still people in this world who trust the word of a war crimes indictee over that of the united states and the people who brought peace to the balkans
162727 i really doubt an experienced diplomat such as holbrooke would ever make a deal with a man indicted for war crimes

162731 as far as we are concerned we dont see any problem with giving karadzics lawyers those documents but we first have to establish that he had them on him on the day he was arrested

162740 i think youre saving too much money for your future and not using some of your income to meet your current goals
162741 i consider myself to be splurging if i dont save at least 20 of my gross income 10 is nothing youll be eating dog food when you are 80 years old if that is all you are putting away
162742 im all in favor of saving and am pretty aggressive myself but there comes a point at which you are squandering your healthy youthful years when you actually can enjoy more of what life offers advisers would be more credible if they were willing to recognize both sides of this issue
162743 are you kidding with the dollar shrinking year by year and the threat of social security problems drive a bigger car or live larger is what you suggest that is the kind of advice that put american in the position it is in today better to be over prepared than under what a joke

162753 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
162754 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves this practice seems to be fraught with conflicts of interest
162755 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
162756 many doctors learn about new drugs from drug company salespersons who may not be objective
162757 studies confirm that when unbiased health professionals armed with educational materials provide guidance to doctors they are more likely to purchase the best drug for the patient instead of the best deal for the pharmaceutical company
162758 this legislation a cost effective common sense and practical solution to a serious problem it is exactly the kind of support the federal government should be providing the states
162759 im proud to note that pennsylvania has one of the best and most innovative academic detailing programs in the country with documented and measurable cost savings
162760 for far too long most of the information physicians receive to make prescribing decisions has come from the drug companies marketing reps not independent experts this important legislation will go a long way toward giving doctors another less biased perspective
162761 providing doctors with objective information about prescription drugs allows them to prescribe the most effective treatment to their patients
162762 through this legislation medical professionals will have the option of hearing independent and scientific opinions on a wider range of drugs devices and medical interventions which also has a proven record of lowering health care costs
162763 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all
162764 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
162765 as long time proponents of comparative effectiveness research the blue cross and blue shield association supports this legislation and its goal of making sure doctors have access to objective information about the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs
162766 providing doctors with information based on independent clinical research will help patients get the best treatment and improve safety and affordability of healthcare for everyone
162767 we are very pleased with the performance of the aria tlx 4 multiplexing system with turboflow technology

162769 we are thrilled with the success ameritox has realized through our comprehensive solution
162770 the benefits derived from the aria tlx 4 multiplexing system powered by turboflow technology combined with the sensitivity and confidence of the tsq quantum access set us apart in the marketplace

162784 in view of the growing incidence not only in germany but around the world shopping addiction must be taken seriously by health professionals and by the health insurance industry
162785 women go out and buy pretty things for themselves or for others such as clothes shoes jewelry food and things for the home
162786 men go out and buy their own version of pretty things which tend to be things for the car or sporting equipment power tools and household gadgets most of which are packed away in a storage closet or in the garden shed and never used
162787 for several days they will be good and not go out shopping
162788 then one day they cant resist any longer and go out and buy things in a shopping binge
162789 shopping addicts rarely enjoy the things they buy because they feel so guilty afterwards
162790 they cant bear to look at the things they have bought on impulse often they have bought several of the same thing say the same shoes but in several different colors they feel so guilty afterwards that they hoard the things away in their boxes and try to forget about them
162791 people who go out and buy everything in sight and then hide it all away in a closet are not collectors
162792 they are hoarders who are trying to cover up for their shopping addiction collectors place things on exhibit hoarders hide things away for some future eventuality which for shopping addicts never comes their hoard is never brought out of hiding
162793 we discovered that shopping addicts get a real kick out of the interaction they have with store personnel their fragile egos are given a tremendous boost by sales people who fawn over them and smile and treat them like royalty
162794 their conscious minds know of course that these people only want to make a commission on a sale but their subconscious minds enjoy being treated as a special somebody
162795 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

162843 women dont participate in the economic social and political arena because they havent had a chance to study when they are growing up many girls have to stay home to help take care of their families so they dont go to school this means that women have limited knowledge compared to men
162844 because of this deeply ingrained cultural belief many women come to accept a lower status or feel powerless to rise above their current station in life this makes it difficult for most women to even imagine a more active role in politics in border areas where armed conflict has been a fact of life for generations women are further discouraged from pursuing political careers by the perception that only those with proven military track records are qualified to lead

162916 in the latest review of the credit policy the rbi has increased the repo rate by 50 basis points and crr by 25 basis points while leaving the reverse repo rate unchanged bringing the current repo rate and crr to 9 the rbi has clearly stated its purpose as trying to curb inflation and aims to bring down the rate of inflation to below 10 by march 2009 as a result of the new policy banks are expected to hike their plr by a approximately 50 basis points in the near future and this will be passed on to the consumer there is an expectation of further increase in the fourth quarter in order to curtail inflation from the demand side as the supply side is expected to remain inelastic in the near term
162917 this increase in repo rate will result in increasing interest rates and the increase of crr by 25 basis points is expected to mop out approximately inr 1700 cores of liquidity from the system the new credit policy will tighten the lending norms as specified by the rbi and thus is likely to lead to a more cautious approach from financial institutions in terms of lending to corporations as well as individuals increasing lending cost is also likely to force developers to review their future plans and may even cause some of them to delay their current projects if they sense a softening demand
162918 there will certainly be an impact banks will not be able to finance many future real estate projects because of shortage of funds it will increase the cost of capital for new as well as ongoing projects home loan rates will rise further and banks will in any case reduce their exposure to the real estate market which is already witnessing a slowdown this will compound the problem transactions will slow down and there will be an overall negative impact on the market
162919 in all the reserve bank has increased the crr by 150 basis points this year while the repo has gone up 125 basis points including the latest announcements this harsh measure is expected to raise the plr by at least 0 50 per cent

162936 from foreigners point of view it might seem like a slowdown in reform but fukuda sees it as steady reform
162937 i see this as a cabinet reshuffle to show that fukuda wants to call a general election under his leadership

162970 we think the diaries are just fantastically pertinent to all sorts of aspects of contemporary life
162971 whats particularly poignant about the diaries and the period were putting them up is that were running into the anniversary next year of the start of the second world war and for orwell this was an incredibly important moment so we wanted to generate enthusiasm and interest around that
162972 my husbands godmother was orwells first wifes sister and when i had richard blair orwells adopted son over for supper he said he remembers playing in the same gardens ben had
162973 ben also wrote a couple of introductions to orwell books when they were republished in various forms so there was a sort of direct bloodline
162974 i discovered orwell when i was about twenty and it was like a great big wonderful flood of light that i understood in which you could both be fantastically critical of your country but ultimately actually you could be patriotic you could love it
162975 you could be on the left but actually be critical of the left that was just like a key to a door somebody needed to open for me
162976 there are lots of touching bits hes quite domestic hes quite sweet hes an endearing tall big footed slightly clumsy englishman
162977 always prepared to use his eyes and think for himself and reassess everything that everybody took for granted
162978 when i was a little girl i used to go out with a sense of what would you do if you were in a concentration camp or if something really awful happened and i always thought that id be a coward
162979 and you know that orwell wouldnt have been a coward theres something stunningly decent and honest and brave about him
162980 he is a great writer whose work survives translation into every language in the world and survives into every nations experience
162981 all through the cold war russians and east germans read it and found comfort in it burmese find comfort in it chinese find inspiration in orwell its an incredible thing he could not be more british he defines what it is to be british and yet hes universal
162982 man im sure a lot less hardcore than those guys im going to end up with a cooking show or something lame like that

162990 dont scream and shout because i had a reason for calling youre in bed right get up and can you get up
162991 its gorgeous ive never seen anything like it what could make the moon light up like that
162992 listen ive never seen it like this but theres an old legend
162993 once every hundred years the los angeles smog rolls away for a single night leaving the air as clear as interstellar space that way the gods can see if los angeles is still there if it is they roll the smog back so they wont have to look at it
162994 i used to know all that stuff well listen im glad you woke me up to see it but ive got to get to work tomorrow
162995 its wonderful i even tried to use my telescope but i couldnt see a thing it was too bright it lights up the whole city the hills are all silver
162996 listen leslie love i started thinking about how i woke you up and how you probably couldnt get back to sleep what with all this light so lets go out for a midnight snack
162997 you think you can compete with a hot fudge sundae do you
162998 its past midnight nobodys going to pick you up because id thrash the blackguard right so why not be comfortable
162999 were celebrating get us two hot fudge sundaes will you
163000 you remember i told myself if i got any overpowering urges id have a cigarette i did that because i couldnt stand the thought of never smoking again
163001 nope weve got things to do how about some irish coffee
163002 see that man in the turtleneck there at the end of the piano bar
163003 he came in two hours ago and handed the bartender a hundred dollar bill
163004 i know i know but we cant run away from it can we
163005 but when i tried to check it out it didnt work
163006 i went out on the balcony and turned the telescope on jupiter mars is below the horizon these nights if the suns gone nova all the planets ought to be lit up like the moon right
163007 but jupiter wasnt any brighter than usual so then i didnt know what to think
163008 all lit up like a fucking neon sign well that tears it
163009 lets get out of here let em think theres going to be a dawn
163010 i cant you know i cant stop crying once i get started
163011 this wasnt what i had in mind i thought wed do things weve been putting off things we like its our last chance is this the way you want to die crying on a street corner
163012 you show me a way out and ill take it
163013 hawaii stan we could get to the airport in twenty minutes wed get two hours extra going west two hours more before sunrise
163014 no wed die sooner listen love we saw the moon go bright about midnight that means california was at the back of the earth when the sun went nova
163015 look at it this way first the sun explodes that heats the air and the oceans all in a flash all across the day side the steam and superheated air expand fast a flaming shock wave comes roaring over into the night side its closing on us right now like a noose but itll reach hawaii first hawaii is two hours closer to the sunset line
163016 then we wont see the dawn we wont live even that long
163017 sorry ive been thinking about it too much wondering what it will be like
163018 theres a shock wave from the sun too there should be an aurora like nothing anybodys ever seen before
163019 it seems so strange standing on a street corner talking like this stan are we dreaming it
163020 no most of the human race must be dead already
163021 damn it you figured that out long ago all by yourself why bring it up now
163022 i was dropping off to sleep when you whispered in my ear
163023 we could go back to your place now or my place to sleep
163024 i suppose but we couldnt sleep could we no dont say it we take sleeping pills and five hours from now we wake up screaming id rather stay awake at least well know whats happening
163025 it neverrains like this in california it comes down straight and heavy when it comes at all takes days to build up
163026 now when the rain lets up well run these out ready
163027 we picked a good break you know what this weather reminds me of kansas
163028 but how if the shock wave were here already dead or at least deaf hail
163029 all right what would you like to do most right now
163030 right weve hopped our last bar weve seen our last play and our last clean movie whats left
163031 this is great there must be half a dozen jewelry stores in walking distance
163032 no no no you dont have the proper attitude one must window shop on foot its in the rules
163033 no thats a good thought imagine them at dawn flaming with nova light while the windows shatter to let raw daylight in want one the necklace
163034 oh may i hey hey i was kidding put that down you idiot there must be alarms in the glass
163035 look nobodysgoing to be wearing any of that stuff between now and morning why shouldnt we get some good out of it
163036 i dont want to spend my last hour in a cell
163037 i spent the whole day fixing a mistake in a program now we1l never run it
163038 what would you have done with the time a baseball game
163039 its a topless place i used to go there all the time i hear theyve gone full nude now
163040 ive never been to one of those how late are they open
163041 isnt there someone you would have murdered if youd had the time
163042 my child why would any writer want to murder his agent
163043 weve got the rumaki and the bottles and the nuts what more do we need
163044 you could be steamed dead on the way down we might not have more than a few minutes left and you want food for a week why
163045 we may need food for a week and a place to hide
163046 i cant promise anything i wanted to wait but you forced it ive been wondering if the sun really has exploded
163047 thats cruel i was just getting used to the idea
163048 there should have been an aurora borealis to light up the night sky from pole to pole a shock wave of particles exploding out of the sun traveling at an inch short of the speed of light would rip into the atmosphere like why wed have seen blue fire over every building
163049 a nova would rip away the sky over half the planet the shock wave would move around the night side with a sound to break all the glass in the world all at once and crack concrete and marble and leslie love it just hasnt happened so i started wondering
163050 could turn the moon and planets into so many torches then fade out as if nothing had happened
163051 we should set up our picnic grounds here behind the counter sooner or later the wind is going to break those doors and shower glass all over everything
163052 look at you youre all nervous now afraid of dying hasnt it been a lovely night
163053 unique i wish id known in time to take you to dinner
163054 farmers market double roasted peanuts who would you have murdered if youd had the time
163055 do you really think the sun might go back to normal
163056 it better be back to normal otherwise were dead anyway i wish we could see jupiter
163057 dammit answer me do you think it was a flare
163058 more than youd guess they can see them coming months ahead sol is a gee naught yellow dwarf they dont go nova at all they have to wander off the main sequence first and that takes millions of years
163059 i dont want to believe it i dont dare stan nothing like this has ever happened before how can you know
163060 do you remember the first moon landing aldrin and armstrong
163061 of course we watched it at earls lunar landing party
163062 they landed on the biggest flattest place they could find on the moon
163063 sometime in the past oh say the past hundred thousand years theres no way of marking it closer than that the sun flared up it didnt stay hot enough long enough to leave any marks on the earth but the moon doesnt have an atmosphere to protect it all the rocks melted on one side
163064 im not so sure suppose it happened over the pacific it wouldnt do that much damage or over the american continents it would have sterilized some plants and animals and burned down a lot of forests and whod know the sun is a four percent variable star maybe it gets a touch more variable than that every so often
163065 i believe youve put your finger on the crux of the matter skol
163066 something like trying to get up into the hills stan therere going to be floods
163067 you bet your ass there are but they wont rise this high
163068 as for heading for the hills what hills we wont get far tonight not with the streetsflooded already suppose we could get up into the santa monica mountains then what mudslides thats what that area wont stand up to whats coming the flare must have boiled away enough water to make another ocean its going to rain for forty days and forty nights love this is the safest place we could have reached tonight
163069 if the floods marroon us here we can last it out

163132 an apologia for hitler when i was a kid i heard every sunday how jesus would forgive hitler if he really really repented but i say fuck that some things cant be forgiven or redeemed
163133 you are telling me that if i wrote a story where hitler escapes to brazil prevents a massacre of some native americans and then raises a bunch of jews from the dead that this would be about parallel
163134 then a funny thing happened the sequel to speaker never appeared speaker ended on a cliffhanger with ender waiting for a fleet to arrive and shag his sorry ass and everyone assumed card would write the third book and go for the hugo nebula trifecta in 1987 instead he started a whole different series and didnt get around to writing the ender sequel until 1992 what the hell was up with that
163135 respected professional editor has much to answer for in unleashing orson scott card upon science fiction
163136 i was actually shocked i could not understand how the author of these stories which were in no way professional on
163137 this time i picked one which had been published i hoped that this would insure a higher quality
163138 why was this story published what made another respected professional editor buy it and place it in a volume next to highly acclaimed authors could it have been that campbell award that the winner of the campbell award was in fact the worst possible choice of all the nominees that cards reputation is a flimsy house of cards waiting for the first critical examination to collapse
163139 still writing an essay is not the same as getting it published and i didnt think anyone would be willing to publish elaines little rant for one thing in 1986 card was more than just a popular writer he was also a deft political animal he was in fact a high mucky muck in sfwa and word was that bad things happened to people who got on his bad side not necessarily italian mob style bad things but bad things like not having a chance at awards yourself and publishers shunning you

163447 its like a pimple on his behind for cuban but 6 plus million is a big number for me i dont feel like ive won the lottery because ive already earned that money but its good to know im going to get it
163448 its not the way i wanted this to go i wanted to be the red auerbach of the dallas mavericks after coaching but thats not what cuban wanted im having fun again and thats the way it should be its all working out great with the warriors and ill probably end up doing something in a franchise patriarch role like i thought i was going to do in dallas
163449 i got exactly what i wanted out of the deal the true facts of the situation
163450 i feel a lot better knowing that under oath nelson said that during dallas nba finals games in 2006 that he was meeting with golden states gm and helping the warriors work on their draft plans

163452 im really glad that i have a chance to test my team against serious opponents ahead of the its start
163453 we came here to prepare the best possible way for the season opening match with portsmouth its my dominating idea for the moment
163454 we played three good games in china but those were not strong games here we will face much more strong opponents
163455 we will start against against the hosts lokomotiv and then will face either milan or sevilla its very useful experience now im already sure about 85 percents of my first line up i hope after this tournament ill be completely sure about it
163456 the feedback i received from the teams that competed last year was that the organisation was excellent and the teams participating were of a very high standard
163457 its so scary and we sat there and we talked about all the bad things that could happen
163458 i remember coming up to her after the meet and saying congratulations youre an all american
163459 she didnt want to hear it she was ticked off to the point where she didnt want to talk about it
163460 and jenns standing on the track looking like whats next
163461 i had teachers and faculty telling me i made a mistake and telling me that i shouldnt be doing this that rick doesnt know what hes talking about
163462 afterwards i was so mad because i didnt jump a world record
163463 there is no other greater achievement to be the best person in your sport on any given day
163464 what i said is slavery is with the young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old young boys and bring them to the big clubs this is my expression this is modern slavery
163465 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it ronaldo is not a slave
163466 this principle has been made by the fifa congress in the year 1988
163467 it has worked for 20 years and nobody has ever put into question that the player under 23 shall be released

163469 er steckte sein gep ck in die ablage ber den sitzen er sagte zu niemandem ein wort er wirkte total normal er hatte eine sonnenbrille auf er setzte sich und dann eine halbe stunde sp ter h rten wir diesen schrei der einem das blut in den adern gefrieren lie und drehten uns um
163470 da stand dieser typ stach auf den anderen ein immer wieder immer wieder wie ich wei nicht es muss 40 50 mal gewesen sein in den hals und in die brust w hrend er ihn angriff war er ruhig wie es war als w re er gerade am strand er war total ruhig er sagte nichts da war keine wut oder oder irgendwas er war einfach wie ein roboter der diesen typen niedersticht
163471 er befahl jedem den bus zu verlassen wir verlie en den bus jeder verlie den bus aber einige von uns ich und ein trucker der vorbeikam und einer der greyhound fahrer stiegen wieder ein um zu sehen was passierte und dann sahen wir er hatte den typen auf dem boden er schnitt ihm den kopf ab und war nun ja dabei ihn auszuweiden
163472 der trucker der hatte ein brecheisen und wir rannten wir besorgten uns einen hammer und anderes zeug da versuchten ich und der andere busfahrer die t r zu bewachen stemmten uns mit unseren k rpern gegen die t r und wissen sie warteten darauf dass er rauskommt und so er kehrte zur ck und brachte den kopf nach vorne und zeigte ihn uns und dann lie er ihn vor uns auf den boden fallen sehr ruhig alles sehr ruhig er trug eine sonnenbrille und es wirkte wissen sie als w re es keine gro e sache f r ihn
163473 jedes mal wenn ich die augen schlie e sehe ich diesen mann am fenster vor mir der den kopf eines mannes in der hand h lt mit dem ich gerade eine zigarette geraucht habe
163474 ruhe in frieden tim mclean du bist geliebt und wirst innig vermisst werden
163475 ich wusste dass er von einer ausstellung zur ckkehren sollte mein bruder sollte ihn am busbahnhof abholen aber er kam nie an

163480 it wasnt as huge a fight as you are making it all sound
163481 just like any other conversation centered on creative decisions me and abbas too got into this entire debate around the color of clothing for some strange reasons he wasnt really enthused about using blue color in the clothes worn by imraan and others perhaps he felt that it was too unconventional
163482 we both stuck to our ground and it seemed like we had come across a deadlock
163483 well we kept on chatting around this and none of us were willing to buzz he was stuck and so was i guess ultimately i was more stuck than him and abbas finally relented

163486 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
163487 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
163488 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
163489 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
163490 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
163491 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
163492 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
163493 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
163494 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
163495 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
163496 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
163497 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
163498 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
163499 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
163500 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
163501 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
163502 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
163503 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
163504 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

163509 ya has llegado es la hora un momentito estamos terminando de comer
163510 ya estoy podemos empezar cuando quieras que si no me engordan las hamburguesas pues creo que no porque la verdad es que ltimamente me alimento a base de perritos calientes de pizzas y de hamburguesas es que no tengo tiempo para nada y yo creo que si no engordo es porque al cuerpo se le acostumbra y el m o est acostumbrado a que yo coma lo que quiera por eso no engordo porque ejercicio tampoco hago trabajando 15 horas diarias no tiene una tiempo ni de gimnasios ni de nada antes s antes me gustaba mucho hacer kick boxing alg n d a me apuntar de nuevo cuando mi vida sea m s relajada ahora imposible
163511 s es que antes nos llev bamos fatal pero eso era antes ahora ya est todo solucionado bromea pilar el problema lo tuvimos por una plaza de aparcamiento nos ve amos obligadas a compartirla de ah las peleas hasta que encontramos la soluci n ella podr a aparcar su coche en los d as pares y yo en los impares as arreglamos todo y el lamet n recuerde el lector o visione en youtube un leng etazo que conde le estamp a pilar en riguroso directo fue porque darek me hab a dado dos besos por lo que ella se mor a de envidia
163512 creo que no existe esa universidad pilar se echa a re r yo desde luego el nico sitio en el que he estudiado ha sido en la universidad de alcal de henares la carrera de econ micas no no la he terminado la llevo a la mitad
163513 porque saber de n meros sirve mucho en esta vida
163514 terminar la carrera ahora imposible vivo sin tiempo para m mucho menos para ponerme a estudiar
163515 ya he recibido muchas propuestas y no he aceptado ninguna comenta pilar mientras susana su representante asiente con la cabeza el secreto es que yo disfruto haciendo mi trabajo me lo paso bomba con los reportajes que luego salen en la tele y estoy muy a gusto si alg n d a no me lo pasara bien hip tesis que no se va a dar lo dejar a las cosas hay que dejarlas cuando dejan de ilusionarte
163516 yo sirvo para todo por eso me gusta este trabajo porque cada d a es un reto nuevo yo no podr a estar ocho horas al d a delante del ordenador me morir a del aburrimiento no sirvo para eso eso s quiero que quede claro que nunca he dicho que sea periodista no me considero periodista siempre he explicado lo que hago en s lo que hicisteis una actriz que interpreta el papel de reportera al fin y al cabo se trata de un programa de humor que quede claro que yo no le quito el trabajo a ning n periodista y s lo reconozco uno de mis sue os ser a ser una gran actriz y puestos a so ar me encantar a trabajar con tarantino kill bill es de mis pel culas favoritas
163517 si alguien afirma que se acaba la pasi n en una pareja es porque no ha encontrado a la persona adecuada si la encuentras el amor no se puede acabar para m cada d a supone una fiesta estar con l llego a casa con la ilusi n de verle y estoy convencida de algo si se acaba el amor a los tres a os significa que no era amor verdadero
163518 supongo que me ocurre como a todas las mujeres unos d as te miras en el espejo y no te gustas nada y otros por el contrario te ves muy guapa pero lo verdaderamente importante es aceptarte tal cual eres y si transmites e irradias felicidad te conviertes autom ticamente en una persona m s atractiva

163522 if you decide to send him back to chittenden county on a holiday visit that would be your agencys decision i think it would be a very foolish decision
163523 if you are foolish enough to send him on a pre placement visit it is on your own head ok i understand what youre saying that would be your responsibility the court would have no part of it
163524 this impacts not only obviously the public safety but the vibrancy of our community the business community the marketplace does very well its the hallmark of burlington and if we have people clearly who are mentally ill and a danger to themselves we need to take extraordinary steps if necessary to make sure that he is not walking on the streets
163525 my fear is one of these people could be a child molester
163526 the folks that were talking about just need some help with daily living
163527 its not people at risk these people are all functional they just cannot live without supervision
163528 it hurts because its just not fair it isnt fair to us because were people we may have an illness but were people
163529 a lot of my friends wont have anywhere to go theyll be hanging out on the streets or wherever
163530 you lose something when you shift the focus from money instead of people and thats a real shame
163531 where are we going to go were tossed into the street where are we going to go now

163535 the physician noted that it was difficult to control aggressive situations between two patients on a unit that had 30 plus male patients and only two male technicians to control this situation
163536 the coroners report doesnt say that police compressed mr abrahams to death
163537 who am i to say mr abrahams was not acting aggressively toward the officers
163538 they intentionally dog piled him it was this intentional conduct that resulted in his death
163539 all those facts support our position that the officers use of force was unwarranted
163540 im hopeful that city of woodland will take full responsibility for the officers conduct and resolve this case without causing the abrahams family to go through the pain of protracted litigation

163557 the doctors concluded that mr popal did not know the nature or consequences of his behavior
163558 clearly his conduct has not been questioned the conduct was outrageous and was clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of the victims
163559 knowing that the likelihood is that he will spend the rest of his life in a high security state mental facility is something we all think about
163560 i believe that this is the appropriate outcome to a horrific case

163568 shepard writes the richest prose in all of dark fantasy the longish short story and the novella are his fortes and it isnt too extreme to say he ranks with hawthorne in depth of concentration perception and moral resonance quite often shepard seems to be writing fantasy only because he conceives of magic supernatural or existential arising out of extreme violence and terror always however he is writing better than nearly anyone else in anglophone america today
163569 blochs pulp magazine stories satisfyingly seasoned with horror mystery and humor sometimes unnerving often shamelessly purple of prose are entertainment pure and simple

163593 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy

163595 the new rates which have already become effective from july 16 are aimed at attracting more climbers to all mountains including mount everest even during the off season
163596 this is a move to attract climbers to those areas so the poor people there can benefit from tourism
163597 my hope is more and more people will come to climb beautiful mountains
163598 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
163599 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead

163658 i think were all just sick of the girls getting all this bad publicity just because theyre famous
163659 i think this is a brilliant idea and hopefully it will get jess to laugh or at least smile then it will all be worth it
163660 may it turn out to be a wonderful thing fingers crossed

163664 both sides face risks and opportunities obamas pioneering status is inspiring to some voters and discomfiting to others and the way in which race is discussed may push voters toward or away from him mccain could benefit from discomfort with race or he could like hillary rodham clinton his predecessor in battling obama be distracted and ultimately diminished by constant charges of racism accurate or not
163665 but the aftermath of this campaign flashpoint indicated points were scored for the republican side obamas campaign quickly put out a statement thursday retracting the candidates suggestion that mccain had improperly used race and while on a conference call with reporters campaign manager

163672 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
163673 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
163674 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
163675 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
163676 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
163677 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
163678 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot

163705 i knew he was coming back from the exhibition my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up and then my younger brother and my other brother went to go to his parents place to see if they know anything and they saw a bunch of news people there and then they asked at his parents and thats how we found out
163706 the kids will miss you so much and so will william and i you were a great person always happy and loved and had an amazing personality
163707 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
163708 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
163709 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
163710 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
163711 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
163712 just to say how special it is in the whole universe we might be among the few beings that have the chance of seeing something like that
163713 the fact that we have a moon and that the moon passes in front of our sun and that the apparent size of our moon is approximately equal to the apparent size of the sun all these factors combine to create the solar eclipse phenomenon
163714 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

163724 was to create a secure period of time so the government of iraq would have political room to take actions that would bring political reconciliation to iraq
163725 since the surge began 1 100 of our troops have died
163726 they told us it would take 60 to 90 days to do it all its a year and a half and it still hasnt happened
163727 whether you are talking about provincial elections whether you are talking about amending the constitution whether you are talking about de baathification the rest of it it still hasnt happened and so the purpose of the surge has not been fulfilled
163728 but to what end when will we know our troops can leave how much longer will they be needed
163729 the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state
163730 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
163731 we have to see what kind of legislation is introduced
163732 i want to take a look at it i havent made a decision i havent even thought about it
163733 were being told the soviets are striving to achieve a comparatively low standard of living with ours but actually they have reached a basic stability in meeting their needs and are now planning to double their production
163734 alice came in as an independent she came in through the progressive movement the former chicago mayor harold washington coalition and she remained loyal to that progressive base throughout her political career
163735 she was a citizen of the world and she brought back a vast knowledge because of her travels
163736 she would always come back with progressive ideas to benefit the people of illinois global warming she was talking about it before the rest of us back when both of us were elected as democratic ward committeemen in 1989
163737 but the soviets do not link these issues with ruining the living standards of human beings
163738 the soviets are carrying out a policy to resolve inequalities between nationalities inequalities that they say were inherited from capitalist and czarist rule
163739 they have a comprehensive affirmative action program which they have stuck to religiously if i can use that word since 1917
163740 alice was a progressive and the type of person who felt like you had to talk to everybody around the world regardless of their political persuasion and i agree with her for the most part
163741 just because someone is from a different culture or a different political persuasion to say we wont talk with him is ridiculous
163742 power concedes nothing without a demand never has never will
163743 i dont remember her having any kind of imprint on any particularly legislation i dont have much memory of her having any signature bills or anything like that
163744 some people talked about that i think she would have made a great mayor but i dont think that was serious conversation back then
163745 i remember her as a reasoned voice and well thought of and well spoken
163746 when i served in the senate with her republicans were in control so those kinds of agendas were not part of our dialogue
163747 it hyde park is an extremely liberal part of chicago from my perspective i look at the perspective i have of sen obama in the senate certainly i would consider him to be very liberal so that does speak to the politics of that very area i suppose
163748 i plan to go to canada to learn first hand about the system and to look for ways we can adapt and improve it to meet illinois
163749 health care reform is of major concern of all americans i support the implementation of universal health care legislation based on the canadian system which provides health care services to all citizens
163750 that may have been something she saw in another country she did travel the world
163751 there were things she would see in another country doing better than us or in a different way thats effective why not bring it home to our citizens so she was way ahead of the curve on universal health care and climate change
163752 all of us were outraged by the decision and we felt that we needed to go on record and challenge the u s justice department to pursue whether rodney kings civil rights were violated with as much enthusiasm as they are following what happened with the white truck driver
163753 were concerned about government ethics and reformed election reform and civil liberties in criminal justice
163754 we are opposed to capital punishment we were supportive of the gay rights bill that was up and controversial around that time 1995 in illinois were pro abortion rights we favor progressive taxes
163755 i liked alice palmer a lot i thought she was a good public servant it was very awkward that part of it i wish had played out entirely different
163756 she tapped obama to run and he went out and got petitions and the like and she after losing the primary she flipped changed her mind
163757 i dont think she had a lot of sympathy from democrats having chosen her successor have him go out and work hard to get on the ballot and then all of a sudden she changes her mind and wants her spot back
163758 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

163771 w hrend der vergangenen monate lieferten ausl ndische journalisten dennoch weiterhin wichtige reportagen ber wesentliche probleme in china

163774 die zerst rerische kraft die von den verst en gegen die versprochene medienfreiheit w hrend der olympischen spiele ausgeht wird noch lange nachwirken nachdem die letzten athleten peking verlassen haben
163775 es liegt im interesse des ioc sowie der ausl ndischen staats und regierungschefs die die olympischen spiele in peking besuchen werden sich daf r einzusetzen dass die medienfreiheit in china ein bleibendes verm chtnis der spiele ist und nicht als gebrochenes versprechen in erinnerung bleibt

164010 well your son parked himself on my sofa and refused to budge until i agreed to come this seemed less costly than feeding him for the next eight decades never mind the smell
164011 thank you for the dress robes i love the color
164012 i thought that shade would look good on you you look so lovely rose doesnt she harry
164013 i wont be at all surprised if you attract the attention of a few admirers tonight
164014 in fact i can name several eligible wizards already here eager for an introduction
164015 is that why james was so insistent on my coming so you could play matchmaker
164016 who is that with uncle harry he looks familiar do i know him
164017 its been so long i scarcely recognized him what on earth is he doing here he seems very familiar with uncle harry
164018 fritters away her life with her nose in a ledger tallying up assets and debits even in her dreams and consequently tends not to notice the lives the rest of us lead
164019 how could i forget we were in the same year at hogwarts you used to trounce me in transfiguration on a regular basis
164020 i seem to recall you doing the same to me in potions
164021 its a pleasure to see you again rose its been a long time
164022 so so if that man eater sees me im lost shell sink her claws in me and never let go
164023 james sirius potter since when do you hide from women
164024 bloody hell rose youve done it now shes headed this way
164025 keep my cousin company will you see that she has a good time tonight
164026 do you have any idea what that was all about
164027 i could have sworn i saw jamie standing here just a moment ago
164028 erm he was but he got called away on business urgent business auror er business most urgent
164029 he wont be gone long will he i had such hopes of spending the night with him i even bought these robes just for the occasion
164030 james said he might be gone the rest of the evening you know how it is with these aurors always running off at the slightest pretext if i see him though i promise to let him know you were looking for him
164031 erm sure priscilla ill see that he gets your message
164032 shes er shes whats known as well shes the sort of witch who fancies aurors
164033 ah i think i get the picture a camp follower of sorts
164034 how on earth did she wrangle an invitation here this hardly seems the sort of gathering where her sort would be welcome
164035 i wonder if she knows she has no hope of success with my cousin
164036 so am i to take it that you were an easy conquest
164037 at any rate shes caught the scent of blood now i doubt shell come back this way again
164038 you seem rather sure of yourself how do you know he wont
164039 because your uncle believes that any auror who cant handle a situation like this on his own ought to reconsider his choice of profession
164040 good for uncle harry james is always going on about how women cant keep their hands off him so its high time his boasting came back to bite him in the arse
164041 dont you think youre being a little hard on him
164042 me are you kidding wait til his sister finds out
164043 taking the mickey out of each other is how we show affection in my family well to each other we give outsiders a grace period before breaking them in lull them into a false sense of security then just when theyre starting to relax and feel at ease wham
164044 why then do i get the feeling youve decided to skip over the grace period and jump straight to having a go at me
164045 no no no potter and me no were colleagues thats all
164046 potter said youve always got your nose in a ledger when he introduced us and i might point out i am your uncles assistant i pick up things about people
164047 after youve bought me a drink you can tell me what other sort of things about me youve picked up from working with my uncle
164048 i havent seen you for several years what have you been up to since hogwarts
164049 why do i get the feeling you already know the answer to that question and are testing me to find out what ill say
164050 it is the business of the auror department to keep tabs on people of interest
164051 people of interest merlins pajamas your life must be frightfully dull if i qualify as a person of interest why dont you enlighten me then what have i been up to since hogwarts
164052 perhaps i should tell you what ive been up to instead and you can judge if my life is frightfully dull or not
164053 you underwent auror training after which you were assigned to be my uncles assistant which is where youve been for nearly three years keeping tabs on not very interesting people of interest avoiding the predatory advances of over sexed under dressed tarts and leading a frightfully dull existence
164054 full marks youve got great potential as a seer if you ever decide to give up bookkeeping
164055 i pick up things too your boss is my uncle after all
164056 actually you were wrong on one count i wasnt assigned to your uncle he requested me
164057 i dont mean to imply anything im just curious why uncle harry chose you in particular to be his assistant
164058 maybe i was the most qualified i did earn the highest marks of my entering class
164059 im quite sure youre more than qualified you wouldnt have lasted this long in the position if you werent uncle harry doesnt suffer fools gladly
164060 its simply that he doesnt take such a personal interest on a whim
164061 i hope he doesnt work you too hard i know how obsessive these crusading types can get at times
164062 its not too bad its challenging which im glad of no two days are ever the same
164063 im probably as frightfully dull as you claim there arent many opportunities for a life outside work
164064 especially working with your uncle i love being an auror but you could say im married to my job
164065 dad and uncle georges business is so successful you could say im carrying on quite the torrid romance with my job
164066 well its not as though i ever claimed i wasnt merely that youd have to be to find me even remotely interesting
164067 i was sorry to learn about what happened between you and that manchester bloke last summer what he did was unconscionable
164068 something else you picked up while you were keeping tabs on me
164069 what a pleasure it is to find out that the most painfully intimate details of my life are a favored topic of water cooler gossip
164070 first im sorry it was appallingly gauche of me to blurt out what i did without any warning id been wanting to say something to come clean but it seemed the more we talked the harder it became to find the right moment
164071 you always were rather blunt at school as i recall blunt almost to the point of cruelty
164072 i wasnt trying to be cruel it was a lapse in judgment brought on by my own impatience thats all i truly am sorry for causing you any distress and making you think your private life had been put on display
164073 right that was your apology now you owe me an explanation what do you think you know about what happened between me and philip and why do you even care
164074 i know more than youd like for me to know
164075 and that the final straw was when you came home to find him with someone in your bed
164076 when you said you were keeping tabs i didnt think you really meant it how long have you been spying on me
164077 how else could you have learned something i never even told my own mother
164078 look i admit i stuck my nose where it probably didnt belong
164079 but youve not been under long term surveillance or anything of the sort
164080 how is that supposed to make me feel any better was invading my privacy something you did to take the edge off your frightfully dull existence what did i ever do to you to deserve this anyway malfoy
164081 i bet you and your mates had a right laugh at my expense
164082 after you broke off your engagement and became such a recluse your father got worried he came to your uncle and asked him to try to find out if manchester had done anything to hurt you i had a hunch so i volunteered to look into it on my own time of course thats all it was
164083 would you quit finding bad intentions where there are none i did it off the clock so i wouldnt have to report on what i found i told no one rose not a soul
164084 even now im the only person who knows the truth about what happened
164085 but what about my dad and uncle harry what did you tell them
164086 simply that id found nothing to indicate manchester had done you any harm and that you just needed time to get over a broken heart i didnt think it would do anyone any good if they knew the whole story you least of all you must believe me
164087 he was such a bastard when we were in school and i suspected that hed only grown worse with time
164088 it doesnt matter youre well shot of him and thats what matters
164089 youve violated my privacy in the most painfully invasive way imaginable scorpius you dont get to decide what does and doesnt matter
164090 i dont understand arent you relieved to be free of him
164091 no youre right about that i am relieved i feel more free now than i can remember feeling since i was a little girl but thats not the point
164092 what concerns me now is what you were about to say after you said i was too besotted to see the truth about philip you said i couldnt i didnt then left off i want to hear the rest of that sentence after all youve done after all youve already said you owe me the complete truth
164093 are you joking at school you had your nose so high in the air it was a miracle you didnt get nosebleeds on a daily basis even if i had fancied you you wouldnt have given me the time of day
164094 look whos talking madam you swanned around that castle like you were queen bloody mab
164095 at least i dont go around stalking unsuspecting people prying into their private lives for my own amusement
164096 there was nothing amusing about what i did nothing would have made me happier than to discover my hunch about manchester had been wrong and that hed done nothing to hurt you ive never hated being right more than i did then
164097 rose i cannot take pleasure in anything that hurts you do you understand what im trying to say
164098 lets get you home and into some dry clothes before you catch a chill

164110 friday top 10 reasons to nominate hillary at the convention
164111 thats like the cook asking the captain to peel potatoes
164112 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
164113 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
164114 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
164115 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
164116 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
164117 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
164118 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
164119 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
164120 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
164121 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
164122 john mccain is blaming barack obama for gas prices the same old politics barack obama thinks high gas prices deserve serious answers and a serious plan crack down on oil speculators raise mileage standards and fast track alternative fuels
164123 mccains biggest problem other than the fact he will be 72 and is a republican in this political environment is that voters see obama as better able to fix the economy
164124 energy offers mccain the potential to change the campaign conversation so that the debate over the economy is the debate over energy if hes talking about energy sen mccain has public opinion on his side
164125 two hundred thousand people watched obama in berlin germany but there a lot more votes in berlin ohio and they are people unhappy about 4 gasoline
164126 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
164127 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
164128 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
164129 you just feel part of nature this is so rare
164130 it is quite eerie for any thinking person to watch how everything turns into darkness in broad daylight
164131 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
164132 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
164133 but i didnt turn out to have any special genius so i cant say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me
164134 to provoke war cheney considered dressing navy seals as iranians and shooting at them
164135 im so sorry 4 murdering your people amp enslaving them amp stealing all your resources please forgive me
164136 even though people will stand up screaming the truth it will still end up in war you offend the sensabilities of a brain washed public and theyll be licking shit off your heel in no time theyll die for a lie just like they always have these good ole boys laugh at your war dead i mean seriously they laugh and they think you are a fucking idiot unfortunetly the majority are just that poor uneducated idiots
164137 hersh is getting closer to stating the obvious that 9 11 was a successful false flag psy op
164138 s o p for cheney and the neocon psychopaths these maniacs can kill 3000 of our own people without turning a hair a scheme like this is a picnic in the park for them
164139 arent they just letting us win a few battles to try to lull us into believing we are winning
164140 we only have 10 votes against it in the senate they are going to run right over us its on a fast track
164141 wait a minute if you have ten votes already then youre a third of the way there to stopping it they need a 2 3rds majority to ratify a treaty
164142 do you want our government to have the ability to track where you went how you went how you got there and when you got home
164143 it would be na ve for someone to think this information will not be abused in the future virtually every decade these kinds of files have been used to violate peoples privacy
164144 how about we both go on 60 minutes a few days after the dhs starts patting down montana drivers license holders who are trying to get on the planes and both of us can tell our side of the story
164145 i see the problem we need to get this fixed
164146 more left wing activists leave warming cause call it politics of fear
164147 any kind of weakness of environmental laws or secrecy or changes in the dead of night it s over we re going to make this committee an environment committee not an anti environment committee this is a sea change that is coming to this committee
164148 the boxer climate tax bill was so thoroughly disowned by democratic leadership that proponents of climate taxes will now be forced to start from scratch next year
164149 the green groups now look as politically intimidating as the skinny kid on the beach who gets sand kicked in his face
164150 this issue is starting to feel like the hillary health care plan
164151 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs

164222 what helped was having my family wife and two young children in winnipeg
164223 i didnt actually think about it until i was at a game if they werent there i wouldve thought about it 24 7 that and just knowing that me being frustrated wasnt going to help this team i was just trying to help them guys other bombers receivers out so they could go out and help this team win i guess i couldnt help enough but we did a good job last week and hopefully we can continue on from there
164224 hes one of the people i admire totally in this league
164225 he is in a class all by himself i dont think theres anyone whos close to him that ive played against
164226 he kind of makes other guys rise to the occasion and makes the guys around him play a lot better
164227 we have other guys who can do it so it may not be the call for me to do it
164228 so long as its getting done i dont care who is doing it
164229 im not concerned with my personal stats ive done enough where i dont need to concern myself with that so long as we come away with the victory no matter how it happens be it 1 0 50 1 thats my only concern
164230 everything he will bring to the field in terms of leadership communication talent to me thats everything milt stegall is about

164232 were going to try and get him to the ground as much as possible
164233 knowing they have a tendency of throwing the ball kind of excites the defensive backs a bit
164234 it will let our defensive line get a good pass rush and put some pressure on the quarterback and maybe we can get some overthrown balls
164235 weve waited all year to personally try to get back at dinwiddie for stealing that one last year
164236 i dont know how much he has been tested yet but as a defensive line we have something to prove and were going to get after it

164247 in nederland hebben we een uitstekende positie in het segment voor kleine en middelgrote ondernemingen met de overname van c logic willen we onze bestaande positie in dit marktsegment in belgi versterken
164248 pertumbuhan internet di indonesia begitu masif yang mana secara menyeluruh volume pasarnya mencapai rp25 triliun meliputi printad televisi dan radio hal itu merupakan kesempatan besar selain itu kami juga akan mengembangkan investasi dalam jumlah besar di sini
164249 kami sadar sekarang ini iklan online di indonesia masih sangat kecil masih sekira 0 003 persen namun hal tersebut tidak menjadi masalah karena iklim iklan konvensional dan iklan online berbeda online campaign tidak terlalu dipengaruhi fluktuasi pasar makro pertumbuhannya dinamis oleh sebab itu kami optimistis pasar periklanan online di sini akan berkembang dalam jangka waktu panjang
164250 kami bisa memanfaatkan jumlah pengguna kami tersebut untuk menyokong pemasaran kami di sini kami memiliki global scale best practice hal itu membuat kami lebih optimistis
164251 mungkin dari sekira 40 an juta pengguna internet di sini pada 2009 18 juta di antaranya memiliki yahoo id
164252 kali ini kami membuka silaturahmi dulu kami akan buka kesempatan untuk bekerja sama dengan mitra lokal di sini itu dulu yang akan kami kerjakan
164253 wahrscheinlich raucht der mann selbst oder ist wieder mal auf stimmenfang bei minderbemittelten
164254 es ist sicher unangenehm und irgendwo l stig wenn ein raucher nicht beim ersten schmerzhaften ziepen seiner sucht die kippe anstecken kann aber um eine suchtkrankheit zu befriedigen ist es zumutbar kurz an einen ort zu gehen an dem man niemanden damit st rt
164255 und zwar viel eher zumutbar als die nichtraucher vor die wahl zu stellen das suchtmittel mit einzuatmen oder ganz zuhause zu bleiben wo man leider auch keine rauchfreiheit wirksam einklagen kann

164260 our schedule gives us every opportunity to do everything you can in college football were thrilled people think highly of us but it doesnt mean anything until we start playing were really good at understanding that it feels normal for us to be in that situation but well show who we are by the way we play
164261 then when the kid knocked the shot in by doing what you told him to
164262 i am entering my 16th year of coaching and though i love what i do i sometimes yearn for the purity of what coaching is all about my dream is to live on an island and develop a basketball academy for young kids can you refer me to any practical resources to help me make this move i only ask for advice on the living part ill figure out the basketball aspect later
164263 whenever i go down there its a good time to just kind of detach
164264 but even though youre on vacation basketball never leaves your mind
164265 i think it was one day when i was probably a little bit more relaxed than normal and started thinking what about putting the two things i really enjoy together traveling and being down in that part of the world and coaching basketball
164266 maybe it could grow into training guys down there to keep developing
164267 maybe you could get together with local coaches train them to continue to teach the skills throughout the year then when you come back each summer it just becomes a thing that happens year after year
164268 i still have a tremendous amount of passion for this level and doing it in this environment
164269 so retirement is at an undisclosed age at this point
164270 progress has been made in the last 17 years in decreasing kids risk for hiv and std related infections
164271 however despite the positive changes many students still engage in hiv and std related risk behaviors
164272 for example black students still have the highest prevalence of sexual experience with multiple sex partners and current sexual activity than any of the other subgroups
164273 among hispanic students we didnt see any changes since 1991 in sexual experience multiple partners or current sexual activity
164274 we really need to focus our efforts on these groups in particular but not to the exclusion of everyone else
164275 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
164276 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
164277 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
164278 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
164279 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
164280 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
164281 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
164282 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
164283 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
164284 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
164285 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
164286 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
164287 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths
164288 this large epidemiological study shows for the first time a consistent and robust association between a high blood level of alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular death in thousands of dialysis patients across the united states
164289 if the association between alkaline phosphatase and mortality has a causal link treatment strategies that reduce alkaline phosphatase levels may improve survival in patients with ckd chronic kidney disease and probably in many other patients with chronic diseases and active bone disorders
164290 in dialysis patients increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood indicate a so called high turnover bone disease which can happen due to hormonal imbalance in ckd
164291 alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcification in experimental studies our study shows the clinical manifestation of this association in real world patients
164292 thirty three percent of acute aortic dissection patients die within the first 24 hours if they remain untreated because the disease is not diagnosed
164293 we did our study primarily to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying acute aortic dissection
164294 the study was also aimed at the future development of a clinical test for monitoring patients with a high risk of acute aortic dissection most acute aortic dissection patients do not have a known connective tissue disorder the identification of the four genes could be a starting point to develop a diagnostic tool
164295 any genomic advance that may be able to identify those patients with a heightened risk for acute aortic dissection represents a significant positive step forward
164296 should those patients predisposed to aortic dissection be reliably identified this would permit heightened attention to lifestyle modification blood pressure control and the preemptive administration of certain medications such as beta blockers
164297 additionally in those patients identified as high risk this would undoubtedly involve focused efforts at aortic imaging
164298 its an animal study and its a relatively small sample
164299 its very interesting but putting genetic type research like this into context is quite difficult at the early stage it can offer up great potential but when you then go to humans and when you then go to trained humans the potential may not be there
164300 the hope of some scientists is that they might be able to harness stem cells and program them to generate pluripotent stem cell lines capable of differentiating into many different types of cells which have the genes of patients
164301 this would open up the possibility of producing a large supply of immune matched cells to that patient that could be used in transplantation methodologies
164302 the other hope and one thats much closer upon us is if you could produce the cell types that become sick in that person you might be able to use them in the laboratory to come to understand basic aspects of the disease and take the study of disease out of patients where its very difficult and put it into the petri dish
164303 we dont at all fully understand als and it is our lack of understanding of that disease process which we believe is preventing us from developing more effective treatments
164304 because the disease process is happening in the spinal cord in the central nervous system of patients we dont at all have access to living examples of the neurons that are undergoing the disease process no way could we go to als patients and take samples of their motor neurons
164305 there are still several important caveats for these cells that weve made that are important to be aware of
164306 but for the moment were going to have to press forward with scnt research just in case that doesnt work out
164307 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
164308 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
164309 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
164310 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it
164311 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one
164312 eu n o disse que ia literalmente surfar na web
164313 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
164314 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
164315 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily
164316 laboratory testing has confirmed that both a sample of serrano pepper and a sample of irrigation water collected by agency investigators on a farm in the state of nuevo leon mexico contain salmonella saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint as the strain of bacteria that is causing the current outbreak in the united states
164317 the farm unit in question ended its harvest more than a month ago so the sample they say they have lacks scientific validity
164318 was taken recently from a tank holding rain water that was not used in production
164319 birth weight gestational age and risks for small gestational age babies and preterm delivery did not differ among infants of women who had conceived both spontaneously and after assisted fertilization
164320 the adverse outcomes of assisted fertilization that we noted compared with those in the general population could therefore be attributable to the factors leading to infertility rather than to factors related to the reproductive technology
164321 considering that 1 to 4 percent of all newborns in europe are conceived after assisted reproductive technology art safety concerns are important reducing the number of multiple births has made improvements but we need to gain a better biological understanding of the reasons why infertility and ovarian stimulation may have adverse effects on infant health consequently we have to continuously monitor the short and long term risks of art
164322 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
164323 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
164324 these are very complex molecular signals and the authors have very nicely shown that there is one molecule laminins 511 that is a very important signal to tell the hair molecule to move through the process its part of a basic biological understanding
164325 mice are not just little men and women they are different than us and also different in their hair
164326 so laminin 511 is an early epithelial message to the dermis to say lets start producing hair
164327 hair is formed as a result of cooperation and communication between the two layers
164328 we knew that the two layers of the skin are important in hair formation and we knew that there was some early epithelial signal hypothesized a long time ago but no one knew what it was until now
164329 the hair follicles are still there but they get stuck in the cycle so its not well understood why theyre stuck and how do you get them unstuck
164330 the hope of course is that you can apply this to humans but there are some cautions in all that biology is very complex there are a lot of checks and balances you dont want hair follicles and cells in hair follicles to be growing too much or not enough the on and off signals that are dampening that and controlling that are very very complex and not well understood this is far far from humans
164331 more than 15 months after the supreme courts order epa once again has ignored its legal and moral obligation to act quickly to protect the health and welfare of americans the bush administration is wasting precious time with continued foot dragging time that we dont have we have gone to court to force action by this or the next administration
164332 scientists are reporting that global climate change is damaging our oceans and our daily lives even more rapidly than forecast
164333 does the epa think climate change will go away by itself well think about it tomorrow is an unconscionable conclusion for an agency whose mission is to protect the environment
164334 the latest bush administration tactic on global warming seems to be if you cant beat them delay them
164335 instead of taking action on global warming pollution from shipping and aviation two of the fastest growing sources of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide epa is yet again putting the brakes on developing innovative global warming solutions
164336 if were going to slow the melting of the arctic and save not only the polar bear but thousands of species around the world we need to implement highly effective existing environmental laws like the clean air act
164337 regulating greenhouse pollution from ships and aircraft under the clean air act is a necessary first step towards solving the climate crisis
164338 there is a reduced association of migraine with aura with this gene but if you have migraine with aura the risk of stroke is magnified
164339 at the moment were not suggesting genotyping for women with migraines with aura the consequences of having this gene are completely unclear right now
164340 the problem here is theyre trying to find the exact gene and theyre getting into the ballpark but to isolate the exact gene is so complicated this might be more of an association rather than a direct cause so until more research is done screening isnt justified
164341 the take home message here is that if you have migraine with aura youre likely have an increased stroke risk and you may want to be more careful
164342 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
164343 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
164344 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
164345 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
164346 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
164347 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that
164348 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
164349 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming

164351 i have tested the computers and am happy with their performance
164352 they are wireless internet based designs and need not be connected to fixed lines to reduce costs they do not have hard discs you use a thumb drive instead
164353 the computers require broadband access and i have told the relevant bodies to speed up the roll out of broadband coverage
164354 if each of the three billion handphone users globally recycle one phone each we can save 240 000 tonnes of raw material from being mined produced and distributed
164355 the amount of greenhouse gases saved would be equivalent to that of removing four million cars from the road
164356 the new kiosks are part of our ongoing commitment to environmental responsibility and one way in which we can make it easier for people to recycle their used and unwanted mobiles in a responsible manner

164401 on this account i could wish that such as are to be baptized should be completely immersed into the water according to the meaning of the word and to the significance of the ordinance not because i think it necessary but because it would be beautiful to have a full and perfect sign of so perfect a thing as also without doubt it was instituted by christ
164402 it is evident that the term baptize means to immerse and that this was the form used by the primitive church
164403 immersion and not sprinkling was unquestionably the original normal form of baptism immersion shows the very meaning of the greek word baptize
164404 immersion was in all probability the way in which our blessed savior was baptized and certainly the most used way of baptism
164405 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
164406 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
164407 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
164408 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
164409 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
164410 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
164411 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
164412 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
164413 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
164414 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering
164415 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
164416 it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death
164417 not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands

164432 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
164433 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
164434 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
164435 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us

164438 there are some tourist areas that are four to five kilometres miles away from the fire but we dont think they are in danger
164439 the starting point of the fire was just near a stream which tourists use for rafting
164440 we had band members leaving we had lots of long term personal relationships f up in the six months prior to the record so it was very much an emotional time
164441 i think richard and laurence might have thought that the leaving band members were stifling some ideas
164442 it sounds kind of clich but with all that stuff on going on instead of making the record dreary we kind of just tried to turn it into a positive the record was certainly heavy and i still feel that now when i listen to the songs but it was about moving on as well you know rather than just becoming stuck in the negativity
164443 i think we were actually one of the first bands theyd signed without actually seeing them live
164444 i think they just took everyone elses word for it rather than actually coming and checking us out
164445 it was weird the first time we actually played in london was the first time anyone from the label had actually seen us so it was quite nerve racking actually
164446 there was no question of make me love you not being melodically great
164447 but it really wasnt all that dangerous and that was one factor that we definitely had to focus on we had to keep things a lot rawer and to keep things unpredictable which i kind of feel like we achieved on this record
164448 having warps stamp of approval really opens up all these new opportunities but you also realise just how small you are
164449 like we just played the smallest of six dance stages at glastonbury and there are like a whole four more areas with just countless stages
164450 so hopefully we can go back there one day and people might actually know who we are

164610 after making the decision to create the tattoo sourcebook i immediately began researching studios and websites that had access to different tattoo designs
164611 i spoke to tattoofinder com owner lou bardach and he thought the sourcebook concept as i presented it was a fantastic idea but it wasnt enough he wanted to give an authoritative and informative introduction to the tattoo process and he couldnt have been more right nearly 2 000 designs and 40 different artists later the tattoo sourcebook was born
164612 we approach these collaborative efforts first and foremost by focusing on our customers needs
164613 we then look for innovative ways to leverage our assets and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies oftentimes valuing our long term goals over short term monetary gains
164614 our decision to work with tattoofinder was based on the incredible volume of traffic their site generates
164615 as well as their solid ethical reputation as the leading source for high quality tattoo designs it takes time for a newer company to build a strong presence on the web and doing so generally requires a huge advertising budget we felt working with tattoofinder com in co branded content distribution was a good move for both parties we look forward to finding other creative ways to work together to enhance each others brand extend our reach and increase industry authority
164616 the secret to our success is giving our visitors exactly what they want in the most clear direct way possible
164617 what our customers want is great tattoo artwork and reliable information and my mission is to make this experience as easy and effective as possible its not some kind of seo trick or backroom dealings with search engines like google in fact its the exact opposite philosophy thats made us successful honesty tattoofinder com has become synonymous with top quality tattoo artwork and authoritative information about the tattoo process simply because thats what we offer nothing more nothing less

164621 we could have simply licensed artwork to harpercollins for the tattoo sourcebook
164622 but we saw an opportunity to work with them more closely to produce and promote a truly epic book we could have simply sold advertising space to inked magazine on our website but saw opportunity in the magazines high end print market we took a creative approach in both cases toward building solid long term business relationships that have benefited us benefited our partners and most importantly benefited our customers

164682 nosotros ya lo asumimos desde que lo supimos hace unas semanas la federaci n ecuestre internacional no se ha pronunciado al respecto
164683 todos los equipos que compiten en hong kong son muy fuertes y con mucha tradici n de concurso completo por lo que para nosotros es un gran honor estar compitiendo en el mismo nivel

164685 pienso que l est adapt ndose bastante bien en doma y salto es muy bueno y cross country es la disciplina que tengo que trabajar m s le falta un poco de preparaci n
164686 las condiciones de las instalaciones son muy buenas pero el calor y la humedad son un problema muy serio y los caballos no consiguen eliminar el calor
164687 en algunas pocas del a o tenemos un clima parecido al de aqu de modo que nuestros caballos tienen alguna experiencia pero en los juegos de sydney o de atlanta aunque pasamos mucho calor no tuvimos esta humedad
164688 en esta partida no est n incluidos ni establecimientos auxiliares como el parque ol mpico ni la villa ol mpica que es un lugar construido para el desarrollo de la ciudad

164694 but what is really sad is that there are no good child care options for families since the modern work place pretends that children dont matter mothers have to get creative
164695 veritable encyclopedia of common sense wisdom a modern day 95 theses nailed to the pre school door
164696 my book gives moms some irreverent but real advice having a fake purse is a twisted solution but if the working world is going to pretend i dont have kids i say we have to find ways to work around it its not the best solution but desperate times call for desperate measures
164697 if you like your kids peanut butter sandwich fried and then dunked in fluff or made from specially picked organic peanuts crushed individually by fully unionized workers youll love the white trash mom handbook by michelle lamar i aspire to the life lessons here especially how to fake it for the bake sale
164698 take it from a yellow trash dad that the white trash mom handbook is a book that you should read actually you dont have to read it just buy it michelle will be just as happy either way as would i be
164699 buy it for your sister in law who gives you the stink eye every time you give your kid an unthawed eggo buy it for the woman in your mommy and me group who makes you feel like crap for not making your 3 year old go to violin french juggling lessons and send another copy to the bitchy chick down the street the white trash mom handbook is not about money or status or education its about giving yourself the freedom to be yourself and that is a good thing indeed
164700 michelle lamars irreverent handbook is a must read for all mothers

164709 art has always been a vital part of my life
164710 having the digital image on my computer is great because it helps me decide if the composition is working and gives me a clearer picture of what the painting will look like when im finished
164711 i use the smaller sketch and photo as my guide as i draw the image onto the canvas
164712 but when i start to paint i work directly from life which i try to do whenever possible i think the whole process really helps me understand the painting
164713 my still life subjects are simple everyday objects that catch my attention
164714 they are items that have been discarded forgotten or passed by because people have lost interest by painting these items i give them new life objects once old and forgotten become interesting to the viewer because they are seen in a different way
164715 i like when realism is taken out of place a bit when it appears somewhat off kilter its not quite surrealism but definitely not total reality
164716 i like for my subjects to occupy the space and i render the space simply i like the paintings to breathe
164717 perhaps the only thing more outrageous than exxon mobil making record profits while americans are paying record prices at the pump is the fact that senator mccain has proposed giving them an additional 1 2 billion tax break while senator mccains plan has succeeded in helping his campaign raise over 1 million from oil and gas company executives and employees just last month it wont lower gas prices or end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil instead of an energy policy that reads like an oil company wish list its time to create a new american energy economy by investing in alternative energy creating millions of new jobs increasing fuel efficiency standards and ending the tyranny of oil once and for all
164718 the mayors lack of understanding of basic leadership skills and of public safety issues has hurt this city immeasurably
164719 in my many opportunities to meet citizens of indianapolis i have often asked who do you think is in charge of public safety i usually get five different answers the bottom line is that there is really no one in charge of public safety
164720 do you feel safer in our city now than you did one year ago
164721 some patients who have been in a coma for a period of time do recover so you cannot write them off unless they are brain dead

164723 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
164724 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
164725 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

164733 it was july in key west and hotter than hell both times we chased permit all over the place and were chased by vigorous tropical storms in turn i loved it and recall being especially floored by the ocean colors which resembled glazes on ancient chinese pottery as we had lots of weather that is where i put the emphasis these are brushy rather fluid things each done in one session
164734 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
164735 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
164736 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
164737 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
164738 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
164739 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
164740 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
164741 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
164742 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
164743 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
164744 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
164745 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
164746 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
164747 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
164748 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
164749 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
164750 create a canvas with a white background at 420 x 300 px then add a transparent layer
164751 im going to describe for you a description of how to use gimp to describe a curved line
164752 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
164753 and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
164754 the development we pursue is peaceful open and co operative in nature
164755 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here

164767 it is critically important for linux to have an easy way for software developers to write to distro n whether its red hat ubuntu or novell
164768 the future of linux that i would love to see is upstream projects adopting our tests
164769 look at a project like ruby and they have a model that when you write code you submit a test along with it it makes the project high quality because of the rigorous tests
164770 the thing that i want to see from the lsb and the linux developer network is a set of dead simple tools so that isvs can take advantage of the standardization work weve done
164771 the standard is not punitive and no one will go to jail if they dont comply with the lsb
164772 there will be application vendors that will want to certify to lsb 4 as there will be broad enough coverage in the specification for them to build multidistribution applications
164773 our tools are a quantum leap ahead of where we used to be
164774 the bar for costs of certifying to linux foundation lsb is largely a development issue
164775 when you certify to a red hat novell or ubuntu the bar is by and large a channel partnership and a support infrastructure which is a higher cost than the development component
164776 grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
164777 weve seen over the past year or two that insecurity has spread to parts of the centre to the west and to parts of the north as well and that is extremely worrying because of course afghanistan is facing a drought

164808 i know how important this funding is to maryland communities often its the difference between life and death first responders protect our homes and communities and the federal government has a responsibility to protect them by providing them with the tools they need to do their jobs safer and smarter
164809 every day when our first responders report for duty they dont know what they will face thats why i fight every year for the equipment training and staffing our protectors and communities deserve
164810 first responders have always been on the front lines keeping our families and our neighborhoods safe from harm i thank these brave men and women for their continuing service and sense of duty to our community
164811 i am proud to support federal investment through local grants like this which is essential to ensure our community heroes have the equipment and training they need to do their jobs safely and efficiently
164812 our international gases and engineering business remains stable so we have every reason to be confident about the future

164821 so id been out of town for a couple of days and just heading to the to have dinner
164822 i think it was saturday or sunday after the accident was my next memory
164823 i just got this awful feeling and i looked at my mom and i said we need to turn off the dvd
164824 i got sick to my stomach and i looked at my mom and im like karge was on the bridge
164825 i just know i feel it i know he was on it and i know hes hurt i know hes not dead but i know he was on it
164826 i look down at my phone and i see four missed calls from him
164827 i just prayed and prayed and prayed and finally about a half hour of doing that i got this feeling like you got to pick yourself up off this bed and go turn the tv on
164828 he was alive thank god for that that was my little miracle in that moment that i needed to keep getting me through those hours
164829 around 11 30 i got a phone call from my aunt saying we found him
164830 he walks up to me and he says alright i need to talk to you
164831 he was just covered in dirt and blood and glass
164832 fractured neck in two places broken clavicle separated shoulder multiple puncture wounds five broken bones in my foot ive had six surgeries to date probably have two to three more to go so i got pretty banged up
164833 id be like you were on a bridge that collapsed
164834 apparently i had the same conversation with people for four days straight asking where am i
164835 youd tell him the whole thing over and it would be the complete shock over and over again
164836 and one day i woke up and started making new memories
164837 not to sound like a martyr or anything but every step i take hurts
164838 cause i cant do anything to fix it or help it or make it go away
164839 this is what i was wearing that day and honestly i have to tell you these were my favorite pair of pants
164840 that would be from the puncture wounds in my knee
164841 i dont know why i kept it to be honest with you it just sits in the basement this is part of a story that i dont remember
164842 id be curious if someone watching this story goes i pulled him out of a car or i got him into the back of a pickup truck or i made sure he got into a hospital er

164878 there is a certain accommodativeness in issuing passports by the authorities in some south indian states like kerala tamil nadu and andhra pradesh particularly kerala which helps people get hold of fraudulent passports
164879 basically there are two problems to this the passport itself can be a forged document or a person can procure an original passport from the passport office by producing fake documents in other words the passport may be original but the contents within might all be fake
164880 this practice has been going on for the last 15 years or so because of people searching for employment abroad

165276 could make it easier for health care institutions and individuals to deny contraceptive services to women who need them
165277 the regulation is so overly broad in scope that it could undermine state laws that seek to ensure the availability of these services even those laws that protect survivors of rape and sexual assault
165278 this proposed regulation will not only lead to unintended pregnancies but will contravene the laws of our state we urge you now to ask the bush administration not to advance this flawed and unnecessary public policy
165279 last year legislators on both sides of the debate over reproductive rights united behind a measure that provides rape survivors with the emergency contraception that could help prevent a pregnancy after a violent attack
165280 gov pawlenty recognized the strong public support behind this common sense measure and signed it into law now just one year after the law took effect we are urging him to call on the bush administration to stop an attack on birth control that would undermine this state law

165287 homokiezers geven vaak net de doorslag voor de verkiezing van een kandidaat zeker door hun grote concentratie in steden en hun actieve stemgedrag
165288 de amerikaanse presidentskandidaat obama gaf onlangs een persbericht uit waarin hij zijn steun aan homo emancipatie nadrukkelijk uitsprak
165289 nog niet eerder deed een presidentskandidaat dit zo openlijk tijdens de homodemonstratie in wenen lopen dit jaar ook voor het eerst politici mee van de groenen in californi lopen ook veel politici mee in de demonstratie die dit jaar vooral gericht is op het homohuwelijk

165291 the brutality of the attack is a hate crime that is my story and i am sticking to it
165292 this teaching is founded in the old and new testament and the fidelity to scripture and to apostolic tradition is absolute homosexuality is a disordered behaviour the activity must be condemned the traditional approach to homosexuality is comprehensive a clear declaration about this theme must come from the anglican communion
165293 kasper was saddened that dialogue between the anglican communion and the roman catholic church had been seriously compromised over the issues of womens ordination and homosexuality these developments had also caused the communion to enter into a period of dispute he observed
165294 many of you are troubled deeply so by the threat of fragmentation in such a scenario who will our dialogue partner be how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations with those who share catholic perspectives on the points currently in dispute and who disagree with some developments within the anglican communion or particular provinces
165295 we are very excited to partner with nona this year for our third annual moonlight serenade gala their work is making such a difference in the lives of families throughout the okanagan and we want to contribute to their efforts
165296 this event has been such a success for the past two years and we have no doubt the community will work with us again to support this cause with the same high level of enthusiasm
165297 everything is premised around waterfront in the okanagan private moorage is a rarity moorage is at a high premium in the area and can be extremely prohibitive having a private place for your boat is a unique privilege that the sheerwater lifestyle affords
165298 his style of dealing with employees is probably something people in my position arent crazy about
165299 but if you look at his history he tends to grow companies he is involved with we are hopeful in that regard
165300 is a real sign of confidence in the brand in our strategic direction
165301 one thing thats the same is that we are executing against a strategic plan that has been in place for a number of years
165302 but this is not likely to offset the losses in the first half of the year
165303 good earth has cafes open throughout alberta with a strategic road map to expand across all of western canada
165304 we are extremely excited by the opening of our first bc location in kelowna on pandosy south the new cafe will allow us to serve our great coffee and great food to new customers as well as to visiting albertans in the area we have strong awareness in alberta and our cafes are easy to operate
165305 i think the kelowna area is the perfect place to open a good earth cafe
165306 more and more people are familiar with the company both local and visiting albertans and i know they will love the good earth concept and service we provide
165307 the secret of making 300 or more per day just doing simple data entry jobs from the comfort of your own home
165308 my wife is from the local area and i am from abbotsford and i was working for sun rype as a buyer working in the co packing group nobody was packaging the way we can with our new machine where we can shrink wrap a product and it doesnt matter how small or large the order it can be done in our operation nothing has been done like this for the commercial trade we went out to find a machine that could do this job just about all over north america when i was at sun rype and we wanted a special packaging we would have to move the product to vancouver for packaging and i wondered at the time if this could work here if we had the right equipment i did a lot of research on the idea and wondered if it could work here i decided it could and bought the right machine we had a selling job to do so that companies could see what increases they could achieve with the right packaging for todays marketplace we can produce a package with the company logo for anyone and six pack or twelve pack a product for the store shelves
165309 we found out there was nobody between vancouver and toronto now there are people doing this type of packaging but they are only doing it for themselves and most equipment is built specifically for one product we on the other hand can do from jams and jellies to larger bottles and everything in between
165310 youre exactly right there are probably 200 businesses that could use the service in the okanagan that are not fully aware of us yet we already have customers that want to get into a market and this will be the way through our packaging it will allow them to do so
165311 it runs the gamut from just rudeness up to pretty extreme abusive behaviors
165312 the severe cases of fatal violence get a lot of press but in some ways this is more insidious because it affects millions of people

165314 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this i would mock him for being an out of touch elitist and make jokes like if you think thats a lot you should see how much his purse costs i would send the link to drudge and wait for instapundit to pick it up and then watch gleefully as fox news ran segments about how barack obamas 500 loafers vitiate his entire economic platform

165316 developers rajat and jayant agarwalla launched wordscraper worldwide less than 48 hours after being forced to take their original creation scrabulous offline in the us and canada in response to a lawsuit from hasbro the brothers voluntarily closed scrabulous to north american users on tuesday following a claim of intellectual property infringement by games manufacturer hasbro which owns the online rights in the us and canada they have now launched wordscraper with significant changes to make the game less like scrabble

165322 lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to awaken him jesus spoke about his death but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep
165323 for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him
165324 what derek and i have done is just hang out we dont really take things too seriously until we get to the field
165325 just that family connection after football makes it a really good team
165326 we break down film together we see what the weaknesses are on the other team and what are the strong points
165327 we have a good friendship and we work on a lot of timing stuff in the off season so it makes it a lot easier on me i know where hes going to be and he knows what im going to do
165328 i was expecting a big day jay head coach christensen lets me go back there and throw as much as i want and lets me help with the play calling if i get to throw it 34 times a game i should be putting up numbers like that
165329 i was rushing things a bit last year at times trying to make a play but this year i know ive got receivers that are going to catch the ball and help me out
165330 we came together over the off season pretty good we trained together and came to practices on wednesdays and we all hung out together
165331 we all got a little bit older and a little bit stronger and faster and i knew we were going to play well
165332 why on earth would we recreate the same painful experiences and do this to ourselves
165333 because the pleasure centres are firing so freely the enamoured person falls in love not only with the beloved but with the world and romanticizes his view of it things that normally bother us dont we love being in love not only because it makes it easy for us to be happy but also because it makes it harder for us to be unhappy
165334 we really need to discuss your level of commitment to what you value in life i know that you want to move forward however your behaviour is demonstrating to me that you could be falling into patterns from the past what i know to be true about you is that you desire something much better for yourself so lets look at your underlying motivation and why you arent doing the things in life that nurture you
165335 i dont know why i do this when i know that these things are really important in my life i just dont seem to have the time or the energy anymore
165336 what the heck why not give internet dating a try what have i got to lose
165337 the combination of outdoor recreation the visual and culinary arts with wine has enabled the okanagan summer wine festival to occupy a wonderful niche for wine tourism
165338 silver star is a great location for wine tourists to be hosted the resort offers first class accommodation wonderful hiking mountain biking and restaurants and cafes to act as the host resort for this unique wine festival is a perfect fit as we continue to develop our summer season
165339 thats not true at all were just putting back up a couple that blew down in the last storm
165340 and its just us who own billboards there there are three or four organizations everybody thinks weve got them all but thats not the case
165341 were looking at mega types of developments its not going to be too long before were going to be looking at high rises and thatll be a new feature
165342 police believe that schaefer and the suspect or suspects knew each other
165343 schaefer has only had one encounter with the criminal justice system in previous years
165344 there was no cooperation from him or a friend of his now we are pursuing the line of questions again in light of his death hopefully that will change their attitude with respect to their cooperation
165345 the determining factor in schaefers death was his bodys inability to fight off infection of the surgery performed to remedy the complications from the assault
165346 the fire extended from some of the machinery area and moved into the bins where all the sawdust is stored looks like the crews will be tied up for a while
165347 were setting up for the long run because its a deep seeded fire and you dont want to put manpower in there until the area is cooled down

165352 he turned himself in and confessed to murdering his sister to cleanse his familys honour because she disappeared from home for four months with a man
165353 he killed her the moment she returned home last night but forensic tests showed that the girl was a virgin
165354 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time
165355 there was a fight between two families and we understand he was shot dead by a member of one of the families
165356 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
165357 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
165358 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who could have been a good australian citizen
165359 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
165360 and if we wouldnt have sent him away he may well be alive and well amongst us at the moment

165374 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
165375 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
165376 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
165377 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family

165420 these observations give the strongest evidence to date that water still flows occasionally on the surface of mars
165421 the shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water
165422 they have finger like branches at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles
165423 these fresh deposits suggest that at some places and times on present day mars liquid water is emerging from beneath the ground and briefly flowing down the slopes this possibility raises questions about how the water would stay melted below ground how widespread it might be and whether theres a below ground wet habitat conducive to life future missions may provide the answers

165444 the ethical problems of using eggs can be circumvented with induced pluripotent stem ips cells which are adult cells reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells in 2006 scientists created such cells from mice and rats by introducing a combination of four genes to a culture of skin cells then last year scientists showed that they could do the same thing with human cells the new study published online today by science shows that ips cells can be successfully generated even from the skin cells of an elderly sick person eggan says
165445 you just feel part of nature this is so rare

165447 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
165448 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
165449 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
165450 but i didnt turn out to have any special genius so i cant say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me

165459 our work shows that the original method developed by yamanaka works great
165460 it opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines to treat diseases that affect people very late in life like parkinsons or alzheimers disease
165461 our lack of understanding of the disease process is preventing us from developing more efficient cures
165462 because the disease is happening in the spinal cord we dont have access to living samples of neurons undergoing the disease process but now we have in the culture dish the very cells affected by the disease
165463 we found that in fish that do have temperature dependent sex determination tsd a rise in water temperature of just 1 5 degrees celsius can change the male to female ratio from 1 1 to 3 1
165464 if climate change really does result in a rise of 4 degrees which is the maximum the ipcc predicts and if species cant adapt in time or migrate then in the most sensitive cases of tsd were looking at extinction
165465 it could be because of chemical pollution or it could be because of climate change we dont know
165466 recommended that pregnant women breastfeeding mothers and young children avoid eating fish with a high mercury content gt 1 ppm such as shark swordfish tilefish and king mackerel this also includes fresh and frozen tuna mercury content between 0 5 ppm and 1 5 ppm but not canned tuna which consists of smaller shorter lived species with lower mercury levels
165467 no harmful effects have been reported from thimerosal at doses used in vaccines
165468 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism
165469 because of the beneficial effects of fish consumption the long term goal needs to be a reduction in the concentration of mercury in fish rather than the replacement of fish in the diet by other less healthier food in the interim the best method of maintaining fish consumption and minimizing mercury exposure is the consumption of fish known to have lower methyl mercury concentrations
165470 on the one hand alzheimers disease is a complex pathologic process and that is daunting
165471 but now we are beginning to segregate out different therapeutic targets and develop drugs that have an impact on each target so in combination they may handle the disease better than any single approach
165472 we established the association but when it comes to explaining it we can only speculate at this state
165473 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
165474 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones

165477 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
165478 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill
165479 almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise for these people if there was a way to mimic exercise it would make the quality of exercise they do more efficient
165480 no business in asia would even think of keeing its financial data at a third party data center because the only way to guarantee secrecy and to prevent the authorities from seeing the data is to keep total control of the financial database at all times

165486 geobooks on demand is an on line erp system designed specifically for businesses who need world class accounting planning and control capabilities but cant justify the cost and complexity of high end erp software packages
165487 a key goal of erp systems is to enable information sharing in conjunction with effective governance safeguards so everyone in the business has a single bona fide version of the truth but this can become a huge challenge when a business operates in many countries time zones and languages most erp offerings available today were never originally designed with the needs of multinational businesses in mind even today the majority of low cost and on demand solutions just cant handle basic requirements like multiple currencies and languages nor do they provide the necessary precautions to protect the integrity of corporate data
165488 we chose geobooks on demand because of its multi company multi currency and multi language capabilities and because it allows us to comply with local accounting requirements while doing all the currency translation consolidation and financial reporting we need for our global operations
165489 geobooks on demand will replace three separate quickbooks installations with a single erp system that is always available can be accessed in any language from our offices in hong kong and thailand and allows us to instantly monitor the performance of our entire business

165506 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
165507 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
165508 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
165509 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
165510 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
165511 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

165531 in a paper recently published in the journal animal behaviour smith a student in msus department of zoology shows that while spotted hyenas know the value of living together in large cooperative societies they also realize that venturing on their own now and then to hunt for food is often the key to their survival
165532 although spotted hyenas are 20 percent more likely to capture prey with one or more members of their social group cooperative hunting results in multiple new competitors showing up because former allies quickly turn into noisy competitors once the kill is made
165533 so its the individual especially if he or she is low in the hierarchy that suffers a cost for having group members at that prey

165613 last night two persons came to me in a dream and woke me up and said to me proceed i set out with them and we came across a man lying down and behold another man was standing over his head holding a big rock behold he was throwing the rock at the mans head injuring it the rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back by the time he reached the man his head returned to the normal state the thrower then did the same as he had done before i said to my two companions subhan allah who are these two persons they said proceed so we proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook and behold he would put the hook in one side of the mans mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back of the neck and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back then he turned to the other side of the mans face and did just as he had done with the other side he hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before i said to my two companions subhan allah who are these two persons they said to me proceed so we proceeded and came across something like a tannur a kind of baking oven a pit usually clay lined for baking bread
165614 in that oven t here was much noise and voices
165615 we looked into it and found naked men and women and behold a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath and when it reached them they cried loudly i asked them who are these they said to me proceed and so we proceeded and came across a river
165616 and behold in the river there was a man swimming and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones
165617 so we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked the gatekeeper to open the gate and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen my two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river behold there was a river flowing across the city and its water was like milk in whiteness those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness of their bodies had disappeared and they became in the best shape
165618 my two companions angels said to me this place is the eden paradise and that is your place i raised up my sight and behold there i saw a palace like a white cloud my two companions said to me that palace is your place i said to them may allah bless you both let me enter it they replied as for now you will not enter it but you shall enter it one day i said to them i have seen many wonders tonight what does all that mean which i have seen they replied we will inform you as for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock he is the symbol of the one who studies the quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders and sleeps neglecting the enjoined prayers as for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world and those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven they are the adulterers and the adulteresses and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow is the eater of usury riba and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it is malik the gatekeeper of hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden is abraham and the children around him are those children who die with al fitra the islamic faith
165619 my two companions added the men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad but allah forgave them

165645 it doesnt really matter whether you can quantify your results what matters is that you rigorously assemble evidence quantitative or qualitative to track your progress if the evidence is primarily qualitative think like a trial lawyer assembling the combined body of evidence if the evidence is primarily quantitative then think of yourself as a laboratory scientist assembling and assessing the data to throw our hands up and say but we cannot measure performance in the social sectors the way you can in a business is simply lack of discipline all indicators are flawed whether qualitative or quantitative what matters is not finding the perfect indicator but settling upon a consistent and intelligent method of assessing your output results and then tracking your trajectory with rigor

165675 on a common way forward to conclude these negotiations as soon as possible
165676 to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals such as the resumption of iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further reduction of u s combat forces from iraq
165677 the agreement will look at goal dates for transition of responsibilities and missions
165678 the focus is on the iraqi assumption of missions not on what troop levels will be
165679 progress between the united states and iraq on a time horizon for american troop presence is further evidence that the surge has succeeded if we had followed sen obamas policy iraq would have descended into chaos american casualties would be far higher and the region would be destabilized
165680 its another indication that the administration is moving toward sen obamas position on negotiating the removal of our forces as part of our ongoing discussions with the iraqi government
165681 after rejecting 18 months of attempts by the democratic majority in congress to adopt redeployment timetables the president now proposes a vague general time horizon that falls far short of a commitment to ending our involvement in iraq
165682 obviously if iraqis are assuming more missions then you need less american troops
165683 i think its important to remember that the discussions about timeline issues previously were from democrats in congress who wanted to arbitrarily retreat from iraq without consideration of conditions on the ground
165684 all of the discussions that we have always had have been based on conditions on the ground and making progress in the country and we are doing just that
165685 we are making progress on the security situation the number of attacks has dropped dramatically in recent months

166193 its backed up by the reality of his tour around the world he has many fans
166194 the question that we are posing to the american people is this is he ready to lead yet and the answer to the question that we will offer to the american people is no that he is not
166195 although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
166196 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another

166274 palestinian localities evacuated and destroyed after the 1948 arab israeli war
166275 in years to come historians will be shocked at how israeli leaders happily encouraged a gang of arab murderers to create a country within our tiny borders a country which never existed before and gave them arms knowing that those arms could be used to kill and maim us and then continued to try to appease the murderers why are we fulfilling hitlers dream why did we ignore arafats rhetoric calling for our destruction ignore the fact that they were flooding their cities with arms and ignore the warnings that they are preparing for all out war
166276 it takes two to make a fight so i must deserve this abuse after all im not perfect either i left dishes in the sink was talking on the phone when he came home and didnt have dinner ready on time sometimes i was a little confused after he beat me up and didnt function so well these sins of mine are so enormous that whatever he does is justified i should have done better should have known should have anticipated
166277 as penance for not being perfect we must allow them to continue murdering us
166278 if hes so angry it means that im to blame people dont get angry about nothing it must be that i havent done enough to please him if i just try harder im sure ill eventually win his love
166279 no matter how badly he acts at times i truly believe that he doesnt really mean to hurt me and that he really does love me underneath it all he just has to act like this to prove his masculinity it doesnt really mean anything because underneath it all theres a good man

166289 we have all made mistakes we have all erred and we ought not try to sugar coat when we err

166296 slavery and jim crow are stains upon what is the greatest nation on the face of the earth
166297 is such a resolution as we have before us today where we face up to our mistakes and apologize as anyone should apologize for things that were done in the past that were wrong
166298 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch the leadership of both parties must step up to condemn such hateful speech and demand apologies the obama campaign has criticized the lyrics but we call on the presumptive party nominee who is the celebrated subject of the new song to go even further publicly condemn the song demand an apology on behalf of the targets now
166299 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

166306 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
166307 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
166308 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries

166331 a senior israeli medic who took part in samir kuntars capture after his 1979 terror attack in nahariya also took part in his medical and psychological profiling afterwards

166509 there are serious questions about whether we have an underreporting of workplace injuries
166510 the clear difference is that donnan is pushing a pro union agenda for north carolina and thats something that cherie berry stands adamantly in opposition to
166511 it shocks me that in this particular sector weve seen that drop in inspections
166512 because its one of the sectors that has been most problematic

166521 they need an accessible contact where answers to questions can be easily obtained whether their issues are insurance banking or credit a huge bureaucratic office run by the federal government is not the answer last year the maine bureau of insurance handled 11 079 consumer calls and was able to obtain approximately 1 562 860 in restitution to consumers i dont see this happening if the federal government is in control
166522 an optional charter is designed to give companies the opportunity to follow the path of least regulation this will erode consumer protection state regulators will not be able to help consumers with coverage from a federally licensed insurer the optional charter is equally bad for industry the ability to choose and change regulation is a disadvantage to smaller maine companies who may find that they do not have the resources either financially or otherwise to change regulatory control
166523 we will go back to moderate and normal interest rates in six to 12 months time we will get out of this trough
166524 banks must find ways to mitigate the burden of high interest rate and adopt methods like mobilising low cost deposits

166536 we have got things in motion the difficulty is in getting real quality players everybody is finding the same all the clubs of a similar position to ourselves are in exactly the same boat
166537 what i will say is that we are working as hard as we possibly can to improve our squad which is what we need to do
166538 the fact is we need to improve our squad to stand still never mind anything else thats the difficulty
166539 we finished sixth last season and for us to stand still we need to improve the squad
166540 so for us to go forward we are looking at a sizeable squad and quality players if we can do it that is our aim for us to really make progress we have got to improve the side the strength and the quality of the squad

166556 we still believe the uk is more likely to virtually stagnate than fall into outright recession though particularly if the recent plunge in oil prices which has not yet been captured by survey data is maintained
166557 racy multiples as might be expected given the single digit p e on which anite itself trades but we believe there will be a sense of relief that the unit has gone and that management can continue to work on removing the conglomerate discount
166558 we are pleased to see anite finally moving ahead with reshaping the group and still believe there is significant value locked within the company
166559 sterling had farmed out much of the cost in this well whilst disappointing this well was never going to be a transformational event unlike the madagascar and kurdistan wells likely in 2009

166561 they are in many ways the male and female nexus of what is cool
166562 they have a cache among people who are very savvy and like good art whatever that art is
166563 they played it just perfectly the first time through and she sang it beautifully
166564 i thought they would sound really good together but i had no idea they would be so simpatico
166565 i had made an a cappella version of the beatles i should have known better
166566 and he had recorded it too and we were like what
166567 once we got to see each others process in the studio recording the song for the film we sort of realized that this is somebody who is involved in music for the same reasons that i am
166568 participating in this tradition of expressing oneself and that its not about being a star
166569 all these sorts of things that maybe a lot of people would think were silly or idealistic matt actually totally agrees with it
166570 eventually i heard her demos and its so rare that you come across songs that nobodys heard before that are great
166571 she steered the boat for vocals and i steered the boat as far as the production of those different instruments drums strings guitar and keyboards go
166572 i think deschanels songs definitely toe the line between old and new in a really interesting way
166573 and because her voice has that classic sound it lends itself i think to that interpretation
166574 zooey is one of the most uncynical people that ive ever met
166575 people have no reason to believe that i would be able to write music
166576 i dont hold any grudge against someone who is surprised
166577 im especially surprised to hear one from somebody who makes their living as an actor or anybody outside of music
166578 no gift basket necessary the gift is a great album of music
166579 the tragedy of carmen a condensed 80 minute adaptation of the bizet favorite
166580 carmen this was on its own terms a well sung capably directed and readily enjoyable evening that seemed true to the organizations broader mission it also marked a milestone as the groups first fully staged production
166581 the tragedy of carmen may make its best impression on audiences with no prior exposure to the bizet original as brook jettisons acres of memorable music and takes major liberties with plot though some of them can nominally be tied back to the original merimee novella on which the opera is based
166582 a musical showcase featuring col jack moelmann and friends at the mighty wurlitzer theatre pipe organ
166583 one day back in february i looked in the mirror and said jack you have a dream go for it
166584 not to argue with myself i have personally rented radio city music hall for an organ program the likes of which has not been done in years if ever
166585 im going there to gratify myself by playing and to show off what the music hall has in the way of an organ
166586 we do not have any record of having rented the music hall directly to an individual in the past however we have no formal policy that would preclude us from doing so and all bookings are addressed on a case by case basis
166587 i really dont decide what im going to play until i get there and see whats going to work
166588 we dont print exactly whats being played we announce it we talk in between the numbers make little jokes otherwise it gets kind of boring watching the back of somebody
166589 and then i will be able to say ive played in all the good places in the country
166590 its what i do when i come home to unwind even in this heat
166591 you miss those little things from home like just doing your own dishes in your own kitchen or eating at your own kitchen table
166592 when you quit your full time job to be a musician you better learn how to cook theres no more meals out all the time
166593 people think of gospel from the r amp b and soul angle there wasnt anybody doing gospel with a country or blues aspect
166594 its such an original mix of music i dont think they even realize it themselves i dont hear that sort of mixture of country stylings and gospel very often their arrangements are just terrific too very original it just had this great spirit about it
166595 afterward jim said anytime you want to record that band let me know
166596 it is work it is an effort but im glad this is documented its an important project anyone whos a roots music fan would appreciate all the different people playing
166597 i talk about my albums as being my children with the shakers it was like we cant have another kid we need to make ends meet but its like were this poor family but theres love and well get by
166598 whatever denomination whether youre atheist religious or whatever theres something about gospel music thats compelling
166599 especially these older songs hank williams singing gospel how can you go wrong
166600 maybe we could do a for one month only thing
166601 the wins paper not only outlines the realities and challenges for female neurosurgeons but offers viable solutions targeted at resolving these inequities the paper touches on the fact that that the number of neurosurgeons appears to be decreasing relative to a growing population and that there is an urgent need to attract more qualified candidates to address this potential shortage failure to attract the brightest and most talented in the applicant pool by exclusions of subtle and deniable discrimination is unacceptable this is an issue that affects the specialty as a whole and inevitably our patients and we intend to work together to resolve it
166602 while some small strides have been made female neurosurgeons comprise just an estimated 5 9 percent of the neurosurgical workforce
166603 the first female neurosurgeon received board certification from the american board of neurological surgeons abns in 1960 and there are only 189 abns certified female neurosurgeons in the united states today
166604 it is important to keep in mind that many of the changes recommended in this paper are likely to benefit all neurosurgeons irrespective of gender and will help ensure the future viability of our specialty given the challenges facing neurosurgery and academic medicine in general wins joins with all of organized neurosurgery in the desire to see neurosurgery continue to grow and prosper
166605 i want to see with my own eyes because its really hot in the news so i came on a bus with the neighbours
166606 to set out to make a lot of money for its own sake without a bigger goal is to doom yourself to a life of disappointment
166607 if you each focus too much on your careers to the exclusion of your marriage all the extra income in the world wont undo the damage you can do to your relationship
166608 in the stillness of your presence you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form you can then feel the same life deep within every other human this is the realization of oneness this is love

166611 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
166612 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
166613 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
166614 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

166622 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
166623 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
166624 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar

166627 aligning the departments are necessary because when we give people the land they need to be supported in terms of agricultural production
166628 if you approve the purchase of a citrus farm you may find that you are going to lose three years of harvesting because of a year delay for providing agricultural products
166629 this is not only negatively effects government but causes a delay in agricultural production
166630 it is our view that this move will iron out a lot of challenges that were hindering the pace of land redistribution
166631 i believe that a judge needs to understand and i do understand that a courtroom does not provide political balance politics should never come into the equation once you go through those doors and the witnesses are put under oath it should not matter i understand that

166634 wed love men with beards or facial hair lamb chops or big sideburns that sort of thing
166635 most of the people chosen would be required for almost the full two week duration so we need people who have some flexibility in their work or time to allow that to happen
166636 its a great shame as the paths are for people to enjoy
166637 they the council usually clear it but as it is now you cant walk the path in some areas
166638 unlike other parts of the path the section from benllech to red wharf bay is surfaced so it wouldnt be unduly affected by surface vegetation
166639 brambles and grass have grown through the verges and handrails
166640 in comparison sections around moelfre and the north coast of the island can become far more densely overgrown if not cut regularly
166641 we are trying the best we can and we will go down there and clear this as soon as we can
166642 the brambles are growing at a horrendous rate at this time of the year

166659 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
166660 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
166661 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
166662 the implication is that foreign journalists should refrain from reporting stories that the government finds critical

166671 5 31 procent is een rentevoet die de muntonwaarding door de stijgende inflatie kan opvangen in het kb is van dit laatste voorstel niets terug te vinden blijkbaar zou de minister tijdens de maand september opnieuw willen nadenken over dit voorstel
166672 zonder een koppeling met de getrouwheidspremie is er geen evenwicht en blijft de spaarder in de kou staan de commissie staakte de verdere behandeling van het wetsvoorstel onder belofte van een kb van de minister met deze beide bepalingen

166684 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time
166685 there was a fight between two families and we understand he was shot dead by a member of one of the families
166686 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
166687 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
166688 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who could have been a good australian citizen
166689 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
166690 it is possible the driver was not aware they had hit somebody and we would like them to come forward so we can better piece together the tragic circumstances surrounding this incident

166696 we want to continue to have a dialogue with them and work with them
166697 we want to save them because they are part of our heritage
166698 theyre worth saving for the next generation we dont need any more parking lots
166699 this board is going to make one of the most important decisions ever if you tear these buildings down youll have the domino effect
166700 people are concerned about spending village money to rebuild buildings without knowing what its going to cost if they do this is small town usa whos going to buy them
166701 its going to take 85 000 to stabilize them 150 000 to put new roofs on and then another 150 000 minimum to finish the inside three local contractors have looked at them and say its a cost prohibitive project the north side buildings need to be removed the buildings got a hole in the roof and the second floor is falling into the first floor
166702 what we dont want to see happen is someone come in and buy a building and try to flip it to make a thousand bucks
166703 any sale after stabilization would have contingencies on completing interior work with a time frame
166704 after the second or third meeting we decided on tearing them down but we needed to know what it would cost
166705 we learned a lot about free standing versus common walls liabilities and rules and regulations that applied to government owned buildings a demolition veteran wouldnt put pencil to paper but said 500 000 maybe more to tear down all the buildings
166706 we look at hundreds of buildings a year across illinois
166707 it might be only to recommend a paint scheme but often it is to determine structural soundness
166708 there are tax incentives and grant money available for rehabilitation projects to tear them town is a waste of history and money
166709 i retired from the chicago area and lived in a place that wasnt bad but every time you wanted to go somewhere you had to fight traffic this is a beautiful place
166710 we have to remain attractive if we want to attract more people and business we cant do that by tearing down more buildings
166711 part of getting that district was to build new homes and bring young families to save our schools
166712 im a business owner i think it would be wonderful to save what we have but we cant forget we have to improve growth of new residents with children
166713 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
166714 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
166715 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team
166716 our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us
166717 we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
166718 we have put our contingency plan into action and have been trying to make contact with people who have weddings here and a christening

166720 perbuatan mana mana individu muslim sama ada pemimpin atau rakyat yang meletakkan kalungan bunga tabik hormat dan bertafakur yang dilakukan untuk tugu negara adalah bercanggah dengan prinsip prinsip akidah islam yang anti kepada sebarang unsur keberhalaan
166721 sekiranya pun pelakunya tidak mempunyai sebarang iktikad bahawa itu semua memberi manfaat dan mudarat maka perbuatan itu adalah sia sia dan bodoh ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin
166722 akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar

166726 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
166727 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
166728 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
166729 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
166730 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
166731 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
166732 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
166733 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
166734 dozens of bullas from the period already have been found some of which turned out to be fakes
166735 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur

166746 en toen we aan sofia gekoppeld werden vloekten we nog harder
166747 als je levski sofia loot in de derde voorronde van de champions league dan weet je dat dat geen onhaalbare kaart is
166748 maar we zijn eigenlijk nog niet bezig met die match dat zou erg onrespectvol zijn want we focussen op de match bij borisov we staan niet in de beste uitgangspositie
166749 we moeten de spelersgroep klaar krijgen om in wit rusland de situatie nog om te buigen dat levski sofia wacht kan een extra motivatie zijn
166750 we have managed to discover and dismantle a method of introducing heroin by sea which was unknown to date even at the european level which is especially dangerous
166751 semuanya masih dalam perbincangan kita kena buat majlis akan sumpah ini secara teratur
166752 bukan mudah untuk menjalankannya kami sedang berusaha ke arah itu
166753 saya baru dapat tahu tentang perkara ini semalam beri saya ruang untuk berjumpa dengan saiful untuk berbincang lanjut
166754 saiful akan bersumpah dan pihak media akan dimaklumkan mengenainya buat masa ini biar polis menjalankan siasatan tanpa sebarang gangguan
166755 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
166756 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
166757 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
166758 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
166759 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control

166766 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
166767 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
166768 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
166769 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
166770 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
166771 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
166772 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
166773 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
166774 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
166775 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
166776 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
166777 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
166778 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
166779 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
166780 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
166781 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
166782 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
166783 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
166784 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
166785 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
166786 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
166787 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
166788 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
166789 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that
166790 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
166791 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
166792 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
166793 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
166794 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
166795 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
166796 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
166797 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
166798 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
166799 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
166800 we hope that iran will choose cooperation instead of increasing isolation and will give us in the following days a response that the international community is waiting for

166804 you dig one ditch you better dig two cause the trap you set just may be for you
166805 its a great shame as the paths are for people to enjoy
166806 they the council usually clear it but as it is now you cant walk the path in some areas
166807 unlike other parts of the path the section from benllech to red wharf bay is surfaced so it wouldnt be unduly affected by surface vegetation
166808 brambles and grass have grown through the verges and handrails
166809 in comparison sections around moelfre and the north coast of the island can become far more densely overgrown if not cut regularly
166810 we are trying the best we can and we will go down there and clear this as soon as we can
166811 the brambles are growing at a horrendous rate at this time of the year

166818 unsere vorstellungen von gerechtigkeit an den konomischen bedingungen in einer zeit der globalisierung ausrichtet dieser kurs muss neu gefunden werden das ist im hamburger programm der spd sicher nicht ausreichend gestaltet worden
166819 es ist sicher von vorteil dass wir zuerst ausw rts antreten und es h tte mit legia warschau oder yb bern auch schlimmer kommen k nnen unser klares ziel bleibt dass wir in den uefa cup einziehen wollen sollte das olympiastadion berlin wegen des konzertes von madonna nicht zur verf gung stehen werden wir wieder in den jahnsportpark ausweichen in dem wir bereits in der ersten runde gute erfahrungen gemacht haben
166820 die aufgabe unserer scouts wird sein m glichst viele informationen ber den gegner zu sammeln wir wollen in den uefa cup einziehen und deswegen m ssen wir uns auch gegen ljubljana durchsetzen

166826 i am looking forward to returning to america fighting again at the mgm grand and challenging maglignaggi for his title
166827 las vegas is like a second home to me the fans treat me like gold and i promise them another exciting value for money fight
166828 i am thrilled to be involved in the biggest 140 pound fight of 08
166829 hatton is an aggressive puncher who swarms his opponents from start to finish while malignaggi is one of the purest boxers in the game today as a fan i am excited to see if hatton can lure malignaggi into a brawl or if malignaggi can dictate the tempo and make the fight his no matter what happens i think when their styles collide its going to make for great action and great drama
166830 paulie malignaggi is a champion and an elite fighter i am thrilled that he will be able to achieve superstardom when he fights ricky one of the worlds most popular and accomplished fighters
166831 ricky hatton and paul malignaggi are two fighters who put it all on the line each time they enter the ring this is an important fight for both of their careers
166832 we welcome the return of ricky hatton and his supporters to mgm grand in november as well as the opportunity to host paulie malignaggis las vegas debut we have no doubt this could be one of the most exciting events of 2008 for the fans as well as our customers and look forward to an electric atmosphere inside the mgm grand garden arena
166833 the findings of the survey show intermediaries as realistic but not unduly disheartened they recognise that mortgage volumes will be lower in the year ahead than they have been in the past and that they need to adjust their business models accordingly for example relying on technology to a greater extent to handle applications

166836 since the conception the packs have been surrounded by a catalogue of disasters and so far rather than helping to improve the home buying and selling process they have served as a hindrance and nothing more than a purposeless piece of red tape
166837 the launch of hips onto the marketplace was far from smooth with delays and u turns together with a fundamental error on timing
166838 indeed the debate still rages whether the timing of the launch has had a crippling effect on what is already a rocky time for the property industry
166839 indeed there is still no clarity on the long term plans for the abolition of first day marketing scheduled initially for december 1st last year
166840 at a time when the market place needs stabilisers many of our members believe that this legislation and the cack handed way it has been introduced has had a destabilising effect on market confidence
166841 it seems that there is a major problem obtaining the details required for a hip
166842 they are hard to get hold of quickly and cheaply particularly the leasehold information and searches from local authorities
166843 we have long opposed the imposition of hips and have always seen them as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process
166844 quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes
166845 however im confident that by working with the minister together with all the other key bodies in the industry we shall be able to rectify the situation and come up with a system that works cohesively and efficiently for both buyers and sellers
166846 you wont remember this first week because of the sleep deprivation

166853 the poster became an important medium for propaganda during this period combining text and bold graphics posters were extensively deployed both in germany and in the areas occupied their typography reflected the nazis preference for fraktur over modern sans serif typefaces which were condemned as cultural bolshevism although futura continued to be used owing to its practicality the use of fraktur was prevalent in advertising which was a state monopoly and books published during the third reich

166867 5 31 procent is een rentevoet die de muntonwaarding door de stijgende inflatie kan opvangen in het kb is van dit laatste voorstel niets terug te vinden blijkbaar zou de minister tijdens de maand september opnieuw willen nadenken over dit voorstel
166868 zonder een koppeling met de getrouwheidspremie is er geen evenwicht en blijft de spaarder in de kou staan de commissie staakte de verdere behandeling van het wetsvoorstel onder belofte van een kb van de minister met deze beide bepalingen
166869 dit dient te gebeuren bij wet indien na het parlementair reces de minister geen initiatief neemt zal ik het voorstel indienen in de kamer

166875 stand up for youre civil rights we dont want the christian right
166876 the partys central committee decided not to form a government after the presidential election it is clear that we have no majority so we have no basis for forming the future government
166877 the decision by the maoists to stay in the opposition is a setback to the peace process if the maoists remain in his position will be complications
166878 no party has a clear majority but being the largest party the maoists have the right to form government and also have to earn the confidence of other parties
166879 have to bring the maoists to the government as it is to keep alive the peace process
166880 a minority government in which the maoists are not will not be stable
166881 im not sure how realistic going back to the jungles is im not sure what they would have to gain by that for one and the guns and the pla are still under un lock and key in cantonments
166882 the government has stopped providing allowances to the pla our fighters are facing untold miseries and if that continued it will exhaust our patience
166883 after placing the maoist combatants within the cantonments all the arms and ammunition except those required for providing security to the cantonments shall be securely stored and the keys to the single lock shall remain with the side concerned the pla the un shall monitor the process of placing the weapons under a single lock by keeping records and fitting a device along with a siren in case of need to examine the weapons placed under the single lock the un shall do so under the presence of the concerned side all the technical details along with camera monitoring shall be prepared under the joint agreement of the un cpn maoist and the government of nepal
166884 the peoples war was always against the monarchy and for a nepalese republic and now that this has is being realised i dont think returning to the hills to fight against that is a realistic option for the maoists
166885 its interesting to notice that congress is utilizing the madhesi chuvanism in order to stop maoists from making the government
166886 abimael guzman like alberto fujimori was a beast who cared little for the lives of people i cant believe youre so naive as to take his bullshit seriously
166887 and you reckon they were good old fashioned revolutionaries who had the people in the forefront of their mind
166888 capitalism cannot be destroyed without some form of violent struggle
166889 that sort of armchair revolutionary talk is pathetic and discredits hard working left wingers who dont make excuses for their parties inabilities to win sizable shares of the vote
166890 the vast majority of the democratic and libertarian socialist left today regard marxists as far left fascists
166891 like it or not after 90 years of mass murder this is now an established concrete historical materialist fact
166892 so just as very few are going to complain about direct action against any known far right fascist so your an intelligent guy so i dont have to draw you a diagram
166893 a broad left coalition stretching from social liberals community activists and former national party members to social democrats democratic socialists and left wing radicals
166894 if i could get a message to him i would say that i didnt mean to cause such a stir
166895 i contacted virgin radio because i know christian is friends with roger from some charity work they did together and hes not the easiest person to contact
166896 christian and family values as well as standing for social justice
166897 i just wanted to note that im in ram and am not a member of sw
166898 indeed my ideological background has never even pretended to be revolutionary nor has ram as a party for that matter
166899 ram is not socialist worker and the vast bulk of our 3000 members are not socialist worker members
166900 im proud to draw my apparently unsophisticated ideological influences from folk like bruce jesson doctor w
166901 best of luck in your partys opportunistic participation in this years bourgeois elections
166902 3 your use of the word liberal is very confusing what do you mean by liberal do you mean people who want more individual rights like classical liberals or are you talking about social liberals
166903 4 clearly you havent read ha joon chang george grant et al being a nationalist doesnt make one like capitalism bro resist such simplistic manichean dichotomies of couunfettered rse if maoist movements in china peru nepal and or india behave in an avowedly nationalist fashion theyre clearly not counted right
166904 5 i dont want to challenge capitalism in a revolutionary manner nor do the rest of ram because that is not how change is brought like nelson mandela realised during his captivity attributed somewhat by him to becoming more of a gardener he realised that change has to come from the grassroots quite literally and slowly for it to be meaningful and positive
166905 wouldnt it be better to have a society where everyone has well paying jobs where everyone has access to good education first class healthcare warm and safe homes and can live in peace and harmony
166906 and id sure as hell prefer that to getting my hands chopped off under camino luminoso style anarcho communism
166907 we had a white jury in there we live in a black and white world

166918 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
166919 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
166920 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
166921 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
166922 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
166923 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
166924 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
166925 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
166926 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
166927 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
166928 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
166929 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
166930 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off

166944 ik ben doodop ik kan zelfs een training van twintig minuten niet afwerken en zo gaat het al twee weken lang ik heb koorts moet overgeven en heb constant hoofdpijn
166945 ik kon niet anders dan forfait geven voor het olympisch tornooi ik hoop opnieuw fit te zijn tegen de us open
166946 ik vind het vooral grof dat ze me een gebrek aan motivatie verwijten en aanhalen dat ik maar twee van mijn zeven kansen greep om op een grand slam te dubbelen met olivier blijkbaar kent het boic de reglementen dus niet in 2007 stond ik nog zo laag gerangschikt dat ik bij drie van die zeven grand slams niet eens mocht deelnemen zelfs niet met federer als partner
166947 je moet top 24 zijn om naar de spelen te mogen van het boic
166948 maar een olympisch toernooi wordt gespeeld door 68 spelers met andere woorden mocht elk land selecteren zoals het boic dan was er geen tennistoernooi op de spelen
166949 of dit onze selectieprocedure ondermijnt daar willen we nu geen uitspraken over doen we concentreren ons op de belgische delegatie in peking die nu uit 96 atleten bestaat
166950 ik zie niet in waarom sporters die met hetzelfde probleem zitten nu geen juridische stappen zouden ondernemen tenzij het hen echt niet interesseert
166951 dit raakt aan de essentie van ons functioneren wie mag selecteren de nationale olympische comit s of de internationale bonden wij leggen in het olympisch charter de macht bij de nocs maar ik begrijp de bonden ook
166952 ik hou me niet bezig met de uitspraak maar met de gevolgen ervan
166953 er is geen logement voorzien voor hen en bovendien is de inschrijvingsdatum verstreken dat proberen we nu zo snel mogelijk in orde te brengen ook hun visum en vlucht probeer ik zo snel mogelijk te regelen ik doe al het mogelijke ze hebben daar recht op

167000 if your institutions are running reasonably efficiently if you cut funding youre going to cut quality or quantity
167001 you could certainly cut the costs but you could destroy quality
167002 does the state make the decision that were going to let all of society pay for it because all of society benefits
167003 i think in terms of return on investment and overall economic prosperity investment in higher education really deserves a higher priority setting for state spending and public policy
167004 if its just about being relatively free and easy with money for higher education when you have it with very little demands and then cutting the budget when you have to and replacing it with tuition which is kind of what has been with public policy in a lot of states for the last 40 or 50 years that isnt going to get us there
167005 the best way to get steep increases in a hurry as some states have done is to deregulate it or to be entirely deferential to the colleges and universities
167006 there is no danger to public safety and local fire department and base emergency officials responded quickly and professionally

167010 seit 1991 sind in der deutschen industrie vier millionen arbeitspl tze verloren gegangen und zugleich mehr als f nf millionen zus tzliche arbeitspl tze im dienstleistungssektor entstanden sicher zwischen 2005 und 2007 sind in der industrie erstmals seit langem wieder zus tzliche arbeitspl tze geschaffen worden und zwar rund 75 000 doch in den dienstleistungsbranchen waren es im gleichen zeitraum 946 000 zus tzliche jobs der anteil des industriellen sektors an der gesamtwirtschaftlichen besch ftigung ist damit weiter geschrumpft

167019 respectful campaign is on the attack comparing obama to paris hilton and britney spears and making false claims about his energy plan
167020 this is george bush shaking hands with john mccain promising not to run a negative campaign the narrator of one mccain campaign ad in south carolina in 2000 stated
167021 do we really want another politician in the white house america cant trust
167022 reject this character assassination reject the low road to the presidency
167023 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me obama tells a campaign audience
167024 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
167025 he is claiming that what were doing somehow has racial overtones says mccain campaign manager rick davis
167026 to be honest i dont know how else you explain the quote about the dollar bills other than to believe that somehow barack obama was calling something we had done racist
167027 given the seriousness of these issues obama writes in his fundraising email

167041 as prerrogativas dos advogados t m de ser respeitadas como parte do estado de direito mas sem que isso interfira na luta do pa s contra a impunidade
167042 nos causou estranheza que um grupo de magistrados e membros do minist rio p blico tenha divulgado a todos essa mentira deslavada a de que os escrit rios passariam a ser dep sitos para o crime escondendo armas provas e documentos ilegais dos clientes
167043 eventuais abusos podem ser coibidos e n o se verifica razo vel deva a advocacia contar com aparato legislativo de aplica o exclusiva a seus pares em detrimento de todos os demais profissionais que devam resguardar o sigilo profissional e mediante afronta ao princ pio da igualdade

167045 a lei da anistia refere se apenas a crimes n o a demandas de natureza civil
167046 ser que quem seq estrou o embaixador norte americano e o prendeu dizendo todo dia que ia mat lo n o cometeu ato de tortura da mesma forma igualmente conden vel
167047 se for para julgar quem torturou vamos julgar todos inclusive muitos que est o na c pula do governo hoje e tem at ministro de estado
167048 existe uma lei de anistia e a nica forma de se punir os militares que praticaram estes atos de tortura que considero reprov veis anular a lei porque o outro lado tamb m cometeu atos hediondos em diversas ocasi es que precisam ser julgados da mesma forma
167049 lamber as feridas que procurem as suas tamb m entre os que assaltaram e mataram inocentes seq estraram embaixadores e outros diplomatas e praticaram atos de terrorismo matando civis
167050 o m rito da demanda procedente e h que se frisar o reconhecimento de um dever de pagamento por parte dos requeridos j que descumpriram ordem judicial pelo per odo de cinco dias e se mostraram despreocupados com as ordens judiciais

167054 a partir do momento em que o agente do estado pega o prisioneiro e o tortura num por o ele sai da legalidade do pr prio regime militar e se torna um criminoso comum n o foi um ato pol tico ele violou a ordem jur dica da pr pria ditadura e tem de ser responsabilizado
167055 n o foi um ponto de chegada mas um ponto de partida do processo de reconcilia o nacional

167057 uma an lise que deve ser balizada na vis o universal da responsabiliza o do agente que extravasa o mandato que o estado lhe confere e comete tortura
167058 esse agente que entrou em uma casa noite cumprindo um mandado superior que realizou uma pris o ilegal mas a realizou dentro das normas do regime autorit rio e levou o prisioneiro para um local de interrogat rio at esse momento estava de acordo com o regime vigente e por esse ato n o pode ser responsabilizado
167059 mas a partir do momento em que esse agente pega o prisioneiro leva para um por o e o tortura ele saiu da pr pria legalidade do regime militar
167060 mesmo no per odo da ditadura o c digo penal continuou existindo e os compromissos internacionais que o brasil havia assumido no p s guerra continuaram vigorando
167061 s autores de crimes pol ticos s o anisti veis eles s o os que resistiram opress o e ditadura
167062 o programa de anistia est distorcido pelos valores elevados dados aos anistiados e porque beneficia muitas vezes pessoas que ficaram encarceradas por horas
167063 sou violentamente contra a tortura mas do ponto de vista constitucional n o vejo como a lei possa ser revista entendo que a anistia foi absoluta para os dois lados n o vejo como reabrir essa p gina embora seja uma p gina triste do passado brasileiro
167064 a partir do momento em que esse agente pega esse prisioneiro e leva ele para o por o e o tortura ele saiu da pr pria legalidade do regime militar portanto seu delito n o um delito pol tico um delito de tortura ele passou a ser um torturador igual a qualquer outro torturador que a humanidade reconhece

167072 seguran a n o problema da justi a eleitoral o estado tem que garantir que os cidad os possam ir e vir entrar nos lugares onde for

167102 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
167103 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
167104 i think republican candidate john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
167105 my legs are steel springs and every day i get out of bed and i beat my chest

167108 im looking forward to challenging malignaggi for his title las vegas is a second home for me
167109 the fans treat me like gold i promise them another value for money fight
167110 as a fan i am excited to see if hatton can lure malignaggi into a brawl or if malignaggi can dictate the tempo and make the fight his
167111 i have seen a consultant in cardiff who advised me to rest it for three weeks
167112 i now expect the fight to take place in november
167113 i have been informed by my people at square ring that the fight will most likely be rescheduled for november 8 on hbo pay per view at madison square garden
167114 i am glad we are close to being able to put together a new date for the fight within 24 hours of learning of joes injury
167115 joe had shown some concern recently about his hand not being ready
167116 i still wanted to move forward with the september date since american television network hbo had already laid out the red carpet for a pay per view success when we took the de la hoya mayweather date
167117 but i dont want him to be any less than his best so if this is what it takes for that then so be it
167118 i had originally proposed something kind of different for this fight
167119 that is that joe and i would first weigh in for the fight at 168lbs and fight for joes super middleweight titles
167120 then we would step off the scales drink some water and weigh in again at more than 168 so that we could also fight for joes ring magazine light heavyweight title
167121 i only recall this happening once before in the leonard lalonde fight in 1988 and i think it would really add something unique to the promotion
167122 joe initially expressed concern about his ability to make 168 by september 19 but now that we have another seven weeks i hope that he will go for it and that the wba wbo and the wbc will sanction it

167128 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
167129 as hedging unwinds within the industry airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to we are not reflecting the spot price of oil today what is reflected in our fares is the oil price net of hedging
167130 we are honest and realistic about this in a way that a lot of airlines are not we have asked ourselves the question of what does the industry look like at 150 per barrel and what do we do to be one of the airlines that succeeds in that environment we dont just want to hang in there

167132 moving to impose download limits on customers of independent internet providers an act the smaller firms say is designed to eliminate broadband competition and prevent the introduction of new television services
167133 the montreal based company which cut its own sympatico customers off from unlimited downloading last year has proposed extending that plan to firms renting portions of its network in order to provide their own services
167134 that would include a number of smaller wholesale isp customers such as chatham ont based teksavvy solutions inc cobourg ont based eagle ca mississauga based acanac inc and ottawa based national capital freenet
167135 while bell canada launched a frontal assault on the wholesale competition by forcibly throttling customers its now opened two new assault lines aimed at back dooring wholesale business models and opening another anti competitive fight that could see all wholesalers customers not only throttled but limited to only 2 gigs to 60 gigs per month
167136 usage based billing ubb is not a carrier class method of doing business
167137 carriers buy capacity on networks and they utilize that capacity in a manner that allows for the efficient delivery of products and services says copeland going on the wholesale vendor of such a facility shouldnt interfere with the delivery of the product or service nor should they apply what amounts to a surcharge when an end user decides to make use of the product or service
167138 bell is like a detoit auto company which lures in customers with basic cars but generates its biggest profit margins by bait n switching buyers to more expensive models
167139 taken several steps toward eliminating the smaller isps ability to compete over the past few months the firms say
167140 bell began slowing the speeds of its own sympatico subscribers using peer to peer applications such as bittorrent last november then extended the practice to its wholesale customers in march prompting a dispute that is before the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission
167141 the smaller companies through the canadian association of internet providers say bell is breaking telecommunications law through its speed
167142 bell says its hand was forced in introducing the throttling and download limits because of growing internet usage and abuse of peer to peer networks by a small percentage of customers

167154 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
167155 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
167156 too early to say what impact it will have on the business in terms of jobs
167157 this is the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced and fares are likely to go up as we reduce some winter capacity and cope with unprecedented oil prices but we wont be grounding any aircraft
167158 the good cash position reduction in net debt and 7 per cent increase in yields were bright spots so that is probably driving the price
167159 how far out should i put my signs in the ground
167160 for many days and im not taking it anymore have you ever thought for once for once how i felt instead of your pleasures
167161 for many months i had to deal with you doing things that i thought you would never do you even cheated on me a month ago was what broke the straw but i forgave you i was a fool to forgive you i was a bigger fool to think you was my life
167162 but what ricardo you never asked for my opinion now youre forced to hear what i have to say now do you even love me huh isnt that what you always ask me when you want me to do things to you that i never thought of thinking huh if you dont do this with me you dont love me ring any bells
167163 so it is true the previous girlfriends you left just because they didnt follow your demands what they told me were the truth you only used me for your self consciousness
167164 i cant take this anymore im sorry ricardo but instead of you leaving me im leaving you im not going to take this anymore i need to breathe again and not worry if anyone else would get mad for what im doing
167165 i thought i could trust you but i hate that i love you but i give up
167166 uhm yea i guess better than i did three days ago
167167 wow i were vampires this is insane i always knew there was something weird about the cullens though
167168 yup uhm you should go meet alice in the hall youre room is right next to hers
167169 hey bella wow im psyched to have a new sister
167170 oh rosalies just jealous that shes not the prettiest anymore
167171 well go shopping after you go on your first hunt
167172 cuba has expressed interest in buying more jets of russia the negotiations are underway
167173 i have seen a consultant in cardiff who advised me to rest it for three weeks
167174 i now expect the fight to take place in november
167175 i have been informed by my people at square ring that the fight will most likely be rescheduled for november 8 on hbo pay per view at madison square garden
167176 i am glad we are close to being able to put together a new date for the fight within 24 hours of learning of joes injury
167177 joe had shown some concern recently about his hand not being ready
167178 i still wanted to move forward with the september date since american television network hbo had already laid out the red carpet for a pay per view success when we took the de la hoya mayweather date
167179 but i dont want him to be any less than his best so if this is what it takes for that then so be it
167180 i had originally proposed something kind of different for this fight
167181 that is that joe and i would first weigh in for the fight at 168lbs and fight for joes super middleweight titles
167182 then we would step off the scales drink some water and weigh in again at more than 168 so that we could also fight for joes ring magazine light heavyweight title
167183 i only recall this happening once before in the leonard lalonde fight in 1988 and i think it would really add something unique to the promotion
167184 joe initially expressed concern about his ability to make 168 by september 19 but now that we have another seven weeks i hope that he will go for it and that the wba wbo and the wbc will sanction it
167185 im looking forward to challenging malignaggi for his title las vegas is a second home for me
167186 the fans treat me like gold i promise them another value for money fight
167187 as a fan i am excited to see if hatton can lure malignaggi into a brawl or if malignaggi can dictate the tempo and make the fight his

167215 hes visited by ghosts of the dead hes possessed by them manifestations of people killed in the conflicts during that time
167216 in afghanistan they have adapted it to their own circumstances they have taleban members ordinary citizens russian soldiers all represented by ghosts in the play
167217 there were various conversations by e mail about how it would be adapted and if it would be useful
167218 i signed the rights to a production for afghanistan and theyve done it in dari and pashtu two of the biggest language groups in afghanistan and theyre running it all over
167219 but when is the right time for this when like in afghanistan the conflict is still ongoing
167220 if they were to wait for the conflict to be over they would be waiting a long time
167221 it could be argued a bit like the irish conflict that war and a peace process often go hand in hand

167234 i think the long term secular direction still favours energy and materials and not the financials
167235 i think the banks will plod along just fine and generate slow earnings growth slow dividend growth but i think i have better opportunities elsewhere because the banks are in a mature market and they certainly wont be taking on excess risk because we know what that came to and so their opportunities to grow are very limited

167306 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
167307 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
167308 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

167312 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
167313 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
167314 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint

167339 in the twenty20 format anything can happen but i think ireland and scotland are the two favourite sides because they are playing in familiar conditions while we are coming from hot conditions

167342 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
167343 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
167344 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
167345 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
167346 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
167347 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
167348 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
167349 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
167350 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
167351 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
167352 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

167413 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
167414 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
167415 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
167416 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
167417 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
167418 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
167419 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
167420 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
167421 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
167422 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
167423 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
167424 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
167425 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
167426 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
167427 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
167428 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
167429 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
167430 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
167431 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
167432 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
167433 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
167434 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
167435 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
167436 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
167437 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
167438 gumgum reduces our photo licensing costs while still allowing us to publish high quality photographs from a variety of photo agencies

167440 the farmer in the dell the farmer in the dell heigh ho the derry oh the farmer in the dell
167441 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
167442 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
167443 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
167444 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
167445 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
167446 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
167447 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
167448 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
167449 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
167450 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
167451 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
167452 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
167453 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
167454 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
167455 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
167456 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
167457 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
167458 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
167459 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
167460 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
167461 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
167462 who are open to doing something on the production side
167463 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
167464 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
167465 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
167466 were fortunate to be in the position to give back to a place that has done so much for us
167467 one out of 100 kids has some kind of heart defect
167468 he is all boy he gets into everything we are incredibly grateful
167469 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
167470 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
167471 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
167472 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
167473 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
167474 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
167475 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
167476 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
167477 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
167478 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
167479 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
167480 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
167481 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
167482 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
167483 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
167484 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
167485 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
167486 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
167487 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
167488 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
167489 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
167490 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
167491 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
167492 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
167493 policy coherence for availability of medicines for emerging and neglected infectious diseases

167498 we are excited about joining the double take software team and contributing to the development of tools that allow our customers to liberate workloads and reduce hardware and power consumption as they move to a more dynamically managed infrastructure
167499 virtualization has evolved and is now much more than just a tool for server consolidation
167500 i am thrilled to have been selected to discuss how virtualization enables emerging technology companies to develop new methods for it organizations to tackle existing problems
167501 electronic alliance industries eia rail enabling tool less cable management to be mounted on the rack low profile casters that make the cabinet 2
167502 the comprehensiveness of our solution has always drawn customers to us and we saw the management burden their increasingly virtualized infrastructures were creating for them

167510 liquid biofuels can provide a much needed substitute to fossile fuels
167511 simple ban on biofuel production or the immediate revocation of existing mandates for biofuel use is too blunt an instrument and will almost certainly do more harm than good

167545 what are you talking about food can never be too important
167546 we did this after the arabs started this week to build an illegal structure on the spot this is after the municipality has already demolished a structure on this property once before
167547 in the jewish neighborhoods illegal construction typically takes the form of additions to existing legal structures such as closing a balcony or hollowing out under a building to create an extra room in the arab sector however illegal construction often takes the form of entire multi floor buildings with four to 25 living units built with the financial assistance of the palestinian authority on land that is not owned by the builder
167548 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
167549 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
167550 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
167551 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
167552 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
167553 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability
167554 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
167555 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
167556 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned
167557 makes clear as did the original order that all statutes have to be complied with when the intelligence community is undertaking activities governed by specific statutes
167558 rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
167559 if thats still the position of the department of justice then this entire exercise is meaningless
167560 this all could be voided by presidential fiat without even amending whats written now
167561 if the intelligence community is acting to further the interest of at amp t
167562 then maybe we better understand why at amp t cooperated in the warrantless wiretapping program
167563 hes got a lot of charisma and a lot of credibility and were very happy that hes going to lend his voice to some of the other great freedom advocates that will be there with us that day
167564 big draw he supports our views hes against this war hes for civil liberties
167565 this government has reached an end national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
167566 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
167567 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
167568 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
167569 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
167570 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
167571 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
167572 this gives much respect to the masters that preceed them blues aficionados should have no problem allowing the mighty flyers to carry blues into the 21st century
167573 piazzas singing has the power to lend intimacy and credibility to the otherwise trite words of boogie and jump tunes ballads and shuffles his harp playing is always accomplished
167574 the blues remains the heart and soul of their still instantly recognizable sound
167575 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
167576 the risk of a few quarters of declining gdp gross domestic product continue to rise
167577 for some corporates it is a triple cocktail higher commodity costs higher interest costs and reduced demand from consumers its more than some can cope with
167578 we do see an uncertain economic outlook a difficult mortgage market and the potential for house price fall

167806 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
167807 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
167808 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
167809 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
167810 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
167811 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
167812 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
167813 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it

167816 im very pleased with how well the obama people are getting their people out
167817 i have stood on stage with him in 22 debates but whos counting i have seen his passion and determination his grace and his grit his own life exemplifies the american dream
167818 but now it is time for us to unite and together to stand up and say no more of the republican ideology
167819 i respect his many accomplishments my differences with him are not personal
167820 they are with the policies he has proposed because while he legitimately can tout moments of independence from his party in the past such independence isnt characteristic of his presidential campaign
167821 so she can partially forgive me for not supporting her losing candidate
167822 all of us are on the same team again everyone has worked hard on the clinton event

167824 im looking at a case of books with a large sticker that says do not open until saturday
167825 this is the closest thing to harry potter that weve seen
167826 for the first time since harry potter i see kids and teens getting excited about a book series
167827 these are books that demonstrate how to be in a responsible relationship when youre a teenager it shows how people care about each other on different levels
167828 theyre clean cut books and theres nothing in there parents wouldnt want their child reading
167829 you could describe our current food safety system as outbreak roulette
167830 the industry is realizing based on this outbreak that we need to have the ability to trace back so that we can segregate where the problem is and not devastate the entire industry
167831 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all of the agencys legal requirements
167832 under this agreement safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods as applied elsewhere in the world
167833 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
167834 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards
167835 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
167836 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations

167838 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
167839 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
167840 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
167841 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
167842 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law

167862 when you first saw my naked body in front of you what was going through your mind
167863 all i wanted to do was to f k your brains out and suck your t ts dry
167864 all that is required is the understanding of the media and every nigerian
167865 as far as this administration is concerned we cannot abandon dialogue on any of the issues that need dialogue nonetheless a summit on the niger delta that we know will move us forward
167866 it is unfortunate that the picture being painted about this state most times does not reflect the truth about us there are certain people just bent on presenting this state in a very bad light but you have seen for yourselves that this is the oasis of peace in the niger delta bayelsa is one of the most peaceful states if not the most peaceful in the country we record the least crime rate in bayelsa but it is exaggerated beyond belief we are gradually getting used to that now but we are certain people will gradually begin to come and they will see what is exactly on ground that is why we encourage this kind of event that will bring people into the state to see that we are not in a war zone at all
167867 this training initiative underscores our unchanging commitment to keep faith with a timely realisation of the 4th and 5th millennium development goals mdgs respectively especially as they relate to reduction in maternal and child mortality rates by the year 2015
167868 i think if we can master these skills it will go a long way to stop these unnecessary deaths within days weeks and months especially in nigeria and africa the professionals being trained today doctors nurses and midwives can actually go back to their various hospitals and introduce emergency skills drills they can actually go and change practice utilise the skills acquired now and say to other colleagues this is how we should do it now
167869 this is the first one today but yesterday we got two dead bodies we now have a total of five dead while two are alive
167870 i cant explain how it happened but god just helped me
167871 i am looking for my brother now let government help us with information by checking numbers of the people that are dead or alive and the hospital they were taken to

167881 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
167882 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
167883 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
167884 i would rather be in our dressing room than theirs at the moment if we can build a first innings lead of 100 plus then we will be in a strong position
167885 if we continue with democracy for another eight years the people by then will be more enlightened such that they will not regard boreholes as the responsibilities of legislators
167886 today mccain unveiled a new ad in eleven states flashing images of britney spears and paris hilton suggesting obama is just another vapid celebrity
167887 and today mccain comparing obama to empty celebrities all sizzle no substance john mccain has been trying to raise doubts about his opponent today in colorado he was at it again
167888 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
167889 mccain has recently said obama would rather lose a war to win an election hes called him dr no on energy reforms and run ads blaming obama for high gas prices
167890 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

167928 entrepreneur of the year trademark is invalid and unenforceable because the phrase is generic
167929 they call theirs ernst amp young entrepreneur of the year we call ours entrepreneur magazine entrepreneur of the year there are dozens of entrepreneur of the year contests around the country

167935 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
167936 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
167937 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favor to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
167938 we have nothing to say fifa is not going to intervene let it be as it is now
167939 its a period movie set in victorian england so were very specific about the look we need
167940 in an ideal world out of the 125 women we need they would all have long naturally coloured hair
167941 wed love men with beards or facial hair lamb chops or big sideburns that sort of thing
167942 most of the people chosen would be required for almost the full two week duration so we need people who have some flexibility in their work or time to allow that to happen

167959 the university and the commerce school benefit every day from marias dedication and commitment to her work
167960 the engineering school is in an excellent position to help promote education in stem fields among all k 12 students in our region especially underrepresented minority students
167961 during our recent camp you could see the proverbial light bulbs go off when these students were able to have fun with hands on scientific experiences
167962 this camp allows kids the opportunity to apply systems engineering in creative and exciting ways whether they were programming robots to collaborate in creating colorful artwork or to compete in robotic soccer matches
167963 in terms of introducing these concepts to young people or adults for that matter nothing beats having the kids apply the concepts through open ended hands on projects
167964 the brains development is very complicated and were really just starting to understand how it works
167965 its still one of the big mysteries of science how is the brain built how does its structure mediate thoughts decisions and actions
167966 the connections between the thalamus and the cortex mediate all of your conscious perceptions and actions so your thoughts would be disconnected from your body if you didnt have these connections
167967 we dont know for sure but there is some evidence to suggest that there are problems with these connections in people with epilepsy mental retardation and possibly schizophrenia perhaps related to defects in the way that the layer structure of the brain forms and in general brain growth
167968 were really looking at these issues on multiple levels both within the department of cell biology and other departments we are trying to understand how changes in the structures of individual cells can cause changes in the shapes of whole tissues or whole organisms whether during development in a disease state or during evolution
167969 that is our goal and sometimes it gets taken in a weird direction
167970 like youre failing if youre not releasing an expansion each year its probably going to be a long time before we get to the point where we are releasing an expansion each year
167971 our goal is to make an awesome experience and obviously we felt that lich king needed more time to get to where it needed to go

167978 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
167979 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
167980 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
167981 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
167982 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
167983 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
167984 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
167985 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
167986 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
167987 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
167988 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
167989 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
167990 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
167991 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
167992 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
167993 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
167994 i think we always look to make the game we want to make and then figure out the kind of financial model that works with that game

168003 football is such a major part of liverpools culture and the citys passion for the game is famous all over the world
168004 the project is about the people for the people and the unconditional love they have for their team it shows how football can help bring people together during hard times and great times and how fans on merseyside and beyond all have something in common regardless of where their loyalties lie
168005 i have photographed people of different ages races gender and nationalities from the blue and red halves of the city the one thing which ties them all together is the fact that they are all true football fans who support their team to the end
168006 the items we have selected for display will help place tabitha jussas photographs in context it will show the history of both everton and liverpool supporters and how going to the match has changed over the years
168007 were looking forward to putting a taster of the collection on show for fans to see in advance of next years main exhibition
168008 the 12th man is yet another fantastic exhibition at central library during our capital of culture year the photographic display along with a sneak preview of the everton collection is a real treat for football fans
168009 tabithas work has placed her at the heart of the citys footballing culture to allow her to create a fascinating and visually stunning exhibition im delighted that the whole city will now be able to see this unique take on the diverse passionate and colourful supporters who help make everton and liverpool two of the greatest football clubs in the world
168010 this hottie is from usa she is 6 tall and has some big firm 34ddds
168011 we believe that politicising the olympics does not favour resolving these issues and also violates the olympic spirit
168012 the current dream of the chinese people is to accelerate building a modern country realise the great renaissance of the chinese nation and with the peoples of the world seek peaceful progress amicable co existence and harmonious development
168013 we must see that currently there are uncertain and unstable factors in the international environment and chinas domestic economy faces increasing challenges and hardships
168014 we must maintain steady relatively fast development and control excessive price rises as the priority tasks of macro adjustment
168015 but i want to tell you that as the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalised it seems my hope is unlikely to be realised
168016 at the same time as constantly deepening reform of the economic system and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue pursuing comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
168017 continue expanding socialist democracy and developing a state of socialist rule of law
168018 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
168019 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
168020 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
168021 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
168022 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
168023 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
168024 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned

168034 its such a pleasure to travel i go to new york at least two or three times a year im particularly fond of marrakech last year we spent christmas in dubai people tell us that oman is extremely beautiful im also attracted by the idea of colombia but more and more im coming to believe that the journey into my own self is the journey that i like the best
168035 he was the only person with whom i could have a one to one conversation on what i call the sacramental aspect of walking he and i share a belief that walking is not simply therapeutic for oneself but is a poetic activity that can cure the world of its ills he sums up his position in a stern pronouncement walking is a virtue tourism deadly sin
168036 for what is the point of training but making pain seem routine you work the body yes but the real point of training is to accustom the mind to endure discomfort to know it tolerate it and even finally to like it

168058 all officials in any sport i know were upset by that the integrity issue were all about integrity its the most important thing we have to maintain because people have to trust that youre calling a fair game sort of clouded us all
168059 now i cant comment on other sports but i can tell you in the nfl that i just cant imagine that sort of thing happening not just because of the integrity but because of the scrutiny we are under
168060 instant replay the fact that you can fix mistakes through instant replay is big because if there is somebody that was doing that you have the opportunity to fix it the grading system that weve got because we have one game a week the league is able to grade with a tremendous amount of scrutiny the officials on every play and if an official was making mistakes hed be fired we have officials who are let go every year because of grades and so that is another significant check on that sort of thing

168093 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
168094 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
168095 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
168096 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
168097 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
168098 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
168099 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
168100 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
168101 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
168102 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
168103 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
168104 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
168105 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
168106 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
168107 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
168108 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
168109 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
168110 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
168111 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
168112 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
168113 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
168114 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
168115 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
168116 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
168117 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
168118 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
168119 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
168120 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
168121 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
168122 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
168123 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
168124 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
168125 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
168126 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
168127 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
168128 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
168129 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
168130 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
168131 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
168132 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
168133 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
168134 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
168135 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
168136 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
168137 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
168138 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
168139 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
168140 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
168141 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
168142 dozens of bullas from the period already have been found some of which turned out to be fakes
168143 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
168144 the file wmploc dll has a version number of 11 0 6000 6336 where 11 0 6000 6344 was expected windows media player is not installed properly and must be reinstalled do you want to install the player from the microsoft web site yes or no
168145 there is a more recent version of windows media player 11 0 6000 6336 already installed on your computer it is not possible to use an older installation package 11 0 5721 5146 to install files or to repair your current version of the player
168146 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry
168147 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
168148 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
168149 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
168150 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
168151 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
168152 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
168153 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
168154 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
168155 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
168156 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
168157 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
168158 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
168159 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
168160 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
168161 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
168162 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
168163 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
168164 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
168165 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
168166 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
168167 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
168168 given the extraordinary circumstances it is my hope that you will allow us some additional time to prepare the necessary pleadings
168169 the public interest requires that this matter be resolved fairly but without undue delay
168170 it shows that the governor is serious and ready to go and not buying into this constant delay delay delay which has been the case with the kilpatrick administration from the very beginning of the charges
168171 this incredible milestone is truly a testament to our customer loyalty and adoption and we look forward to celebrating this landmark transaction with our two lucky fans
168172 accomplishing our 15 millionth ticket sale only seven months since the 10 millionth shows how more fans continue to adopt stubhub and reward us for our superior customer experience
168173 much to my delight stubhub proved to be a faster more reliable means to obtain tickets
168174 stubhub has made managing my seasons my time and my cost much easier
168175 the chinese government wont allow the spread of any information that is forbidden by law or harms national interests on the internet
168176 if a few web sites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
168177 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries
168178 there has been little progress towards fulfilling the chinese authorities promise to improve human rights but rather continued deterioration in key areas
168179 the organization also condemns the cynicism of the chinese authorities who have yet again lied
168180 and the iocs inability to prevent this situation because of its refusal to speak out for several years
168181 to try her on the eve of the games is an extraordinary insult to those who lost their homes to the beijing olympics and shows contempt for human rights concerns raised by the international community
168182 in our analysis from the information available greenpeace found that beijing achieved and in some cases surpassed original environmental goals
168183 also missed some opportunities that could have ensured a better short and long term environmental olympic legacy for the city

168190 she enjoyed athletics but when she got to 18 she didnt want to do it anymore im not sure why
168191 she used to love going to livingstones at the weekend she made a lot of friends and she was very popular
168192 kelly just wanted to be a regular girl she had her low moments at times she wasnt happy that she had to take anti rejection drugs every day
168193 she had a blood test which showed she had suffered a heart attack
168194 she was gravely sick she was icy cold and her lips were blue
168195 she was placed on a life support machine and she battled and battled but she passed away on monday evening
168196 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it

168199 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
168200 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
168201 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
168202 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
168203 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
168204 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
168205 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling

168212 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
168213 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
168214 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
168215 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
168216 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters

168222 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
168223 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver

168274 im coming to china as the president and as a friend
168275 i know its best for the u s china relationship that i go
168276 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the u s side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to the anti china hostile forces
168277 the chinese government very much appreciates president bushs support for the beijing olympics but they cannot abandon the chinese position on other matters
168278 the matter of dissidents is quite sensitive and the foreign ministry always makes strong protestations when dealing with this kind of affair
168279 an atmosphere that honours the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
168280 the resolution exposed the malicious intention of a handful of anti china lawmakers to politicize interrupt and sabotage the games
168281 presents the chinese with an opportunity to demonstrate compassion on human rights and freedom

168290 we are not taking jesus to brazil hes already there
168291 there is a lot of confusion about the first determination made by the zoning administrator and when i came on board i reviewed it and it is totally incorrect ok he grandfathered in 240 spaces plus or minus without excluding those areas he was supposed to exclude i indicated i would take that issue under review and reach some sort of revised number
168292 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case
168293 he wont hurt no one else in the world like he did those two women
168294 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
168295 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
168296 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
168297 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
168298 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
168299 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
168300 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
168301 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
168302 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue
168303 theyre still on alert because we have another big wind event coming in tomorrow
168304 the fire has burned to the point now where people can see the flames

168306 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
168307 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
168308 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
168309 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain

168333 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible

168336 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
168337 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
168338 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
168339 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
168340 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual
168341 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
168342 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
168343 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
168344 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
168345 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
168346 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
168347 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

168350 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
168351 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
168352 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
168353 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
168354 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
168355 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
168356 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
168357 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
168358 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
168359 they fight like other couples but they love each other and their little boy
168360 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault

168426 in an unexpected twist of events nullriver has officially released netshare an apple approved iphone tethering application onto the app store
168427 the purpose of the application is to share an iphones internet connection with other devices over wi fi essentially making the iphone into an on the go wi fi hotspot
168428 were not quite sure why apple took down the application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far
168429 netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements
168430 were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time well do our best to try to get the application back onto the appstore if at all possible at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering

168461 the current architecture in the security model around google gadgets is highly insecure
168462 information can take minutes or even hours to fade out on a computer
168463 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
168464 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
168465 if you start from almost zero its easy to triple
168466 two things have to happen people have to begin deploying vista in a broad way and have to believe that all of their applications are fully compatible with a 64 bit environment
168467 its nice to see 64 bit use tracking this way
168468 but im not going home to the wife and saying its finally the time i have to go out and buy a 64 bit windows pc i just dont think people are excited by this kind of thing the way they used to be
168469 64 bit has some definite benefits but its about what kind of workloads you are pushing through your pc
168470 performance may still vary depending on your graphics card and game requirements

168472 that doesnt mean those 2 million all went to the iphone
168473 competition in enterprise smartphones is going to be between blackberry and windows mobile
168474 clearly weve moved to a point in time where our customers have to be much more focused on protecting the information itself as opposed to protecting the pc or protecting the network
168475 while those are necessary components of a protection strategy theyre not the end all more has to be done
168476 good data loss policies start with the understanding of what is the critical data that i have and where is it
168477 in many instances there is some critical and sensitive information on every laptop but not all information thats on that laptop is critical and sensitive
168478 if you think cryptography is the solution to this problem you dont understand the problem and you dont understand cryptography
168479 youve got to look at what value you place on the information
168480 nobody wants to pay 500 to protect a 50 asset
168481 theyve had to learn the hard way you cant solve technology problems with policies and you can solve policy problems with technology
168482 originally the plan was to ship by the end of may
168483 we expect our business to turn weaker as we exit the third quarter
168484 our strategy with javafx is that were providing the presentation layer for java
168485 in the enterprise you will start getting the ability to take existing applications add a rich client interface and then have the ability to deploy it on the web or the desktop
168486 many java developers have been using adobes flex of late
168487 that said the java community is very patient with stuff like this once javafx and related tools are in general release thatll be the test of the desire for the overall java community i dont think you can write it off just yet
168488 but the feeling i get is that its still early development shops havent committed to a single platform at this point so from that standpoint its not too late

168535 it is natural and right that regulators should seek to learn lessons the credit crisis will damage not just the reputation of the financial system but also the lives of those who lose their houses businesses and jobs as a result of it but before governments set about reforming financial regulation they need both to be clear about the causes of the crisis and to understand just how little regulators can achieve the view that the only sensible response to the 21st centurys first serious financial crisis is a wholesale reform of the system is now gaining ground but there are two reasons to hesitate before plunging headlong into a purge of the system first finance was not solely to blame for the crisis lax monetary policy also played a starring role low interest rates boosted the prices of assets especially of housing which in turn fed into complex debt securities this created a spiral of debt that is only now being unwound true monetary policy is too blunt a tool to manage asset prices with but as the imf now says central banks in economies with deep mortgage markets should in future lean against the wind when house prices are rising fast the second reason to hesitate is that bold re regulation could damage the very economies it is designed to protect at times like this the temptation is for tighter controls to rein in risk takers so that those regular painful crashes could be avoided it is an honourable aim but a mistaken one the notion that the world can just regulate its way out of crises is thus an illusion rather crisis is the price of innovation so governments face a choice they can embrace new financial ideas by keeping markets open regulation will be light but there will be busts the state will sometimes have to clear up and regulation must be about cure as well as prevention or governments can aim for safety and opt for dumbed down financial systems that hobble their economies and deprive their people of the benefits of faster growth and even then a crisis may strike

168546 prime minister manmohan singh has been very forthright in stating that the nuclear deal would in no way constrain new delhis right to resume testing india is not a party to the npt and it is one of the only 14 states that have not signed the ctbt if india decides to test again so be it but the bulwarks of the global non proliferation system should not become complicit in this decision if so the negative consequences of another game changing decision by the bush administration will be greatly compounded the damage arising from this deal can be limited by making it harder for a future indian government to resume nuclear testing

168606 lo hacen convencidas de que no van a querer tener m s hijos con la idea de que es un procedimiento sin vuelta atr s
168607 sin embargo la vida y las circunstancias cambian la situaci n econ mica puede haber mejorado puede aparecer una nueva pareja haber fallecido un hijo el propio proyecto de vida puede haber dado un giro y la mujer siente deseos de ser madre de nuevo los estudios nos dicen que entre un 10 y un 15 de las mujeres que se han sometido a ligadura de trompas desean tener un hijo en alg n momento seg n las estad sticas la mayor a de las que finalmente deciden intentarlo optan por la reproducci n asistida pocas saben que la ligadura de trompas puede ser reversible y que de hecho la intervenci n de reversi n lo que en ginecolog a se conoce como repermeabilizaci n tub rica consigue m s embarazos que la reproducci n asistida
168608 a medida que la mujer cumple a os la fertilidad se reduce
168609 por eso en mujeres menores de 35 a os conseguimos tasas de xitos es decir de embarazos del 70 y hasta del 85 cuando la mujer cumple los 40 a os el porcentaje desciende y es de entre el 50 y el 60 la media general de xitos en nuestra cl nica es del 60 la raz n es porque la mayor a de las pacientes que acuden a nosotros para someterse a reversi n de ligadura de trompas superan los 35 a os nuestro punto de corte son los 45 a os por encima de los 50 no realizamos la intervenci n
168610 las opciones para esas pacientes son la adopci n o las t cnicas de reproducci n asistida
168611 yo no sab a que al hacerme la ligadura el m dico me hab a extirpado las trompas cuando me enter y fui a hablar con l me dijo que era la forma de evitar totalmente la posibilidad de un embarazo no quer a que yo llegara un d a embarazada acus ndole de un error m dico afortunadamente y tras varios intentos la reproducci n asistida fue un xito en mi caso hoy mi hija ya tiene dos a os
168612 para que la intervenci n de reversi n ofrezca garant as de xito las trompas no deben estar da adas y tienen que haber conservado la suficiente longitud de al menos cuatro cent metros
168613 adem s y sobre todo deben conservar la parte llamada distal la m s pr xima al ovario
168614 esa porci n es esencial para conseguir un embarazo porque contiene las fimbrias ramificaciones en forma de dedos cuya misi n es capturar los ovocitos tras la ovulaci n y llevarlos desde el ovario a la trompa de hecho si no hay fimbrias no realizamos la intervenci n porque hay muy pocas garant as de que vaya a ser eficaz
168615 en la reversi n la concepci n se produce de forma natural sin limitaci n de ciclos de tratamiento
168616 este riesgo en la mujer sometida a reversi n de ligadura de trompas es un 5 mayor que en el resto no mucho mayor pero lo suficiente para que le aconsejemos un seguimiento muy riguroso en las primeras semanas de embarazo
168617 practicamos una incisi n de unos cuatro cent metros aproximadamente por encima de la l nea del pubis localizamos la zona y extirpamos el trozo de trompa donde se ha realizado la ligadura
168618 buscamos entonces los extremos abiertos y sanos y los volvemos a unir con suturas de microcirug a no visibles al ojo humano finalmente cerramos la incisi n e infiltramos suero en el tero para comprobar si todo funciona correctamente al d a siguiente la paciente ya est en situaci n de volver a su casa
168619 aunque no pod a saber a n con certeza si iba a quedarme embarazada de nuevo la idea de haber recuperado mi capacidad para tener un nuevo hijo de forma natural me produjo una sensaci n fant stica

168682 cargill is using the boom in agrofuels to expand soya palm oil and sugar plantations displacing communities food crops and destroying ecosystems destroying rainforests and other biodiverse ecosystems including healthy soils is one of the quickest ways of heating the planet this is why we are blockading the cargill office two days before the official start of the climate camp at kingsnorth
168683 for companies like cargill agrofuels are an opportunity to make more profits from food to take over more land from small farmers and communities and to further destroy local food production this is why we need an immediate halt to government policies such as the mandatory blending of petrol and diesel with biofuels in the uk as well as an end to free trade food and agricultural policies which solely boost the power and the profits of agribusinesses like cargill instead of agrofuels we need to have policies that support food sovereignty i e which put peoples right to food first and support small scale biodiverse organic farming instead of energy intensive agriculture

168688 o nome da pe a faz refer ncia a uma frase que est no texto quase impercept vel mas tra a o fio condutor do personagem do que ele est buscando
168689 s vendo o espet culo para saber acho que ele busca a felicidade preencher o vazio um espet culo para refletir e n o rir entende ent o cada um pode achar que ele busca uma coisa diferente do que eu penso por exemplo

168693 the justice of this case is that parties to this suit should maintain the status quo so that the res substance will not be destroyed
168694 the res is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants on august 14
168695 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications
168696 this order is not capable of being obeyed because this court cannot sit as an appellate court on the judgment of the international court of justice at the hague
168697 all the issues in this case as well as the final cession of bakassi are fallout from the judgment of the icj
168698 we know that we are bound by the judgment of the icj the presidency did not submit the green tree agreement to the national assembly for ratification while the legislature also failed in its oversight functions to call the president to order
168699 we are challenging the agreement and we are surprised that the president has said he would go ahead to handover in the face of it nigeria has not done what it is supposed to do before implementing the agreement
168700 new bakassi is already inhabited by people other than bakassi people and the inhabitants are hostile to the bakassi refugees

168703 itll be a good time to dress up and have fun
168704 characters seem superficial in a lot of books but those in stephenie meyer books can actually be real teenagers and have some of the same thoughts
168705 this is one of the few books for me in the last five years that kept me up at night
168706 it also brought back memories from when i was younger
168707 we have to draw a clear line of distinction between the pakistan government and rogue intelligence agencies
168708 mccain is trying to make a connection there would you want either of them running the country of course not
168709 he is trying to say hilton and spears are just fluff and so is obama he might be great at waving to cameras but that doesnt mean he knows anything about foreign policy

168712 following a preliminary phase 1 investigation the competition authority has been unable to conclude without further investigation that the transaction will not substantially lessen competition
168713 moby dick proved hard and exhausting to write but he knew it was original and he understood that it was good published in 1851 it was not a success until the first quarter of the twentieth century it was neglected ambitious later books were rejected the failure of moby dick helped turn his primary attention to verse battle pieces 1866 was welcomed as peripheral work by a man who had once been famous for his prose seriously disturbed in his mind he made a trip to the holy land meeting with nathaniel hawthorne in southport en route and out of this visit emerged his most ambitious if not his most accomplished poem the 18 000 line clarel twice as long as paradise lost and in the octo syllabic couplets of gowers confessio amantis eventually melville after working as a minor customs officer in new york was reduced to dependence on his wifes money she gave him an allowance to buy books and to print his later works in small editions for the tiny readership he retained he died in 1891 quite forgotten with the manuscript of the prose work billy budd completed but unpublished his reputation was at such a low ebb that even this masterpiece went unpublished until 1924
168714 the paucity of primary sources derives in large part from the downward trajectory of melvilles career
168715 compare melville to mark twain for instance a man who remained beloved throughout his life and after up to the present
168716 a cosmos a chaos not only perceptibly malignant as the gnostics had intuited but also irrational like the cosmos in the hexameters of lucretius
168717 in general it is the non psychological novel that offers the richest opportunities for psychological elucidation here the author having no intentions of this sort does not show his characters in a psychological light and thus leaves room for analysis and interpretation or even invites it by his unprejudiced mode of presentation i would also include melvilles moby dick which i consider the be the greatest american novel in this broad class of writings
168718 we have little more to say in reprobation or in recommendation of this absurd book
168719 i am like one of those seeds taken out of the egyptian pyramids which after being three thousand years a seed and nothing but a seed being planted in english soil it developed itself grew to greenness and then fell to mould
168720 some critics would place his name among the most important american poets of the nineteenth century or even today
168721 melvilles poems less sumptuous in semantic nuance than the prose less second nature to him than his fiction are worked at and worked up yet the difficulty of the restraining forms remains central so does the rumor of an unspeakable theme unacknowledged at times at times veiled from himself which has to do with a radiant sexual irresolution more insistently even than conrad melville depicts a male world in prose and verse a world in which intimate relationships and erotic experiences are between men and types of men at sea in the army and elsewhere he celebrates laments touches and he occasionally foresees not the huge and benign vision of walt whitman but with narrowed eyes looking further than the future his is not the optimism of emerson but something more serious he sees beyond a bad age he sees to the other side of evil nature consoles but it also remembers and comments
168722 mr herman melville has earned a deservedly high reputation for his performances in descriptive fiction he has gathered his own materials and travelled along fresh and untrodden literary paths exhibiting powers of no common order and great originality the more careful therefore should he be to maintain the fame he so rapidly acquired and not waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales
168723 i could readily see in emerson the insinuation that had he lived in those days when the world was made he might have offered some valuable suggestions
168724 melville as he always does began to reason of providence and futurity and everything that lies beyond human ken and informed me that he had pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated but still he does not seem to rest in that anticipation he can neither believe nor be comfortable in his unbelief and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other
168725 mardi is a rich book with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life it is so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded over it so as to make it a great deal better
168726 readers will note that i have said nothing very much about
168727 it will be a strange sort of book tho i fear blubber is blubber you know and to cook the thing up one must needs throw in a little fancy which from the nature of the things must be ungainly as the gambols of the whales themselves
168728 a sense of unspeakable security is in me at this moment on account of your having understood the book i have written a wicked book and feel spotless as the lamb
168729 fresh from his mountain charged to the muzzle with sailor metaphysics and jargon of things unknowable
168730 he is a little paler and perhaps a little sadder and no doubt has suffered from too constant literary occupation pursued without much success latterly and his writings for a long while past have indicated a morbid state of mind
168731 it is or seems to be a wise sort of thing to realise that all that happens to a man in this life is only by way of a joke and it is also worth bearing in mind that the joke is passed around pretty liberally and impartially so that not very many are entitled to fancy that they in particular are getting the worst of it
168732 hasbro has an obligation to protect its intellectual property and will act appropriately when necessary
168733 we evaluate every situation on a case by case basis and have no comment regarding the scrabulous developers new application at this time
168734 i do think the cosmetic changes on the new wordscraper board and the removal of any links to scrabble rules or dictionaries help dodge the copyright bullet
168735 by giving the power to the end users to control the design of the board including presumably the ability to change the board design back to the scrabulous design hasbro could still pursue a contributory infringement claim if it wanted to under the active inducement test
168736 but to win hasbro would have to show that the designers actively encouraged gamers to change the board back to the old scrabulous so far they dont seem to be stepping over this line
168737 but i really missed the trash talking with friends there are some friends i dont get to see that much but i played scrabulous with them
168738 all of my friends are really upset with hasbro and electronic arts and they didnt want to have anything to do with the game
168739 and when i tried to fiddle with it it crashed on me so i gave up
168740 the distribution of these funds will naturally be handled by the palestinian finance ministry but the aid will go to assist the populations of both the west bank and the gaza strip
168741 this performance was carried by upstream activities which showed once again the good sensitivity of results to high prices for hydrocarbons
168742 in the second quarter demand for oil remained strong still pulled by middle east despite signs of a slowing in the atlantic basin
168743 tensions on world production capacity remain despite the increase in the contibution from saudi arabia
168744 geopolitical uncertainties or problems over security in several zones of growth and continuing decline in mature regions
168745 refining margins in europe rallied supported by the vigour of demand for distillates
168746 refining margins are in retreat from the average level in the second quarter while margins on distillates are still good
168747 in particular to the rapid increase of prices for naphta and the fall of demand in the altantic basin in the second quarter
168748 current market conditions mean it is imperative that the fsa reacts quickly to any potential abuse of the market
168749 this will not always uncover evidence of market abuse nor lead to enforcement action market participants should however expect that our surveillance and investigation activity will continue at a high level of intensity
168750 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s
168751 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
168752 the city of johannesburgs health department would like to encourage mothers to get their children immunised against polio and measles in order to help build up their childs defences against the diseases
168753 immunisation has been demonstrated in research trials and efficacy measurements to be one of the most effective public health interventions available
168754 placing the rest at risk of being exposed to a preventable childhood disease
168755 very few children in this age category have received the additional dose according to the statistics collected from clinics
168756 i am dying to try it out i think i may give frushi a go next week
168757 long long ago my friend came here for business and introduced me to dakar to sell chinese products
168758 i hope i can make a big market in africa in the future and maybe i will have good luck
168759 these people represent a new form of colonialism with an asian face that is coming to africa
168760 the influx of chinese business people onto the streets of dakar is quite a phenomenon
168761 one street the boulevard general de gaulle named after the french wartime leader could be called boulevard mao tse tung because it is dominated by the chinese
168762 when they came to africa three centuries ago they used the barrel of the gun
168763 they came with boats they controlled ports and forts and physically dominated places the chinese did it in a soft way
168764 the advance force that has allowed opening up of new territories including senegal and they were followed up later on by the big companies and then the political leaders
168765 they are very useful in the grand strategy that china is deploying across the world
168766 well see maybe one two three four maybe more if the market is suitable for me maybe i can stay here for a long time
168767 there is no strategic continental approach that african countries have adopted
168768 no think tank no task force no inclusion of chinese language into universities no coordinated approach this should be the role of the african union
168769 its an unbalanced relationship in which china knows what it wants and has a clearly defined agenda
168770 the question indeed is what is africa doing in the face of these challenges
168771 nothing its as if african countries are rushing to china bowl in hand and china naturally is in a best position to take advantage whereas african countries are almost powerless and just expecting china to be the new messiah
168772 china is in a position to be in the heart of africa
168773 and the west they are losing out if africa plays its cards well i think africa has never been in a better position

168780 i strive to preserve my fathers minhagim but i do have one tradition that i havent received from my father my father never owed millions of dollars for his mosdos
168781 when i close my eyes and try to relive the image of my father it is definitely the enthusiasm and bren that comes to mind
168782 it was a privilege for him to do a mitzvah he lived from mitzvah to mitzvah
168783 whether he was lighting chanukah licht baking matzos on erev pesach or shaking a lulav and esrog on succos thousands of people were inspired
168784 once when he was in his eighties he was in florida for a vacation and had to have a cataract removed
168785 my father turned to my sister and his gabbai and said did you hear that ive been putting on tefillin for 72 years and i still cant do it with my eyes closed each time he put them on it was like the first time

168787 naftoli my dear son know that the body of a jew is corporeal dust from the earth man can be killed but his soul is eternal and no murderer or evildoer in the world can harm the soul

168789 naftoli my dear one recall simchas torah in bobov and the tremendous simcha we feel when we dance during hakofos with the torah in our hands or the simcha of the baking of matzos on erev pesach and all of the simcha with which a jew should observe every single mitzvah especially that of kiddush hashem we have only a few more hours in which to live a few more hours until morning the only mitzvah we can still fulfill is that of kiddush hashem with all our heart the murderers will torture me with bitter and harsh torments because they will want to know the identities of the smugglers and those who make counterfeit affidavits i wont say a thing i will only shout shema yisroel hashem elokeinu hashem echod until my soul departs from my body when you see my tremendous suffering dont pay attention to it just shout shema yisroel too and dont fear anything in the world strengthen yourself and dont cry then because if you cry you might confuse me at this great sacred moment naftoli that is my final request to you will you listen to me
168790 tatte i will ask the murderers to kill me first because i surely wont be able to watch you suffer
168791 warped visions of sexuality may seem rampant in our culture but we all have the power to stand up to them
168792 his full time job was to do with law and he brought that expertise very much to dursley town council
168793 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
168794 they had a full camp set up with a sleeping area a kitchen even an area set up as a bathroom
168795 they used branches to make themselves shelves and had propane tanks for cooking
168796 we took about 2 000 pounds of marijuana off the street
168797 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade brad and angelina are the dream couple of the glossy magazine world and we expect to triple our circulation because of the publics fascination and interest in the couple and their children

168800 i texted him when i was coming over the st croix river and said whats wrong with this picture
168801 how many people are around me right now theres like 10 there would have been 150 people around him trying to ask him questions
168802 thirty million reasons why i dont know for jared its not about the money he just wanted a place that fit him and loved him
168803 i felt i made quick decisions that was my main focus make smart and quick decisions and i felt like i did that
168804 i thought he did a good job by and large
168805 whats more fun than being foolish making the most noise making the biggest burnout savoring the edge of disaster and insanity as we scream towards the finish line
168806 last time we repaired the sea wall we only had one bidder and fema had problems
168807 they could also have problems if its not the low bidder bohlmann felt that because of the power shutdown wed be ok
168808 if we want to do a majority of the sea wall go ahead and do it we could do 580 feet this winter and the rest in the spring
168809 on this project theyll rebuild the road from the center line to the wall
168810 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry
168811 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
168812 we are in discussion with several different countries states cities and individual companies around the world for future ev electric vehicles partnerships
168813 we have to draw a clear line of distinction between the pakistan government and rogue intelligence agencies
168814 if you know your history youll get what filmmaker john gianvitos up to a tapestry tribute to the standard bearers of americas progressive past a history disrespectful of governments and respectful of peoples movements of resistance per the films inspiration
168815 some of the names will be familiar from high school textbooks susan b anthony while others belong to the more specialized honor roll of the american left
168816 the absence of any explanatory apparatus limits the pedagogical effectiveness of profit motive and the whispering wind but if you know at least some of the names and some of the history it is a moving and intriguing reverie accompanying mr gianvitos film during its run at new left note a 26 minute silent collage of protest as much a document of as a documentary about the turbulence of the late 1960s
168817 unfortunately gianvito concludes with an overreaching link to contemporary activism introduced by foliage obscured shots of facades of shell wal mart and mcdonalds
168818 an unfortunate reminder of gianvitos hamfisted polemical fiction feature profit otherwise keenly connects these giants of americas past to the living more quietly in the presence of labor and feminist buttons next to flowers on gravesites or the plea etched on a female organizers tomb dont iron while the strike is hot
168819 weve brought our interactive technology to sports reality tv and awards shows and were excited to work on the beijing olympic games

168823 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
168824 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
168825 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
168826 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
168827 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
168828 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
168829 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
168830 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
168831 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
168832 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
168833 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am
168834 thats the main reason why i keep doing it its for a great cause
168835 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
168836 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
168837 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
168838 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
168839 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
168840 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
168841 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
168842 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
168843 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
168844 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
168845 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
168846 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
168847 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
168848 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
168849 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
168850 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
168851 les recettes de publicit sur juillet ne sont pas bonnes
168852 on est dans le droit fil de ce quon a connu ces derniers mois avec des annonceurs qui sont en retrait par rapport leurs investissements publicitaires
168853 la r alit des chiffres est aujourdhui de 250 et 280 millions tous les professionnels vous le diront
168854 cest curieux de voir quon na pas t m me de calculer plus justement les choses

168857 mr bateman said the new location was no more than 10 minutes drive away
168858 they seem to have developed some type of mechanism to deal with that high level of alcohol and not get drunk
168859 the amount of alcohol were talking about is huge its several times the legal limit in most countries so if we can figure out why these animals are able to cope with it perhaps it could be used to develop medicines to help people deal with alcohol poisoning
168860 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
168861 the worst one can do is try to beat microsoft at its own game using the same tricks or blind cooperation
168862 we would like to strike similar patent deals with all the linux vendors but we had to start somewhere
168863 pearly gates and em ballmer one promises you heaven and the other prepares you for the grave
168864 i dont know about you but im always fascinated to hear how others got started in blogging so im looking forward to reading all the entries
168865 the federations judicial commission said the second player did not commit a doping violation the sports rules state that a country must be disqualified from a tournament if more than one team member tests positive
168866 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for
168867 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
168868 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
168869 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
168870 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
168871 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
168872 i expected one of the english teams fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this card on one hand it is very very tough we know that but on the other very exciting
168873 i think whats damaged the labour party now is not gordon brown becoming prime minister
168874 its the long term consequences of the economic policies that were put in place whilst they were in opposition which all the party leadership signed up to most of the cabinet members now were researchers then and caught up in it all
168875 the moment you said were not going to increase tax on the rich you end up having to shuffle money between the working class the middle class poor people with families poor people without kids its a nightmare
168876 therefore changing the leader will not have the slightest effect you might get a temporary months bounce back but unless the policies change theyre stuck in the same contradictions
168877 the truth is mrs thatcher recognised number 10 was a platform to educate and change attitudes and labours never tried to do that in the last 11 years
168878 its never challenged the consensus that thatcher imposed on british policy and theyre trapped in it and theyve got to actually start saying whats our consensus wed like to build about where we want to take britain
168879 and so you could have any number of new leaders but unless they change policy their popularity will rapidly go back to where browns is now
168880 the economic pain is being unfairly concentrated on working class and middle class families
168881 when thatcher was elected the top 10 per cent of society earned four times more than the bottom 10 per cent
168882 today that figure is eight times and its not just the obscenity of the size of bonuses in the city but more importantly in many ways the tax regime
168883 you just have to say we made a mistake when your going through an economic downturn whether of not it becomes a recession the most pain should be felt by those best placed to cope with it and im quite happy that someone whos earning a million a year should bear the bulk of that pain rather than someone whose earning a couple of hundred quid a week
168884 working class people in low paid jobs are really getting a raw deal and theres a lot the government should be able to do to challenge that
168885 one of the best ways of actually helping people is to make it easier for unions to organise
168886 in the dining rooms the tables were bolted down but nothing else was and everything just went flying people were desperately trying to grab hold of things to keep safe
168887 it rolled a bit a bit of internal damage when things moved but thats what happens when ships move it was a cruise holiday you take whatever mother nature dishes out
168888 current market conditions mean it is imperative that the fsa reacts quickly to any potential abuse of the market
168889 this will not always uncover evidence of market abuse nor lead to enforcement action market participants should however expect that our surveillance and investigation activity will continue at a high level of intensity
168890 these are dire circumstances we cannot have a situation where 85 year olds could be cold this winter while the big energy companies are raking in big profits
168891 these rises are indecent if anything underlines the urgent need for a windfall tax on greedy energy companies its rises like these
168892 whatever people might wish whatever people singing songs in the sunshine at summer camps might idealise the world is going to be using lots of coal in the future
168893 this is an extremely worrying trend and one where proper action should be taken
168894 the healthcare commission survey also shows that patients need access to primary care at more convenient times
168895 since the survey took place the government has invested 250m in improving access and taken action to extend opening hours in gp practices over a quarter of gp practices have begun to offer extended opening hours and from 2009 the 152 new gp led health centres around the country will continue to improve provision
168896 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
168897 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
168898 edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
168899 the attitude of academies towards unions so far has been mixed with some showing scant regard for the role of unions in representing the workforce
168900 all academies need to engage with all the school workforce unions and todays agreement is an important step towards achieving this
168901 ultimately the government must change the regulations so that academies are no longer exempt from the national rules that all other schools follow regarding pay conditions and union recognition
168902 labour ministers have been caught red handed trying to fiddle election rules to give their incumbent labour mps an unfair advantage
168903 for a governing party to rig election rules just months before an election in order to cling onto power has all the hallmarks of a banana republic
168904 it is quite proper for the electoral commission to raise concerns over such partisan moves by the government and there is also a real prospect of a legal challenge in the courts against such flawed new laws
168905 we understand that the fda is simply trying to protect the american people but we think it needs to take a different approach
168906 they have to demonstrate that they have put preventive controls in place that are working
168907 the fda doesnt have the manpower to do as many inspections as needed to ensure the safety of the food supply its not that they cannot do their job they just dont have the resources
168908 you have importers distributors and foreign manufacturers that do not know what the rules are and its unclear how to keep your product from being banned
168909 bioshock had no multi player mode we dont believe in throwing in something that cant go head to head with the big boys no applicants will be considered who arent able to demonstrate theyve got the skills to build an industry changing multiplayer design
168910 we arent prepared to announce or discuss any features for bioshock 2 at this time
168911 take care when providing proprietary or confidential information to the eeoc
168912 disclosure of information does not violate the trade secrets act merely because that information was labeled confidential by the submitter
168913 sure wes ill bang something together using the starcluster ruleset
168914 i keep finding little niggling things i want to change about blood games magic especially
168915 what other nation continues to search for those lost in war for so long what other nation honors these war dead more and longer what other nation cares that much for the survivors
168916 we know that two people in that plane an f4 is a two seater did not survive and that bobby was one of those
168917 it was like a big load is lifted off your heart
168918 weve known for a good while we have felt this was bobbys crash site this is verification that hes not a prisoner he probably didnt suffer he was probably killed on impact
168919 there are hundreds that we can recover and identify there are a lot of families out there that can get the same closure we have if everybody will make sure thats not put on the back burner
168920 i must represent france and i want to be elegant and i want the french people to be proud of me you know
168921 i thought marriage was something very quiet and very regular and very bourgeois
168922 but i dont think it is at all especially with nicolas its full of adventure and full of fun
168923 mick had a child with a woman in brazil so the divorce didnt have much to do with me i must say
168924 im not really a femme fatale i was never an adulteress since i never got married
168925 i dont feel ashamed about my life and what ive done
168926 i have a past and i dont think its shocking you know i think it would be shocking for me to pretend not to have any past and also it would be a lie
168927 the new album was symbolic for me and my identity
168928 i care about writing music and playing my music i hope that france wouldnt mind the wife of the president having a job
168929 i dont expect people to separate them because i believe that its impossible
168930 what i hope is that if people like it they like it and if they dont like it it doesnt have much to do with my husband but much more to do with my music
168931 you are my junk more deadly than afghan heroin more dangerous than colombian white powder

168934 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
168935 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
168936 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
168937 the mdc believes that no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
168938 as long as there is no production we will continue to move in circles as a country
168939 i dont know if their wings or tired or what but they apparently prefer to walk not fly
168940 we could afford to fly but it was a nice day so we said what the hell says ira pigeon of queens on a sunny afternoon recently as they strolled through flushing
168941 thats a false analogy because you wouldnt call rats walking pigeons
168942 you need to address the things that are uppermost in peoples minds
168943 like what songs lindsay lohans dj girlfriend will be playing saturday night and what kind of cigarettes britney spears toddlers are smoking
168944 congressmen ada kabar baik dan ada kabar buruk pertama kabar baik dulu ya tuhan itu benar benar ada seperti yang kita yakini kabar buruk tuhan akan memusnahkan dunia ini dalam tiga hari

168947 we are proud that our dominator memory once again hit a new world record
168948 our proprietary technology used on dominator ddr3 allows for incredible overclocking results we believe our technology is far superior to any other when it comes to overclocking memory modules
168949 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
168950 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them
168951 i believe we will have elections in february or march and until then olmert will be prime minister
168952 they poor people could not give a damn about climate change because they want 24 hours a day light
168953 we expect to start our dth business by mid september
168954 i dont think it will affect demand in a big way
168955 you just feel part of nature this is so rare
168956 he turned himself in and confessed to murdering his sister to cleanse his familys honour because she disappeared from home for four months with a man
168957 he killed her the moment she returned home last night but forensic tests showed that the girl was a virgin
168958 i want to see with my own eyes because its really hot in the news so i came on a bus with the neighbours
168959 what 7 s the matter cant talk with a gun in your mouth

168966 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
168967 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
168968 the company has decided to invest a significant amount of money in cloud computing make some noise for us
168969 the s ystem takes already treated wastewater from the sanitation district next door and sends it through a rigorous three step cleaning process
168970 technologically its almost trivial for us to do this now the key is to get public acceptance and political buy in
168971 today women are not only the most powerful consumers in the world were also the power users of web 2 0 and social media technologies

168978 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
168979 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
168980 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
168981 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
168982 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
168983 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
168984 album staying power value sales value critical rating value grammy award value
168985 men who come closer to fulfilling their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
168986 differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small
168987 of course one doesnt have to be married to be happy but if thats something you really want and it is for most people then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness
168988 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
168989 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
168990 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
168991 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
168992 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
168993 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
168994 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
168995 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
168996 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
168997 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
168998 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
168999 following a recent conference call with union officials we believe that there is a high chance greater than 70 percent of a work stoppage at boeing commercial airplanes in the near future

169001 i got it from my mama i got it from my mama
169002 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
169003 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
169004 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
169005 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
169006 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
169007 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned

169037 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
169038 his behavior was correct at the same time he wants to sabotage the proceedings
169039 those are lies i do not comment on any longer
169040 at the end of the day there may not be the evidence there to mount a homicide inquiry and an attempt to bring anybody to justice for whatever crimes took place there
169041 we were pinning our hopes on the process of carbon dating
169042 the latest information were getting is that for the period were looking at its not going to be possible to give us an exact time of death
169043 the indications are that if the results come back the same way as they have now it is obvious there wont be a homicide inquiry

169048 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
169049 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
169050 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
169051 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
169052 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
169053 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
169054 in a short time we caught hundreds of species 10 of which may be new to science it was unreal unbelievable
169055 catching is the easy bit the hard bit is going back to the lab and examining the species comparing them to collections and books seeing if they are new to science one hour in the field can equal hundreds of hours in the lab
169056 the expedition captured on film the discovery of the strongest candidates for new species two fishes
169057 it was quite a thrill luring this spider the size of a soup plate out of its hole and holding it although i can see that this wouldnt be everyones idea of fun
169058 we have a choice we really are at the cross roads now we can decide to keep these rich hotspots of nature or see them razed to the ground

169072 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
169073 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
169074 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
169075 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
169076 let us resolve that never again will we send the precious young blood of this country to die trying to prop up a corrupt military dictatorship abroad
169077 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
169078 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
169079 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
169080 they want to buy the technology they want to own it and they want to operate it
169081 we dont want to get into the surveillance business ourselves so theyre simply going to put it on our fence
169082 there will be absolutely no additional impediment to the golf course
169083 there will be no gate there will be no checkpoint there will be none of that that we had at first been concerned about
169084 center on the ut brownsville campus to study such border issues as alternatives to physical barriers
169085 were going to make sure that the palestinians have a state that allows them to prosper as long as we also have certainty that israels security is not being compromised
169086 i think its in the interest of both parties but we are the critical ingredient in terms of making sure that a deal actually gets done
169087 then that will make it easier for arab states and the gulf states to support us when it comes to issues like iraq and afghanistan
169088 it also will weaken iran which has been using hamas and hezbollah as a way to stir up mischief in the region if weve gotten an israeli palestinian peace deal maybe at the same time peeling syria out of the iranian orbit that makes it easier to isolate iran so that they have a tougher time developing a nuclear weapon
169089 give s the bush administration credit that the annapolis process has gotten prime minister ehud olmert and president mahmoud abbas to have very serious discussions they may not be able to finish the job they certainly cant finish it without serious participation by the next administration and weve got to start early
169090 the middle east is not going to get better without the creation of a palestinian state to live side by side with israel in peace security and democracy
169091 palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has appealed to the world bank to help him secure emergency financing to bridge a shortfall in donor funds and pay public workers
169092 budget crisis despite billions of dollars in aid pledged last year to support a u s backed peace drive
169093 the state department said the u s had already surpassed its 555 million in pledged support for 2008 to the pa and urged other donors to help out
169094 many arab states have not met their financial commitments despite pressure from washington
169095 workers in gaza say hamas which receives support from iran and other islamist allies has been paying salaries on time despite the western boycott
169096 jordan has quietly let the bush white house know it is concerned over the prospect of an independent palestinian state in the west bank jordanian officials said jordans king abdullah has warned the administration that such a state would fuel the islamic opposition and could lead to an attempt to overthrow the kingdom
169097 were going to make sure that the palestinians have a state that allows them to prosper as long as we also have certainty that israels security is not being compromised
169098 jordan has quietly let the bush white house know it is concerned over the prospect of an independent palestinian state in the west bank
169099 on the basis of the evidence assembled here it seems beyond dispute that grover norquist has formed alliances with prominent islamic radicals who have ties to the saudis and to libya and to palestine islamic jihad and who are now under indictment by u s authorities equally troubling is that the arrests of these individuals and their exposure as agents of terrorism have not resulted in noticeable second thoughts on grovers part or any meaningful effort to dissociate himself from his unsavory friends
169100 made repeated ad hominem attacks on fox tv and elsewhere against me and anyone else including noted experts like daniel pipes and steve emerson who dared to warn about the dangers of islamism more often than not he portrayed such warnings as bigoted racist denunciations of all muslims
169101 i would like nothing better than a flowering a renaissance in the muslim world including full equality of rights for women and non muslims in islamic societies freedom of conscience equality in laws regarding legal testimony equal employment opportunities etc
169102 so you would like to see us ditch much of our religion and thereby become non muslims
169103 let us not forget that marxism as the one great political force of our twentieth century made its appearance with the claim to be bringing a new world of freedom and of free people this very promise of knowing the scientifically guaranteed way to freedom and of creating the new world drew to it many of the boldest spirits of our age ultimately it even appeared as the force through which the christian teaching of redemption could be transformed into a realistic practical means for liberation as the force that could bring the kingdom of god as the true kingdom of men the collapse of realist socialism in the east european states has not quite laid aside all such hopes and here and there they still subsist silently awaiting some new form
169104 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule it
169105 we have one man who understands hes a mere mortal like the rest of us and one man who seems to think he is a god

169116 look for this in campaign ads all across the nation
169117 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
169118 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
169119 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
169120 its pure snobbery however good a horsewoman i may be im also a glamor model that embarrassed the organizers
169121 eliza doolittle went to the races with henry higgins after a few elocution lessons in pretty woman julia roberts went to the polo straight from sunset boulevard but in the 21st century we have become even more class ridden unless you are a toff or an aspiring actress they dont want you
169122 all my life ive been surrounded by horses i earned my pocket money sweeping out stables and i now have six horses
169123 ive been invited to take part in the horse of the year show ive even played a charity polo match at cowdray park
169124 i know more about fetlocks and forelocks than most of the celebrities invited by cartier and the chinawhite nightclub ive certainly mucked out more horses
169125 and there will be no discussion of the religious faith that was the motivation for the pilgrims to come to the new world
169126 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
169127 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
169128 well ok i think john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
169129 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
169130 it is quite clear you took advantage of this young woman in a disgraceful way
169131 you knew perfectly well she could not possibly be consenting to your sexual advances
169132 you have more of a sexual problem than you are prepared to admit
169133 the three workers quickly managed to operate their industrial cherry picker towards the stricken man
169134 the tide was rapidly coming in and the man was in danger of drowning
169135 the workers managed to reach the man and hold his head above water
169136 once firefighters arrived they reached the man via a ladder washed the mud off his face and placed breathing apparatus on to the mans face in case the water came over into his mouth
169137 the man was incredibly lucky that workers on the quayside had seen him in the mud
169138 its thanks to the quick thinking of the workers who came to his rescue as soon as they saw him in danger that he survived
169139 al franken has made millions of dollars attacking and mocking the religious beliefs of millions of americans for laughs especially catholics
169140 however by joking about a gift store that sells small pieces of the skeleton of jesus christ and mocking the catholic faith by imitating priests as pedophiles receiving communion or dogs taking part in confession franken has violated the bounds of decency and religious tolerance it is not satire it is not humor it is religious bigotry on his radio show al franken has called the church idiotic because of its concerns about protecting the sanctity of life in the debate over research with human embryos there is not an element of the catholic church that franken hasnt been unwilling to treat with scorn derision and intolerance
169141 if you have a few hundred followers and you let some of them molest children they call you a cult leader if you have a billion they call you pope
169142 al franken wants to represent minnesota in the united states senate yet he accepts donations from a man who equates the catholic church with being filled with child molesters and that the pope is the leader of a church of pedophiles it is beyond my comprehension that a man who shows such an easy display of catholic bigotry thinks he should be elected to serve a state in which 25 of the population is catholic
169143 making reference first to the arrest of polygamists suspected of having sex with children in texas maher said that whenever a cult leader sets himself up as gods infallible wingman here on earth lock away the kids
169144 bill you cant be saying the catholic church is no better than this creepy texas cult for one thing altar boys cant even get pregnant
169145 talk show host bill maher last week accused pope benedict xvi of being a nazi in his youth and heading up a child abusing religious cult or more precisely the bear stearns of organized pedophilia
169146 the following week maher offered a correction not an apology when he said he would never make a pope is a nazi joke again but he added that it if the pope was the ceo of a chain of nationwide day care centers and had helped cover up that thousands of his employees had been caught molesting children he would be in jail
169147 the president made one hundred and forty digs in the deserts of the holy land discovering among other artifacts the complete skeleton of jesus christ still nailed to the cross
169148 you know if it were up to me id take one of those bones and clone jesus im kidding of course human cloning is a crime and also impossible to do from tissue that is no longer living also speaking from personal experience i can tell you that any clone of jesus christ would have a lot of issues
169149 the complete set of video clips of helicopter rescue squad is available in the gift shop along with most of my books and small pieces of jesus skeleton
169150 actually god he asked me to write this book because he was so pissed off at bush who claimed that he had been chosen by god and god said actually he hadnt it was chosen by clarence thomas
169151 just to set the mood al franken starts lies with a few lies of his own
169152 you know those shitty books by ann coulter and bernie goldberg the best sellers that claim there is a liberal bias in the media i asked total bullsh t god said
169153 i guess it was god who had his head up his a
169154 so i asked god where exactly in the bible he said that
169155 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish because they did not receive the love of truth so as to be saved
169156 i dont care what kind of nonsense you believe i can tell you that religion will be a crutch which you can lean upon in times of adversity
169157 well i do too were going to leave alone the catholic churchs idiotic stance on this issue
169158 two attempts at humor were offensive in his oy oy show set to israeli music a sidekick reads news reports in this case the murder of the russian backed president of chechnya frankens role is to pipe up with a lighthearted oy oy oy yep nothing tickles the ribs like assassination franken also imitated a priest giving communion saying body of christ when an imagined pedophile priest was in line but not for you when pro choice politicians came up
169159 i was raised a catholic so church for me is ah you know full of all the catholic rituals and so
169160 and the wine can you have more can you have like the wafers theyre not just like you dont just get the wine right
169161 you dont get you cant make a sandwich or anything
169162 is that a sacrilege i see joel shaking your head there
169163 is it just like should i just not run for the senate now
169164 so its no small ah its no small thing and its
169165 rightly so sorry everybody i apologize laughing i really do that was i i i mumbling
169166 all season long saturday night live creator lorne michaels tried to get a sketch called dog confessional approved written by al franken it depicted a series of dogs played by cast members confessing to a priest nbc censor richard gitter says it would have offended catholics
169167 snl and the censors nbc holds the line against controversy
169168 thus when i emceed fund raisers for mark greens 86 senate race id open with ive been asked by the green campaign to announce that the views i express tonight are mine and not necessarily those of the green campaign okay now that thats out of the way
169169 i tell you one thing if mary magdalene looked like barbary hershey i might have thought twice about this celibacy thing i mean the real mary magdalene was about four foot two 135 pounds and with bad teeth yet
169170 we should be allowed to swim in the lake wherever we want to
169171 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country

169181 with the state of the market as it is chances are pretty remote you have news international and trinity mirror walking around saying we can print everything because they have so much space
169182 news international are desperate to fill their 85 000 copies per hour presses until they have virtually cornered the market then watch their prices go up
169183 with the reduction in advertising revenue and circulation along with the most dramatic increase in newspaper printing capacity we have ever seen in the uk it is inevitable that this will continue to happen

169197 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
169198 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who could have been a good australian citizen
169199 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
169200 im disappointed though i really wish that he would not have said some of the things that he said in anger of course and started pointing the finger

169302 please notice that peter did not declare healing to every beggar at the temple gate that day but only to one in particular there is no basis anywhere in the new testament for mechanical assembly line operation of any spiritual gift according to some whim of the christian believer rather every indication is that we need to be open and obedient to the moving and sovereign mind of the holy spirit
169303 we all must honor and love the word of god but there is no getting around that the bible makes tremendous statements about the spirit of god
169304 without getting into the debates that have arisen about speaking in tongues let us focus on the main point of this passage god by his spirit enabled ordinary men and women to do and say things beyond their natural abilities they became supernaturally empowered there was no human explanation for what was taking place
169305 the christian life like the life of jesus on earth is a combination of waiting and activity of prayer and service jesus spent time alone with the father in solitary places and then went forth in power to face incredibly busy days of ministry to needy people likewise we must balance all our activities for him with time spent with him waiting in expectant prayer and worship we must avoid the idea that well intentioned christian service and doing things for god will ever amount to much without fresh infillings of the spirits power

169340 back home people think of him as one of us or at least one who understands us
169341 my german is not real good i can speak bahasi indonesian sic but i dont think there would be a lot of appeal to that
169342 dia barry dijulukin si lentik barry karena bulu matanya lentik sekali rambutnya keriting khas orang afrika
169343 dia tak pernah memilih milih teman sampai suka jajan di kios kamid
169344 er war nie w hlerisch mit wem er sich angefreundet hat so sehr da er sogar gern beim kiosk kamid naschen ging
169345 i must represent france and i want to be elegant and i want the french people to be proud of me you know
169346 i thought marriage was something very quiet and very regular and very bourgeois
169347 but i dont think it is at all especially with nicolas its full of adventure and full of fun
169348 we will succeed in covering the entire country in the next two years or so
169349 there are certain indicators that there will be even more visitors than last year
169350 i feel like mothers do before christmas they just arrive at six
169351 it is considered good methodology to limit operations when business is good
169352 many pointed that out when decisions were made on power plants their timing was bad considering business cycles
169353 the authorities are supposed to undertake projects during a downswing and save during an upswing
169354 the world is supposed to be about harnessing natural resources to create capital goods
169355 but the big issue is the attitude the social democrats sveinbjarnard ttirs party have towards harnessing the countrys natural resources it is very peculiar how this project is being handled by the ministries of industry and environment
169356 there are clearly conflicts within the party if they cannot solve this problem it is very unfortunate in my opinion
169357 it is of course not painless to let them go
169358 im really sorry that i cant understand 100 percent of what he says
169359 going electric helps to ensure precision that can make a rider faster and reduce mental fatigue
169360 there is a certain novelty factor for those enthusiasts that like to indulge in the latest high tech equipment or use the same equipment that professionals use
169361 in our view the risk seems minimal that the cra would use its authority to audit a taxpayer who is not personally suspected of non compliance merely to investigate other unnamed taxpayers for non compliance
169362 it is an incredible sight to see all of these motorcyclists whove given up their time and their money to come support these babies and the march of dimes and i get goose bumps every time i think about it and its an amazing sight and an amazing afternoon
169363 there have been some terrific research breakthroughs that have helped babies be born healthy there have also been great breakthroughs to help correct birth defects before as soon as that infant is born or while theyre in the womb so there have been some terrific research breakthroughs but we still have a lot to do
169364 i couldnt believe the news when i saw the news on wednesday and they said we have been suspended i kept on asking myself why is this was happening to us i even called the national team coach straight away to get a bit of clarity on the issue
169365 he did confirm that we have been suspended but said the issue will be resolved either this week or next weekend he gave me hope that we will still play our qualifier next month against morocco at home because we need to win that game to boost our chances of qualifying
169366 i have a good working relationship with krol and the rest of the technical team i have already learnt a lot from krol during the few days that i have been here i am grateful for my appointment as it will enable me to better my coaching skills
169367 i wish maritzburg well in the coming season whatever happened is now history i have moved on i have a new job with one of the biggest teams in the continent to concentrate on and it would therefore be folly to be still thinking about my split with maritzburg
169368 our focus is cash flow and liquidity that is our focus
169369 none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with microsoft or any other party
169370 i believe we should never have to make these kinds of choices ever again
169371 the big question is when will states hit the bottom we dont know
169372 i will not be able to pay my rent buy food or put gas in my car to transport my children
169373 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
169374 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
169375 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
169376 we finally look forward to the opportunity to examine fully mr arthurs claim of innocence by assessing witness testimony and dna evidence
169377 whenever a judge decides to afford a person the right to be heard it means our system is working
169378 anytime a judge acts in a situation with the level of intensity present here we need to stop and commend that courage
169379 better direct resources at the trial stage to ensure quality representation
169380 its definitely something the industry is talking about right now
169381 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
169382 you dont have to be jewish to celebrate christmas but it helps
169383 to attempt to be both jewish and christian at once is spiritual schizophrenia
169384 all the sensitivity of a bactrian camel with a compound fracture of the spine
169385 never mind that he levin tries to insult me he may be right it is certainly the case that an abler copywriter would have penned a better advertisement for the gospel
169386 god blesses our efforts there will then be an abundance of deft godly writers and spokespeople who will be able to communicate the thrilling news that jesus is the saviour of jew and gentile with the skill and sensitivity for which mr levin yearns
169387 frankly i just had a good time having an argument
169388 we could have been talking about film about philosophy it didnt really matter we were just having a good banter
169389 it was really really tough and what that did for me was it just slowed me down i had a bit more time to think
169390 steve was a christian in the same college as me
169391 he started to talk to me about jesus in a different way than other people had there were some people absolutely brilliant at arguing points but this guy was quieter and you couldnt really have a debate with him that wasnt really his style he came along and just asked gentler questions
169392 this is real god opened up my heart if you like it was a moment of surrender really and it was in some ways as sweet as a kiss as natural as a kiss so thats how i became a follower of jesus
169393 i loved it the people the creativity the pace was fantastic
169394 i started learning a bit more about theword of god through the efforts of a home group teacher lewis trippett
169395 as i got turned on to the bible it helped me to see the people around me in a different way and i wanted to learn more
169396 jews for jesus why not after all jesus is for jews
169397 high profile jews who successfully persuaded london transport to scrap a jews for jesus advertising campaign this month may have shot themselves in the foot
169398 we shall advertise again but dont need to at the moment the effective protests have given us a very high profile
169399 jesus radically changed my life and i believe the same change is possible for anyone else jew or gentile
169400 people want something thats real not just thinking life is the next cappuccino or the next new dress or the next match the very heart of it is that they want to make their life count and i really think that jesus is the only way the only person that can take an ordinary life and make it extraordinary
169401 i just dont want to be there when it happens
169402 can we know the universe its hard enough finding your way around in chinatown
169403 glibness is allens antidote to grappling with the hard questions the eternal is brought down to the level of the earthly and therefore minimized
169404 its curious and a bit ironic that houghton mifflin lacks an ordinary sense of humor and as a literary organization cannot detect parody
169405 the jews for jesus in philadelphia have been cloning themselves to increase their numbers theyre everywhere
169406 jews for jesus jews for jesus i wanna wanna chop you into pieces jews for jesus jews for jesus i hope you get lots of diseases
169407 jews for jesus and also for really pissing off ones parents even if they werent religious in a way that the hare krishnas cant even begin to imagine
169408 it just seemed odd that someone with a name like ben stein would be so up in arms about things so closely associated with fundamentalist christians so i was wondering if perhaps hes one of those jews for jesus or perhaps hes not a jew at all
169409 the products and forms of expression and identity that are frequently encountered or widely accepted commonly liked or approved and characteristic of a particular society at a given time
169410 you can be either jewish or christian you cant be both if you ask a person politically what are you and he says i am a democrat and i am a republican or somebody else says im an atheist and im a christian impossible youre one or the other
169411 heres the minority report there are some of us jews who do believe that jesus is the messiah who do believe that there are messianic prophecies concerning a suffering servant who would come and suffer and die for the sins of the people and rise again and those of us who believe that are no less jewish
169412 jews for jesus est 32 a d give or take a year
169413 truth is not determined by popular opinion or majority vote a thing may be and often is true even when accepted only by the minority
169414 barack obama has played the elderly white republican card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
169415 hes just trying to scare the young non white democrats into not voting for
169416 im just surprised they feel its so important that they bring down an officer of the congress in order to get some attention toward the election its really sad that they would feel that insecure
169417 a supremely beautiful building which represents a turning point in turkish architectural style before this turkish mosques echoed the persian style but in the yesil camii a purely turkish style emerges
169418 were below our estimates primarily because of higher than expected expenses and slightly lower than projected net trading revenues
169419 those factors were partially offset by a lower tax rate we presume related to the companys ongoing cost cutting efforts
169420 not a good follow up to what had been a very positive first quarter result
169421 the issue is how management will position expense management going forward including the impact of the recent voluntary resignation program which was partially responsible for 38 million in severance payments during the quarter
169422 nadie en la tierra cree en la posibilidad de mi absoluci n
169423 i hope other museums do follow and i think they will
169424 the idea of game playing is much more common in science museums and we are not as familiar with the practice in art museums
169425 what for many adults is perceived as too dangerous is fun for her
169426 there are obstacles and you need to plan in advance what you need to eat when you need to rest
169427 it brings up patience and self control in children you must be focused and concentrated and attentive in what youre doing
169428 i like to eat when i get to the top
169429 the other would be control of bleeding if you could cauterize or laser a source of bleeding that would be a major therapeutic use
169430 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
169431 the scheme is offered to all competitors in the fsti championship for finland rally this will be called the expert award each competitor who displays the logo adjacent to the rally door plate is entitled to a cash back m sport voucher and is entered into the award scheme
169432 we can now concentrate on finding out who is responsible for this it is completely unacceptable
169433 people have a legal responsibility to get rid of chemicals safely so they do not harm the countryside or people
169434 were lucky we found this trailer before anyone else did
169435 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her
169436 theres a part of me that feels this was in the works for some time and lee just gave them the ammunition they needed to be able to lower the boom
169437 we consider this a personnel issue and we are not at liberty to discuss it
169438 just because they didnt like what she had to say
169439 letter writing campaigns are under way to get ms littman who will continue blogging at her site saramerica livejournal com her job back and she said she would consider returning if asked
169440 we tend to use our knowledge about people to understand the world of things
169441 with children with autism and aspergers they tend to use their knowledge about things to understand people
169442 when he was big enough to barely walk he was traveling on the train every morning we got up and went somewhere if it wasnt out of town it was on the subway
169443 he wanted to lean over the track and see the train coming
169444 om wienia polityki cenowej i przyj cia rodk w stabilizuj cych rynek
169445 sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse are two of the most serious and damaging crimes in our society
169446 its easily obtained and easily recycled and if we see someone with a lot of copper even if it could have been stolen theres no way to know where it came from
169447 our question is why cant they find the people who are buying it
169448 what if you had a stolen identification or you lie
169449 its very hard on our end too because there are honest people out there who dont do this thing
169450 as soon as someone brought that in we reported it
169451 my favorite part is when i get in the ring
169452 there is always a concern that any sort of incident will make people consider whether they want to come out and there may be people who took that to heart and did not come
169453 i think people understand it was an isolated incident and there are so many wonderful things to see at the fair
169454 it is unfortunate it happened and it is unfortunate it happened the first day
169455 i think a lot more people are making this their family vacation or their second family vacation
169456 there are a lot of returnees people are coming back a second third or fourth time from talking to people on the fairgrounds
169457 we just think its prudent given the very dry spring and hot days weve had
169458 the husband heard the door opening and went to investigate thats when the wife heard the gunshots
169459 am i for sending more troops to afghanistan because i really think we can win there because i really think that that will bring an end to terrorism or am i just doing it because to get elected in america post 9 11 i have to be for winning some war
169460 karzai was playing us like a fiddle the u s would spend billions of dollars on infrastructure improvement the u s and its allies would fight the taliban karzais friends could get rich off the drug trade he could blame the west for his problems and in 2009 he would be elected to a new term
169461 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining the more responsibility we take in afghanistan the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly our claims that afghanistan is the front line in the war on terror and that failure is not an option have convinced the afghan government that we need it more than it needs us the worse things become the more assistance it seems to receive this is not an incentive to reform
169462 miss spears was reluctant to agree to the extension of her conservatorship
169463 wonderful things for the confidence of black people around the world
169464 have a beneficial influence on the self image of some of londons black male youth
169465 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
169466 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
169467 i think republican candidate john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
169468 my legs are steel springs and every day i get out of bed and i beat my chest
169469 every morning i am full of wonderment that the people of london have done the honour of making me their mayor i really am
169470 we do not favour a particular candidate and we would certainly not get involved in another nations domestic elections
169471 wonderful things for the confidence of black people around the world

169478 we do not favour a particular candidate and we would certainly not get involved in another nations domestic elections
169479 it is an interesting process just being in an action movie is funny in that our producer is neal moritz who does all these action movies like the fast and the furious and i am legend
169480 so for notes were used to judd apatow who will say make the emotions real
169481 its very personal with a father and son theme loosely based on his own life

169483 die einigung zwischen ver di und der lufthansa benachteiligt das kabinen gegen ber dem bodenpersonal und die gehaltserh hungen fallen viel zu niedrig aus eine echte augenwischerei
169484 notfalls werden wir daf r auch streiken wenn unser tarifvertrag ende des jahres ausl uft
169485 ein gdl ph nomen wollte man bei der lufthansa ganz eindeutig vermeiden und die tarifeinheit der branche wahren
169486 wenn die gewerkschaft ihre daseinsberechtigung nicht verlieren will dann kommt sie kaum umhin den ver di kompromiss abzulehnen
169487 der unterschied zwischen lohnerh hungen bei ver di und den forderungen bei ufo ist daf r einfach zu hoch
169488 die achillesferse des unternehmens sind die hochqualifizierten techniker und die piloten
169489 sie lassen sich nur schwer ersetzen und k nnen dem unternehmen wie gesehen mit einem streik erheblichen schaden zuf gen
169490 im falle eines arbeitskampfes k nnte die lufthansa das streikende personal problemlos durch leiharbeiter ersetzen
169491 takes place in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
169492 the united states should firmly curb the odious conduct of a small group of anti china lawmakers the resolution itself is blasphemy to the olympic spirit and is against the common wishes of people around the world including people in the united states
169493 one of the reasons that the date was changed was in order to do the extra scenes which they were always going to do if they felt the film warranted it theyve added some new stuff and people are very excited about it

169496 it is slicing the bread the slices are always uneven or the bread gets squished or the slices are too big to use for sandwiches
169497 the pith is the soft white stuff under the zest
169498 se tem vindo a comportar de um modo geral de um modo bastante racional e eficiente nas ltimas semanas e meses
169499 a descida dos pre os tem sido ordeira n o um rebentar de bolha e um ajustamento gentil de volta a um n vel de pre os cujo equil brio potencial no longo prazo tem sido sujeita a muito no que a n veis de investiga o e testes diz respeito
169500 perfeitamente consistente com os par metros e din micas actuais do mercado
169501 de momento vemos os pre os a moverem se substancialmente dentro desta varia o antes de voltarem a subir novamente nos pr ximos meses
169502 o mercado como estando num processo sustentado de atrito em direc o a um n vel de pre os mais baixo
169503 o lado da procura n o parece estar na realidade t o fr gil como o sentimento actual do mercado enquanto este sentimento frequentemente afectado e infectado por rumores de destrui o da procura consideramos estes argumentos como algo pouco convincentes para n s o processo um de reac o produra uma vez que at agora foi verificada pouca destrui o permanente da procura
169504 ainda s o o rato que n o ruge e a sua traject ria ainda decepcionante em rela o s expectativas

169508 feels good to wake up every day and write music with your friends again
169509 weve thrown back a beer or two together as well
169510 he is knocking at my door to hear anything good or bad i have to say ive never heard of a principal doing this
169511 i want the kids and the parents to feel like saghalies a place where people care
169512 im going door to door giving information about the start of school
169513 advantageous for him to get out and meet the parents of the young people going to his school
169514 ive never seen a principal go out and meet the people before
169515 youve got to stand in awe of his willingness to do that
169516 if youve met him then youve got a better chance of working together
169517 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
169518 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
169519 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favor to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
169520 we have nothing to say fifa is not going to intervene let it be as it is now
169521 i expected one of the english teams fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this card on one hand it is very very tough we know that but on the other very exciting
169522 qu tipo de regularidad puede haber cuando todo tiene lugar en una atm sfera en la que independientemente de que la verdad pueda ser demostrada en esta sala nadie en la tierra cree en la posibilidad de mi absoluci n
169523 en 1996 en nombre de estados unidos richard holbrooke el negociador estadounidense hizo una oferta a los ministros y hombres de estado que eran mis representantes autorizados comprometi ndose a que yo no ser a juzgado por este tribunal
169524 incapaz de cumplir sus compromisos tomados en nombre de estados unidos pas al plan b la eliminaci n de radovan karadzic
169525 s lo puedo imaginar que su defensa ser pol tica
169526 la familia de karadzic siempre ha dicho que tiene pruebas del acuerdo secreto asegur
169527 los soldados de la otan no lo arrestaban cuando pasaba ante sus ojos para ir de su casa a su oficina
169528 no hubo un acuerdo secreto pero lo que es cierto es que no hubo una real intenci n de detenerlo
169529 al menos que no pueda probarlo no ser til para el tribunal y as karadzic convertir esto en un juicio pol tico
169530 trata de salvar su honor probablemente no tiene mucho que ganar en este juicio lo hace por cierta audiencia serbia quiere mostrar lo injusto que es esto y se presenta a s mismo como un hombre que hizo la paz
169531 but you must not even think of settlement during the war

169535 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
169536 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
169537 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
169538 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
169539 im going to send my car in and get it tuned up and make sure they check the tires

169547 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
169548 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
169549 we have managed to discover and dismantle a method of introducing heroin by sea which was unknown to date even at the european level which is especially dangerous

169551 ferie og fritidsmarkedet over resund er g et mere eller mindre i st men vi har den stadig store v kst i pendlingen som samlet set giver en trafikv kst p broen
169552 husholdningerne har f rre midler til oplevelser og ferier som f lge af h jere renteomkostninger og stigende priser p f devarer og benzin
169553 det kan man godt sige det er helt klart en af de sv reste modstandere som vi overhovedet kunne tr kke men det m siges at v re s dvanligt fc midtjylland uheld efter at vi sidste r r g ud mod en meget sv r russisk modstander men selvf lgelig g r vi efter chancen m ske undervurderer manchester city os under alle omst ndigheder bliver det meget sv rt ikke mindst p deres hjemmebane
169554 det er klart at vi h ber at kunne g re det samme mod manchester city som vel er et hold p samme niveau som aston villa men vi er godt klar over at vores chancer for at g videre umiddelbart ikke er de st rste
169555 jeg m indr mme at det ikke umiddelbart er den bedste lodtr kning for os vi kunne godt have f et en lettere modstander men omvendt har vi som m ls tning at komme i gruppespillet og derfor er vi n dt til at vinde de kampe som vi skal deltage i s dan er det
169556 det er et st rkt hold som spiller meget fysisk og med lange bolde da vi m dte dem i royal league gav de os mange problemer og h rd fight s det er bestemt en sv r opgave der venter os n glen tror jeg bliver at vi kommer i gang med hurtigt spil langs jorden det bryder de sig ret meget om til geng ld skal vi v re gode til at st kke deres lange bolde som de er gode til at f lge op p

169585 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted

169710 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
169711 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
169712 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days

169726 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
169727 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
169728 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
169729 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
169730 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
169731 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
169732 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply

169736 almost a parody of george w bushs 2000 and 2004 exertions
169737 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
169738 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
169739 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
169740 its ridiculous its offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it
169741 obama injected this yesterday we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again

169766 and of course the parents are really happy and over the moon its a wonderful time
169767 by choosing not to be as ambitious as i might have been i get to go to a restaurant with my family and there are no cameras around the corner
169768 and i dont have to worry about the car being chased or being involved in an accident
169769 by moving to london i removed myself from the madness of the entertainment industry

169774 i try to abide by rules and regulations if you break the law then you must pay the penalty and i think naomi understands that very well herself
169775 i really dont think shes using drugs now being diagnosed with the early stage of emphysema was a real jolt to her a bit of a wake up call
169776 shes got a constant p a personal assistant by her side a minder plus theres a security guard watching her i think things are really beginning to take shape to the good
169777 i spoke to shia in the hospital his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
169778 the kid really has his head together and you know hes only 22 hes doing a great job on this movie he has really matured since the last one and i love working with him
169779 i might try to wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm lucas production company and write an episode of the new live action star wars tv series

169784 nobody will be surprised to see jennifer there for the last stop it will be a big night for him and jennifer loves south florida
169785 ive been married for 32 years and never cheated on her because im addicted to her
169786 banning us was the greatest thing that could ever have happened we were sending her roses every day to say thank you and she couldnt figure out why well we sold out a major london venue because of that
169787 i thought id fall back into it naturally but at first it felt odd i was having a hard time finding scullys voice
169788 it wasnt until day three or four when i had scenes with david and we were working together again that i felt comfortable thats when i felt id come home
169789 within the first lesson i got up on the board but im on my sixth lesson now and i dont get up all the time on sunday i got up twice but i tried it 10 times
169790 but i feel that way about acting too i dont think you become excellent at what you do by being great at it from the very beginning my first acting teacher said its about chipping away at it every day
169791 i feel like i still continue to do that try to chip away at it and become more excellent at what i do but its never easy

169795 my intention was always to go to the convention to support hillary clinton
169796 i still believe in her i believe in her campaign and i would like to maintain my status as a supporter of hillary clinton
169797 im looking at this thing and im like what the hell is this
169798 ive never had an experience like this with this campaign or others
169799 i thought they crossed the line if you have a problem with a story i write call me first im a big boy i can handle it but they never called they attacked me like im a political opponent
169800 you cant stop whats bout to happen we bout to make history the first black president is destined and its meant to be the threats aint fazing us the nooses or the jokes so get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote
169801 paint the white house black im sure thats got em terrified
169802 obama has a problem among women over 40 and a big problem among women over 50 these groups normally the staunchest of democratic supporters are showing a propensity to back mccain
169803 if we hand out leaflets they tend to get chucked away
169804 it uses positive commands to try to get people to relax more quickly
169805 if we can stop a fatality or even a serious injury that 2 000 is laughably small
169806 robbed her because it was her turn to be president
169807 i found it hard to explain to anyone how only 45 republicans vote for that bill
169808 dealing with people who dont want to give health care to poor little children in america
169809 better to win and screw the public than not to win at all
169810 i believe this self representation business is a sham i suspect some big money organization or a wealthy benefactor is providing the finances for this obscene abuse of the legal system and the us constitutions separation of church and state tradition are christians really going to allow some gay activist and a black robed lawyer decide how the bible is written
169811 the intent of the publisher was to design a religious sacred document to reflect an individual opinion or a groups conclusion to cause me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse discrimination episodes of hate and physical violence including murder
169812 this whole lawsuit is making a mockery of the holy bible and a blatant attempt by the homosexual community to away the rights of bible believing christians in the united states past cases against christians and their beliefs has shown that court actions infringing on their beliefs and practices is even easier than taking away candy from a baby
169813 my fear is that christians bishops pastors and church goers will silently accept the decision of a black robed lawyer who may or may not have his own religious agenda too often religious leaders have failed to motivate their churches to take action when their rights are being violated by oppressive anti religious forces inside and outside our government
169814 zondervan doesnt translate the bible or own the copyright for any of the translations instead our company relies on the scholarly judgment of credible translation committees
169815 has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of the plaintiffs claims
169816 this case just may go a lot further than it deserves thanks to a liberal judge who believes his word is sacrosanct
169817 were an international christian communications company with a heart for helping people find and follow jesus christ by inspiring them with relevant biblical and spiritual resources we do this through our best selling award winning and life changing products
169818 if people believe this lawsuit will disappear they are sadly mistaken judge cook is considered an activist judge who has a personal agenda when it comes to so called discrimination cases and the homosexual plaintiff against zondervan and thomas nelson is claiming the bible discriminates against gays and lesbians this case is not going away any time soon
169819 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it
169820 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
169821 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
169822 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
169823 this is where i got the idea to use decoupling as a way of integrating two programs
169824 i went over this in community college but that class only took it so far this teaches you about the three different specification conditions the things you put in documentation to let future programmers know how to use it in community college we covered only two of them
169825 i will be able to have my own house and a car
169826 this was probably the most widely discussed decision at mit
169827 they should give the nobel prize to whoever came up with that idea
169828 if i have a question or a problem i dont understand i can send an instant message to a teaching assistant or a lab assistant
169829 when im in a lecture i look around to see peoples faces i can see when theyre nodding off and change my approach even if there are 200 people in the room
169830 allowed me to write simpler code less code and be more efficient and more productive with my time
169831 i definitely want to get my bachelors degree thats my goal
169832 it is the best thing i have ever seen in computer science
169833 part of our stated mission is to be more than just a project at mit
169834 to evolve into a movement to help other universities develop a model
169835 a group of us here are considering opening a university devoted solely to e learning courses from mit
169836 our vision is to have this open source software on the site as well as information that helps people build a learning community whether its in namibia thailand wherever
169837 people start to get nervous if you talk about evolution
169838 at first i didnt want to use it it looked too advanced
169839 its like you want to hear the next word its such a rich experience that i would get done with one lecture and find myself clicking on the next one immediately
169840 first of all hes a great speaker he does demonstrations we never had that our class was all tedious derivations every day he impressed the heck out of me he relates it all to things you know look at these kids laughing they give him a standing ovation at the end of each lecture we never had a moment of levity in our class
169841 i do fine and feel great and then when i take my test the problems are easier
169842 theres a lot of satisfaction that comes from being able to understand the mit classes
169843 what does this mean for the utorrent community not much at least not at first the intention is to maintain the website as it is and keep the forums and community active
169844 q how will this impact the bittorrent open source development community as a whole
169845 008000 gt a there will be no impact to the bittorrent open source development community we are committed to maintaining the preeminent reference implementation of bittorrent under an open source license
169846 sorry source code for bittorrent 6 0 like the source code for utorrent will not be released however versions 5 and earlier were of course released under open source licenses and remain available for you to modify and redistribute subject to the terms of their respective licenses
169847 well always maintain an open source version although it may not necessarily reflect the latest client on the site
169848 there are two issues people need to come to grips with developers who produce open source products will often have their product repackaged and redistributed by businesses with malicious intent they repackage the software with spyware or charge for the product we often receive phone calls from people who complain they have paid for the bittorrent client
169849 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
169850 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
169851 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal

169909 while this mergers and acquisitions environment is encouraging for continued industry prosperity it poses challenges for firm owners in their attempts to understand and take advantage of the opportunities that arise the terms of the most successful transactions in any given situation are shaped by the characteristics of the individual firm and by the business and personal preferences of its owners
169910 never before has the independent registered investment advisory marketplace experienced such a high volume of transactions and had so many options for structuring deals the transaction environment we are experiencing is characterized by a rapidly rising level of market liquidity as a result firms can now grow and develop in ways that were previously unimaginable

169915 at explorer we not only value partnership we fundamentally understand that our success depends on the success of our agent partners

169917 working with insurance companies on branding can be quite challenging because carriers are understandably risk averse
169918 not explorer its unequivocal promise of profound partnership with independent agents gave us a tremendous foundation to help build the explorer brand in alignment with its business strategy and to develop a new logo and look that is elegant and engaging yet completely unexpected among peer institutions

169932 they put a lot of work in the weight room and they are fired up and ready to get started
169933 its great to see them doing the things we expect of them at the first practice
169934 its just a lot of change of pace from being in the weight room picking things up again
169935 but once we get flowing we feel no one can stop us
169936 two a days are awesome i think me and the other linemen were ready to hit already and its just the first practice
169937 our guys are antsy to do more than just shove at the pads

169956 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy

169958 significantly holding down earnings for the first half of the year
169959 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
