4960142 el reino de granada ser a uno de los mejores de espa a si no tuviese tantas monta as y si no careciese de gente para cultivarlo aparte de que all llueve tan raras veces que se ven obligados si no se quiere dejar que todo se pierda a regar por medio de un molino y de una m quina que eleve el agua de un pozo que hacen correr por los jardines aunque sin embargo hay comarcas por donde los r os pasan que son las f rtiles de espa a principalmente por el lado del mar en donde hay algunos buenos puertos como m laga que es una ciudad de tr fico por la cantidad de aceite de vino de frutas pasas que de all se secan todos los a os y que est fortificada por dos castillos el uno encima de la monta a y el otro a orillas del mar con un arsenal lleno de municiones y de armas de todas clases como tambi n almer a almu car y salobre a que es un puerto de mar
4960143 la amada so adora a los brazos del gal n
4960144 a la sombra de aquel d a giraban los deseos sobre nosotros como esferas astron micas de fidelidad lo pasamos en un jard n al que una nube armada con el acerado sable del rel mpago escanci la bebida de la madrugada el rojo vino nos dio como almohadas los macizos de murta y parec amos reyes sobre el trono de los verdes boscajes la mano del amor nos ensart para la alegr a nosotros ramos las perlas y los amores los hilos nos atacaban como lanzas los pechos de las doncellas movi ndonos guerra y para defendernos no vest amos otra cota que nuestras pieles de fanal antes nosotros se destapaban caras deliciosas que parec an lunas entre la noche de las trenzas
4960145 leyendo la descripci n po tica de ibn al hatib hace de m laga las comparaciones despu s muchas veces repetidas parecen flores artificiales ofrecidas a una juventud eterna
4960146 pues m laga lo que se dice de las perlas la impar y su campo el para so
4960147 la mano le est dando a la alcazaba hazen los dos murados maridajes quando uno y otro en permanente caba todo un monte guarnecen de omenajes que acaban adonde el cielo acaba sus almenas se tocan de celajes cuyas vistosa al tope pedrer a es con velas la luz de andaluc a
4960148 la alcazaba se asienta en el monte como en un trono y al la ha colocado en un lugar excelso sus muros y sus recintos son dobles su almenara se alza sobre la cima del bendito monte sus torres est n pr ximas unas de otras sus escaleras son altas y sus puertas bien defendidas
4960149 a mi derecha gritos y gritos a mi izquierda gritos entre mis ojos yo ando sobre gritos gritos de u as y garras gritos encanecidos abanicos de la luna en las noches c lidas silenciosas hu rfanas la tumba de mis huesos es hoy estanque de palomas me est s oyendo me est s oyendo me est s mirando me est s mirando
4960150 saliendo de la ciudad hacia el oriente hay un grande y poderosos castillo 25 de laber ntica disposici n con puertas de hierro desde que la parte del mar se disfruta de un admirable panorama tiene la fortaleza tres mazmorras cavadas en la misma roca como las de granada en donde encerraban a los cautivos cristianos present monos al alcalde quien habiendo le do las cartas que llevamos para l nos recibi cort smente y mand a dos servidores que nos ense asen la fortaleza alta 26 que est encima del monte y a la que se va por un camino que avanza entre dos muros esta parte del castillo es de una robustez maravillosa y desde all en los d as serenos se alcanza a ver tierra de berber a que dista no m s de 15 millas
4960151 aldrete en su origen y principios de la lengua castellana dice textualmente hay una torre en m laga que ella misma contra el tiempo y cautiverio de moros se ha conservado en la fortaleza que hoy llama gibelpharo o como pronuncia el vulgo gibralfaro siendo puesto el gibel de los moros al monte donde estaba la torre y dejando el nombre antiguo de pharo que all hab a
4960152 es decir aldrete adopta la interpretaci n etimol gica de nombre compuesto de ra z rabe y griega
4960153 despu s de estos restos de la alcazaba merece ser visitado otro monumento musulm n m s qu podr ver ya de sus antiguos constructores sino un magn fico arco de herradura sobre un ancho murall n coronado de peque as troneras y viejos matacanes est el arco encerrado en un cuadro bell simo y sencillo tiene almohadillado el paramento lleva en sus enjutas dos escudos con leyendas andalus es manifiesta en todas sus partes delicadeza y gusto m s est ya enteramente aislado afeado por una puerta cuadrada y baja desfigurado por una ventana con reja de hierro abierta en el centro de su espaciosa rea y toda su riqueza y hermosura no pueden ya servir m s que para hacernos sentir la p rdida del edificio a que form parte ya no existen queda s lo en su lugar un parque de artiller a que en nada revela ya la mano del artista
4960154 tomada la ciudad de m laga por los reyes cat licos repartieron tierras en uno de los arrabales a garci l pez de arriar n caballero vizca no que asisti en la empresa y de quien llevaron el nombre llam ronse islas porque islas se llamaban las manzanas de casas y hab a m s de una en el dicho terreno
4960155 tambi n es peculiar de esta ciudad un vino delicioso tanto l cito como il cito hasta el punto de que se ha dado proverbial el vino de m laga
4960156 oh se or de todo lo que hay en el para so no te pido m s que vino de m laga y pasas de sevilla
4960157 salud oh m laga qu higos produces por tu causa los nav os van de ellos cargados
4960158 mi m dico hab ame prohibido tu estancia en raz n de mi enfermedad pero mi m dico no posee equivalente de mi vida
4960159 el juez de la reuni n de los fieles abu abdallah hijo de abdelmalik ha a adido al d stico citado como ap ndice a esos versos empleando tambi n la figura llamada paronomasia
4960160 e huns no olvidar s sus higos aparte de ellos te acordar s de sus aceitunas
4960161 las tropas rusas han comenzado a retirarse y las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz est n comenzando a llegar
4960162 qu vieron ustedes en la carretera a gori una columna de fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz
4960163 todas las rutas est n abiertas a la ayuda humanitaria y a los georgianos
4960164 no hay ning n signo de que los rusos est n planificando su retirada por el contrario multiplican los retenes y fortifican sus posiciones

4960194 every gross brained idiot is suffered to come into print
4960195 women do not find it difficult nowadays to behave like men but they often find it extremely difficult to behave like gentlemen
4960196 its like watching that gravy train roll right off a cliff isnt it
4960197 this encore presentation of prime time olympics is brought to you by ambien
4960198 wenn ich wollte k nnte ich morgen das angebot von lafontaine annehmen und mich zum kanzler w hlen lassen
4960199 seine verdienste um das zusammenwachsen von ost und west im wiedervereinten deutschland
4960200 der sich als anwalt der b rgerinnen und b rger in ganz deutschland versteht der in politischen grundsatzfragen couragiert position bezieht und sich dabei nicht scheut auch einmal auf konfliktkurs mit den parteien zu gehen
4960201 we are in the preliminary stages of looking at possible retail opportunities
4960202 im excited to be able through aosmi to reach out to members of active adult communities and share what ive learned i strongly believe that by using a combination of aerobic exercise good nutrition flexibility and weight training anyone can live a healthier life no matter what their age
4960203 man sollte vielleicht jetzt schon damit anfangen sich an solche tabellenst nde zu gew hnen
4960204 x isnt working but i could do this if i wanted and that would probably fix it
4960205 there are no hipaa cops out there looking for violations
4960206 enforcement at the office for civil rights is virtually nonexistent
4960207 technically theyve still not issued a single fine not even down to the 100 level and they could toss those around like candy if only to wake people up about the seriousness of compliance
4960208 ocr has investigated complaints against many different types of entities including national pharmacy chains major medical centers group health plans hospital chains and small provider offices
4960209 she told this information to a lot of people in town and the news got around
4960210 enforcement is left to the health care community to sort of self police itself and to the office of civil rights which has done virtually nothing
4960211 we have found that this is the most effective way to obtain industry compliance with the privacy rule
4960212 that took away your ability as a patient to control access to your information
4960213 so now there is no real privacy right to be violated
4960214 the privacy provisions of hipaa are serious and have significant consequences if they are violated
4960215 long gone are the days when medical employees were able to snoop around office files for juicy information to share outside the office
4960216 the ceo made the decision to give her a very stiff warning that said never again would this be tolerated
4960217 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
4960218 just because im an employee doesnt mean that you as my supervisor can look at that information
4960219 i dont think thats prosecutable because of the way hipaa was gutted after it was approved
4960220 its hard times this countrys in a depression and moneys scarce right now im unemployed just got out of the military this saves money out of my pocket
4960221 were living in tough economic times now so this is a great opportunity to actually give back to the community here in west fresno
4960222 you know education is extremely important its a valuable tool for the members of this community and we just want to make sure our children are ready on that first day of school
4960223 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4960224 i felt the closest thing to depression that i have ever felt in my life
4960225 do you think its ok to write about the prophets sex life
4960226 another example of a quiet wave of self censorship and cultural cowardice sweeping western art circles
4960227 this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community
4960228 at the same time the muslims want to kill me im pandering to them
4960229 when people talk about an offended muslim being the same as a violent muslim to me that sounds like racism
4960230 what a pistol she seemed like someone i would want to know
4960231 scandal blew in on the errant wind when i rode into medina clutching safwans waist my neighbors rushed into the street what they saw my wrapper fallen to my shoulders unheeded loose hair lashing my face the wife of gods prophet entwined around another man
4960232 like our first book all over again our first art book
4960233 there are stories here stories down every hallway in every bedroom in the old kitchen stories both universal and particular and peculiar to individuals testimonials to personality many can never be known never be read or understood beyond the mild comprehension of lives passed of lives past
4960234 a lot of times it would just be in the late summer evenings after weve had dinner we would go for a drive and do maybe one or two shots and it was just to record what we saw around us
4960235 we werent planning that it would be a book or even an art project it was just boy that barn looks like its going to fall down
4960236 if the camera is on a tripod theres a lot of thought and planning that goes into a shot
4960237 60 or 70 or 80 percent of the whole process could be thinking about it
4960238 youre constantly looking at the sky were very aware of that in that the weather becomes another element of the pictures another dimension that were trying to capture
4960239 its not really about nostalgia or romance of the past at all
4960240 i was really drawn to the book because even as a child for some reason i always loved old barns
4960241 theyre awe inspiring even though theyre in black and white theyre not painted but theyre still here theyre still here theyve endured weather and neglect and theyre hanging in there
4960242 i dont think the book necessarily represents schoharie county because schoharie county is really very vital and alive
4960243 but i think it represents actually the heritage of the county
4960244 the photographs help you to tie the past with the present so that no matter what happens in the future this is still a part of the heritage here whether the farming community or the country store in gallupville i mean i still shop there and that was there when i was a kid and im 64 years old
4960245 yesterday the breeze was very light and i couldnt give the us guy any chance to get away from me
4960246 today i was more confident with my speed against his and my fitness
4960247 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and that is something i learned and something that helped me
4960248 it is been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4960249 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4960250 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4960251 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough
4960252 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg
4960253 i was going to get to the finish line no matter what because that was my race
4960254 in the golden bar they have golden chairs golden glasses golden beer and a golden urinal
4960255 hows that different from any other area on our team
4960256 its not just the bullpen look at our first two guys off the bench last night rookie outfielders brian barton and joe mather
4960257 they havent done a real good job of centering the ball on him
4960258 he went down there to improve his breaking ball friday he strikes out encarnacion with a breaking ball
4960259 and you know what that guy has hit breaking balls in the strike zone for big damage i was scared to death
4960260 you sent him out there and hes got a look you say hey give him a little more what i dont think you do is anoint those guys
4960261 where have all the pundits gone since hillary dropped out of the race
4960262 meine schwester anna verlangte f r die wiener wohnung pl tzlich mehr geld da die medikamente f r ihren mann johann so teuer w ren es kam zu streitereien und sie stellte mich als kindersch nder hin ich habe meinen drei t chtern nie etwas getan vor einem jahr sagte ich zu anna dass sie f r alles b en wird ich habe den entschluss gefasst dass ich sie und ihren mann johann umbringen werde
4960263 die waffe habe ich vor 20 jahren von meinem bruder franz f r 5 000 schilling gekauft im jahr 2004 habe ich sie in einem waldst ck bei g nserndorf s d vergraben im april habe ich sie wieder ausgegraben als ich im mai erfahren habe dass auch mein bruder franz und seine frau viera herumerz hlten dass ich ein kindersch nder sei war f r mich klar dass ich auch die beiden ermorden werde ich plante die morde f r den 1 juli 2008 einen tag nachdem ich die wiener wohnung r umen musste einige tage zuvor habe ich 3 000 euro behoben und zu hause hatte ich noch barmittel von rund 3 000 euro drei monate zuvor hatte ich eine art testament in den tresor meiner tochter gelegt
4960264 am 1 juli bin ich um 5 30 uhr aufgestanden und mit der schnellbahn nach strasshof zum haus meiner schwester gefahren ich schlich mich dann zu johann in den garten und sagte zu ihm der kindersch nder ist da ich bedrohte ihn mit der waffe als er hinfiel habe ich ihm zweimal in die brust geschossen dann ging ich in den keller wo meine schwester war ich sagte zu ihr dass ich ihr die schl ssel f r die wohnung geben wolle dann richtete ich die pistole auf sie ich hab dann zweimal abgedr ckt und ihr in die brust geschossen
4960265 danach bin ich mit dem rad weiter zum wohnhaus meines bruders franz kurz vor 10 uhr ging ich dort durch die kellert re ins haus im stiegenhaus wartete ich bis die frau meines bruders viera nach haus gekommen ist dann sagte ich zu ihr der kindersch nder ist da ich drohte ihr mit der pistole viera versuchte nach der waffe zu greifen dadurch hat sich ein schuss gel st der sie aber nicht getroffen hat ich dr ngte viera in den keller und sie sagte mir dass sie nichts gemacht habe zu diesem zeitpunkt hatte ich nicht vor dass ich sie erschie en werde wir gingen in den heizraum und sie setzte sich nieder sie sagte nochmals dass sie nichts gemacht habe und daraufhin habe ich auch auf sie zweimal geschossen ich wollte auf franz warten und blieb deshalb bis 14 uhr nachdem es mir zu lange dauerte nahm ich einen werbeprospekt und schrieb darauf du bist der n chste als ich schon gehen wollte h rte ich das auto von franz er kam durch den keller und schrie nach seiner frau als er mich gesehen hat habe ich zu ihm gesagt der kindersch nder ist da ich drohte mit der waffe und er konnte in die k che fl chten ich schoss dann f nf bis sechsmal in die k che worauf franz herauskam und vor mir hinfiel daraufhin habe ich ihm einmal in den kopf geschossen
4960266 dann fuhr ich mit dem fahrrad zum bahnhof ich habe dann zwei bereits vor einer woche zuvor verfasste briefe in den postkasten geworfen bei einem brief handelt es sich um ein drohschreiben an andreas den sohn meines bruders franz und seiner gattin viera darin schrieb ich dass andi die exekutionszahlungen meines anderen bruders johann einstellen solle und als wiedergutmachung ihm einen betrag von 100 000 euro zahlen solle ich schrieb weiters dass er auch dran sein werde wenn er meine forderung nicht befolge und dass ich ihm dann jemand schicken werde die drohung war aber nicht ernst gemeint weil an dreas wie mein eigenes kind f r mich war mein bruder johann hat sich n mlich in den 70er jahren einmal geld von unserem bruder franz ausgeborgt als er es nicht zur ckzahlen konnte zog franz vor gericht meiner meinung nach h tte man das auch ohne gericht regeln k nnen im zweiten brief habe ich johann geschrieben dass er wenn er die 100 000 euro erh lt die h lfte an meine t chter berweisen m chte gleichzeitig habe ich ihm eine sim karte f r ein handy bermittelt ich habe aber nie angerufen weil ich wusste dass ich dann von der polizei schneller gefunden werde w rde
4960267 dann bin ich mit dem zug nach bratislava die pistole nahm ich zur sicherheit mit ich hatte vor mich einer eventuellen festnahme durch einen selbstmord zu entziehen
4960268 ich kann mir das erneute blackout nicht erkl ren doch drei medaillen in der familie sind auch okay
4960269 ich beginne mit dem zielen auf 12 uhr ber der scheibe und gehe dann langsam nach unten dabei ist der schuss irrt mlich und etwas zu fr h losgegangen
4960270 so verr ckte sachen passieren eben der schuss ist irrt mlich losgegangen mehr ist dazu nicht zu sagen

4960278 jennifer is de slimste meest intellectuele vrouw die ik ooit heb ontmoet
4960279 ik heb de relatie be indigd om alleen te kunnen zijn ik ga niet haar tijd verspillen als iets niet goed voelt
4960280 ik blijf bij mijn standpunt dat de belgische vlag hier geen plaats meer heeft
4960281 de federale staat belgi heeft voor vlaanderen geen toegevoegde waarde meer en moet plaats maken voor een confederatie ik doe ook niets verkeerd er is geen enkele wet die mij verplicht de belgische vlag te laten wapperen er is wel een omzendbrief maar als anderen de grondwet weigeren na te leven waarom zou ik dan een omzendbrief wel naleven
4960282 dat is een ludieke actie waar niemand kwaad mee gedaan wordt ik heb het veel moeilijker met een aantal andere zaken zoals het feit dat in lennik een aantal straatnamen overschilderd is door hakenkruisen of dat men mij mails stuurt waarin ik vergeleken word met hitler blijkbaar mag je als vlaming niet meer opkomen voor je identiteit zonder een racist of een nazi te zijn de franstaligen hebben de mond vol over verdraagzaamheid als het hen uitkomt maar raak aan hun voorrechten in vlaams brabant en ze vergeten wat dat woord betekent

4960295 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4960296 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4960297 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4960298 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4960299 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4960300 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4960301 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4960302 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4960303 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4960304 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4960305 in 1985 there were 14 500 banks in the u s and now theres 7 200
4960306 for the past 23 years six of them went away each week the big universal banks might get hit but they stay in business and come out with a bigger share of the market than they had before
4960307 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4960308 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4960309 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4960310 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4960311 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4960312 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4960313 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
4960314 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
4960315 the steps are only about two feet wide and you spiral your way down a bell tower to get out
4960316 it was just impossible to bring her out any other way than the way we did
4960317 best health care possible to the soldiers and their families will be provided
4960318 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4960319 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4960320 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4960321 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4960322 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4960323 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4960324 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4960325 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4960326 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4960327 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4960328 to be at the top of so many great athletes its a pretty amazing thing
4960329 my goggles pretty much filled with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
4960330 but its fine i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
4960331 i had a pretty good idea we could break seven minutes
4960332 it feels good to be the first ones to do it
4960333 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4960334 iran hopes to make a good use of its advantages in geopolitics energy and religion to expand relations with all sides and build up anti u s strength
4960335 irans diplomatic efforts have achieved some results which partly dispelled pressures from the united states
4960336 but due to geopolitical historical and religious reasons and irans hard line stance on the nuclear issue its diplomatic efforts are still confronted with challenges
4960337 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
4960338 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4960339 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia
4960340 but i heard the deal was on the table for a while
4960341 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
4960342 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
4960343 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
4960344 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4960345 danny ferry has been one of the most vilified figures in cleveland sports through the last 5 years
4960346 lebrons gonna go to ny lebrons going to go to europe etc
4960347 pro evolution soccer is our favourite when not in training and i reckon i could easily get a job as a commentator as mine is unbelievable on one particular time when me and fletcher annihilated rooney and wezza we held a mock press conference and made them explain the problems between the two and to justify their poor performance while i filmed it on my mobile
4960348 in todays and yesterdays clashes at least 23 people have been killed on both sides and 28 others were injured
4960349 a scotland wide show broadcast from radio clyde where we have our most developed technology will be better able to attract big name celebrities and that is what we feel the audience want that is the reason we are doing this
4960350 the patient is deceased and the search has now been called off
4960351 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is

4960356 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
4960357 so you were born and that was a good day someday youll die and that is a shame but somewhere in the between theres a life of which we all dream and nothing and no one can ever take that away
4960358 dont worry insight will come but i dont think it will be during the meditation
4960359 well i cant see how that was relevant to what i was asking

4960398 there are a lot of county cricketers and ex pros who play there are a lot of experienced cricketers
4960399 one thing that sticks out for me is the hunger and the intensity county cricket can sometimes be the same thing every day here everyone wants to win they have aims
4960400 for me its a very good level and there are things i can learn and take back to england and the county championship with warwickshire
4960401 whoever you are you want to be playing test cricket and to do that you have to be playing for england ill be sitting there wanting to beat them but at the same time thinking in a few years i want to be there
4960402 obviously you still love your roots but you want to be playing international cricket earning the money whatever motivates the person
4960403 but you want to be on the other side youre still proud of playing for scotland but theres a bigger picture

4960430 stuttgart hat eines der spielst rksten teams der liga ich rechne damit dass der vfb am ende der saison unter den ersten f nf stehen wird
4960431 they have a really excellent pitching staff but lackey is the no 1 guy who has to step up in the playoffs hes pitched really well gotten over the boston hump its heading toward a good conclusion for the angels
4960432 hell make the adjustments of not having manny around if hes healthy but against top teams with good pitching hes not going to get much to hit though the beneficiary of that is kevin youkilis if he continues to take advantage and produces like he can he might be the mvp of the league
4960433 you have to have his experience and leadership down the stretch what he does is create a confidence among the starting pitchers that if they do their part hell do his
4960434 if this guy gets on a roll hes one of those guys who gets everyone else to ride his coattails
4960435 this is a good baseball team that needs a closer they can depend on woods got to be that guy at crunch time well see
4960436 not the hitter i would have chosen to bring an offense together but will he contribute with a big home run drive in a big run now and then sure the dodgers added the best hitter no doubt about that
4960437 you just have to cross your fingers and hope hes on a good roll down the stretch and heading into the postseason if hes the guy who has blown seven saves and loses it from time to time the mets wont have a shot
4960438 with tom gordon out theres more need for lidge to be the guy he was in the first half of the season did they burn him out that would be devastating for the phillies
4960439 its too bad the brewers werent in a position to allow sabathia to skip a start that would really help keep him strong but they dont have that luxury
4960440 theres still time weve had some interest in our players but nothing has materialized quite yet but between now and the roster deadline aug 31 theres still plenty of time for teams to assess their needs and come back to us with something
4960441 its a transitional time but an exciting time wed like to see what these kids can do now and how we project them for our team in the future theres been some frustration this year we felt we did some things better than we expected and we didnt do things that we expected to do we havent hit at times and that puts a strain on your pitching staff
4960442 in his defense hes gone out there at times and had good stuff and we havent supported him offensively same with matt cain i think its awfully tough mentally for a pitcher to know hes got to be perfect out there and not make a mistake because we arent going to score enough runs to support him barry is transitioning theres no doubt about that he keeps searching for something to turn it around for him again and believe me hes trying
4960443 i think we made a great choice in going after aaron rowand last year i think hes been everything as advertised for us and hes someone we would certainly want to build our team around in terms of a guy who leaves everything he has on the field every day we have some things we need to correct and well look for free agents and to make deals we need to do something about our bullpen we need maybe to look and see if we can do something with a first baseman we know we have a keeper in fred lewis well certainly have to wait and see whos on our team by the end of the year and make our evaluations and who we have and who we dont have
4960444 i was on the subcommittee that was discussing it at the time
4960445 i think we all just want to see a home run ball called fairly and given the new boundaries of some of the new ballparks its getting harder for umpires to distinguish the boundaries in some of the stadiums
4960446 i dont think we want to be at the ballpark all night the only thing that bothers anyone is when a ball is called fair or foul and it should have been the other way those things can be looked at quickly without major disruption to the game
4960447 you know i have a manager who is a little eccentric
4960448 the more we get into it the more we see that this issue has far greater depth than we ever anticipated theres a lot to this that we keep finding out and keep discussing its going to take a while to sort this out and come up with a solution we certainly dont want fans or players to get hurt
4960449 they want you to take on their contracts and give you prospects its one or the other and they want both

4960572 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4960573 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4960574 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time

4960728 i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt
4960729 you shall know this day and understand it in your heart that the almighty is god
4960730 when you stood at mount sinai god asked who will insure that you will always fear god you should have replied almighty you will you should have seized the opportunity to request that god give you fear of heaven
4960731 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
4960732 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction
4960733 if one person does a sincere teshuva return to god then the whole world merits forgiveness

4960744 that too is quite complex there are many factors involved including season of the year time of day type of fish water depth temperature and speed of the current
4960745 you will testify that you didnt study torah because youre just a simple man not endowed with any talent or intelligence but do you think he gave you the brains to be a fisherman but not the brains to learn torah

4960751 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4960752 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4960753 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature

4960758 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4960759 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions

4960807 if youre selling a home in this market you have to realize that youre probably not making the appreciation you would have three years ago and youre going to have to work a lot harder to get your home sold
4960808 you can still do well if you do everything you can to make your house look impeccable
4960809 in the old days you could have afforded to have your home appeal to one out of every five buyers
4960810 but with the limited number of buyers out there the key is to make the house appeal to 10 out of 10 people who walk through
4960811 its one of the easiest things you can do and its one of the first things people notice
4960812 if the home is clean it shows that everything has been well maintained
4960813 you have to consider that anyone buying a home in the 300 000 range or above is also looking at new construction which today comes with all the upgrades
4960814 but if they can theyll go for something bigger like an older home that is just as nice
4960815 the homes that sell in this market are the ones with the most features or the ones that are priced the least
4960816 so you have to ask yourself am i going to keep reducing the price or keep adding features until someone finds it irresistible
4960817 i represent a lot of buyers and one of the things they always look at are the photos of people and thats what they remember
4960818 so when i list a home im very strict about having no family photos out you want the buyers to spend their time looking at the home and thinking about how their furniture would look in it or how their photos would look on the walls
4960819 ninety six percent of buyers start their search on the internet and thats how they determine what homes theyre going to see
4960820 you also really have to look at the competition and see whats available in the price range youre listing at and how your home compares to the others
4960821 better than the competition in the eyes of nine out of 10 people

4960864 the un human rights council in geneva and the un general assembly
4960865 muslim countries have won a battle to prevent islam from being criticized during debates by the un human rights council
4960866 this council is not prepared to discuss religious matters in depth consequently we should not do it
4960867 while costeas ban applies to all religions it was prompted by muslim countries complaining about references to islam
4960868 the united nations general assembly adopted similar resolutions against the defamation of islam
4960869 with the aim of playing a more active role in engaging american policy makers
4960870 and in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna
4960871 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed
4960872 as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked

4960875 but the advantage upwind makes up for the disadvantage downwind
4960876 in qingdao the current has a big effect on the race course we already know quite accurately what the current will be and with the predominant wind from the south east it means that in terms of percentage the upwind leg will take a lot longer than on a normal course without current the lighter the wind gets the bigger the change in percentage upwind downwind will be
4960877 but if the wind comes from the opposite direction then the numbers will reverse and we might reconsider our strategy

4960882 i had a game plan that i had discussed with my coach jez fanstone to have a bit of a match race with florent in the pre start and to try to put him off his game plan
4960883 this does rank amongst one of my more satisfying victories it is always nice to win when you have been behind going into the last race
4960884 it was frustrating not being able to speak out directly in the council meeting as i left feeling there was more to say in the debate but a lot of the sailors views were voiced through certain council members
4960885 the isaf executive committee had put forward a submission to give council the opportunity to consider again their decision from november 2007 on the selection of events for 2012 a submission which demonstrates the democracy of isaf and the flexibility and open mindedness the organization has in ensuring the interests of the sport prevail
4960886 concern was also expressed at the level of negative personal attacks made against isaf and isaf council members in publications blogs and websites since the decision taken in november 2007
4960887 em vista da determina o americana de montar um sistema antim sseis na europa os militares russos est o revisando todos seus planos para responder washington adequadamente
4960888 that council reaffirm their decision on the 2012 olympic events made in november
4960889 should council vote not to reaffirm the decision two separate votes will then follow 1 should the selected events for the men be changed a majority of two thirds will be required to effect any change as per regulation 16 1 3 a 2 should the selected events for the women be changed a majority of two thirds will be required to effect any change as per regulation 16 1 3 a
4960890 the multihull community must now focus on reinstatement for 2016
4960891 standing by their decision of november 2007 the council gave a clear message to support the events as already approved
4960892 it was disappointing not being able to make the case for competeing athletes
4960893 isaf is very shaken by the level of personal attacks that individuals have come under over the past few months and they didnt want to put me in a similar situation
4960894 i spoke to many committee members and really felt i was getting the athletes point across what i think is being missed here is how these decisions have such a massive impact on sailors lives the problem with the multihull being thrown out of the games is that the skills to multihull sailing are so unique its not going to be that easy for people to step cross into other events and continue their careers my fear is were going to lose a lot of these sailors from olympic sailing
4960895 but to suggest that they would jump onto a monohull well i guess you would have had to have some experience sailing both i have to know that this probably is not a viable solution
4960896 the most interesting observation is to see how many mnas are now saying that their delegates were instructed to vote in the best interest of their specific country winning medals not in the best interest of our beloved sport surprise surprise holier than thou pontifications are quite hollow methinks
4960897 weight category events should not be allowed except for the combat sports and for weightlifting
4960898 the keelboat class are very expensive boats for general practice and development compared to other classes
4960899 if the executive board recommends the reduction in the number of athletes and events the commission believes these reductions could be made through the exclusion of keelboat sailing events
4960900 at the council meeting on 9 november and prior to making the decision on the ten events for the 2012 olympic programme the isaf president was explicitly asked by a council member if there was any ioc guidance which may affect the choice of events the isaf president responded that the ioc guidance was to achieve universality nation participation medal spread and media appeal be assured that if there had been any specific ioc guidance which was new to the table you would all have been advised in advance
4960901 very high reliance on olympic revenues 65 and a low percentage of its income comes from marketing and broadcasting 10

4960904 its been an overwhelming process to choose this team the human element is crucial to the final outcome we didnt take it lightly
4960905 with the americas cup in flux right now there is a lot of really good sailors looking for work what i thought was going to be a difficult process became overwhelming we had resum s from 400 sailors crazy enough to want to do this race with that group of resum s you could have put 10 world class crews together and not miss much
4960906 very international six different nationalities on board experience played a part in their selection if there were two individuals who were close in terms of their resum s then i leaned towards experience particularly volvo ocean race experience
4960907 sailing skill was the first element chemistry was the second thing i didnt want to go sailing around the world with someone i didnt like sounds silly but its important then the experience factor when we had two choices to make we went with experience youll find in this list a lot of people who are successful sailing around the world
4960908 these boats are clearly people breakers reference back to our rambler experience we have a bunch of guys who are saying let me in coach these guys are literally a phone call away they know who they are and they understand that if a particular skill set goes down on board then we will be calling them there is a certain amount you are allowed to rotate crew from leg to leg
4960909 weve talked about chemistry and winning is the best way to promote chemistry winning cures a lot of ailments

4960911 i am very lucky because it is an owners class with pro sailors steering the match and russell let me steer his boat
4960912 i think that this is an amazing accomplishment and i am very proud of what we have done
4960913 we are very happy to finish the event in second it was absolutely superb i am very impressed by larry ellisons performance he sailed extremely well its his first time on this boat with this team and the level of the fleet is just huge what hes done is amazing
4960914 its just been one of those weeks where its all been decided with a throw of the dice and weve thrown a lot of ones and not many sixes
4960915 i know it is easy to come up with excuses but it has been one of those weeks where if it is going to happen it is going to happen to us and with such big fleets at the star worlds any mistake costs you dear in that sense the racing here is really kind of irrelevant to the racing were going to be experiencing at the games where its just 15 other boats and its not so costly if you miss a windshift
4960916 the olympics needs the star boat more than the star boat needs the olympics
4960917 in our poll we assumed that the majority voted not to reaffirm the decision so we then voted on whether the selected events for the men and women needed to be changed the yes no target was two thirds or 66 67 by the end of the vote this is how the buttheads felt regarding the following events that had been selected in november 2007 for the 2012 olympics
4960918 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
4960919 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
4960920 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
4960921 they get hit by cars they run into power lines they get shot they eat things they shouldnt eat that have poison on them one of the compelling factors is that most of those things have something to do with us
4960922 perhaps we will make changes in our lives to better protect the birds
4960923 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
4960924 they wont take my fuel surcharge till they pry it from my cold dead hand
4960925 because fuel prices have been so highly volatile we elected to implement the fuel supplement as a separate charge so we would be in a position to promptly and effectively make adjustments to the amount based on the potential for ongoing changes to fuel prices
4960926 you should expect that fuel supplements are going to be around at least for a while
4960927 at this time we have no plans to eliminate the surcharge
4960928 weve chosen to use the supplement because it specifically highlights that issue for our guests

4961060 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature

4961092 safiyah tuo padre ha sempre mantenuto inimicizia con me sino a che allah ha preso la sua decisione
4961093 il profeta le ha dato la scelta di unirsi alla sua gente una volta liberi o acettare lislam e unirsi in matrimonio con lui
4961094 quando safiyah si sposata era molto giovane e secondo ci che stato riportato aveva non pi di diciassette anni ed era estremamente bella
4961095 hai detto una cosa che se fosse stata lasciata nel mare si sarebbe macchiata con esso sporcando lacqua
4961096 quindi safiyah si convinta della verit del profeta non ha risparmiata alcuna fatica nel prendersi cura di lui e provvedere con qualsiasi conforto potesse venirle in mente questo stato evidente sin da quando giunta al cospetto di muhammad dopo la caduta di khaibar
4961097 il profeta ha provato del risentimento nei suoi confronti quando si rifiutata di entrare in intimit con lui nel viaggio precedente

4961101 o profeta di allah tu hai dato safiya bint huyai a dihya e lei la donna del capo della trib dei quraiza e an nadir quindi appartiene solo a te
4961102 o abu hamza quanto ha pagato il profeta come mahr per averla liberata e sposata
4961103 la sua persona stata il suo mahr in quanto lui lha liberata e sposata
4961104 mentre tornavamo um sulaim lha vestita per la cerimonia di nozze e durante la notte lha mandata come sposa al profeta

4961151 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4961152 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4961153 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4961154 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4961155 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4961156 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4961157 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4961158 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4961159 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4961160 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4961161 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4961162 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4961163 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4961164 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4961165 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4961166 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4961167 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4961168 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4961169 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4961170 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4961171 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4961172 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4961173 you could tell these workers wanted help but they were so scared and beat down by this company
4961174 contend with treatment and conditions that violate their human rights
4961175 they have a pattern that featured in this case parking by the head start center in a latino neighborhood as parents dropped off or picked up their kids
4961176 they followed school buses full of 5 year olds and they tailed immigrant head start staffers
4961177 children wonder whether they will see their arrested parent or parents even children of u s citizens are having nightmares about their own parents being taken away from them and they are creating drawings with the words dont take my friends away
4961178 the picture will tell you who and of course this is just to tell our former pm enough lah

4961180 com ajuda de deus pude sair desse purgat rio e esta medalha dedico a meu pa s
4961181 we played against boca one of the biggest teams in the world the team continue to show their effort and this is a good sign
4961182 sometimes we will lose but even so if we continue fighting until the referee blows his whistle we will be a good team
4961183 i am very satisfied with the performance of the team the players are very good they believe in themselves and they need to maintain this
4961184 in sport winning is everything the first step to building something is not to give up
4961185 pep has said that he guarantees the team will fight which they showed here right until the end
4961186 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
4961187 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
4961188 you feel terry will give 100 whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
4961189 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 in his game by being captain
4961190 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays
4961191 he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
4961192 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
4961193 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia
4961194 this time lets not be intimidated by the opposition and play two strikers
4961195 for that to work in qualification it has to be tried against the czechs
4961196 if wayne rooney is still not 100 because of his virus maybe peter crouch and jermain defoe should be given a chance as club mates at portsmouth
4961197 unfortunately it looks like dede has picked up a serious injury and that means the game falls into the background for me and makes it hard to talk about
4961198 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
4961199 this win gives us some momentum and self confidence but i will not be looking at the league table until after 10 matches
4961200 we have latched on to the good performances we showed in the second half of last season and in pre season
4961201 we did not show our true face and played very badly
4961202 we did not fight were not aggressive and failed to move that was pathetic

4961222 forgetting is sometimes the first step on the path of truth
4961223 there is a man called richard spoor who has divided the community
4961224 he is a white person today spoor says he is fighting for peoples rights but where was he when joe slovo former south african communist party leader was fighting for peoples rights and was imprisoned for that
4961225 i ask myself how much does he get for dividing our community
4961226 the fact that white people might be involved in providing assistance information and legal advice should not detract from the problem we have to deal with that they maintain they have not been adequately consulted about the impact of the mining and decisions to allow it
4961227 we lost st lucia us as the government we gave it up but what is happening in st lucia today
4961228 it has been declared an exclusive area and only rich white people go there
4961229 why do we need permission to mine natural resources why do we have to wait for people to teach us about nature they come here to play while we are hungry
4961230 if anything goes wrong at xolobeni the government will have to answer for it
4961231 we are going to mine in this area at kwanyana i will give you a chance to ask questions but one thing is sure we are going to mine
4961232 we asked how many fatalities would need to occur before the ethekwini transport authority addressed the issue
4961233 there has been an increase in traffic from the ports truck drivers getting impatient or wanting to avoid the weighbridge make use of bluff road because of the accident we realised the problem was bigger than we thought
4961234 there may have been fewer trucks but they still use the road i was booked off sick but pulled one of the trucks off the road
4961235 we have tried all routes public meetings petitions now it is time for people to have their say
4961236 sibande would be turning in his grave if he heard we were spending r22 million on a play and r9 million on a statue in his name
4961237 this money should be used for building clinics not splurging on unnecessary expenditure which brings sibandes name into disrepute
4961238 the total projected budget will be used for auditions rehearsals transport marketing and publicity accommodation of the cast production of the musical dvd and cds costumes and professional lighting the second phase is estimated at r11 million
4961239 i wont defend myself i am not qualified to defend myself or the government we applied for a tender and we got it but that the extent of the expenditure is an issue that is beyond me
4961240 they have a right to talk about sarafina 2 the question is who was wrong judge willem heath said i was not wrong
4961241 its a few individuals who are going to confuse issues they are trying to raise issues about money it is a shame they think mpumalanga doesnt deserve this play these are not anc members they are troublemakers
4961242 zelf zou ik eerder denken aan maximaal duizend dames en enkele heren maar ik reken vrouwen zonder muts zoals je die in volendam veel ziet niet mee dat is geen klederdracht meer ik zou liever zien dat het er meer waren ik vind het zonde dat de drachten verdwijnen
4961243 ook de jongste dame in staphorst zal het niet tot haar dood volhouden
4961244 de jongste mutsenmaaksters zijn daar nu rond de 60 misschien zingen ze het nog twintig jaar uit die mutsen zijn lastig te maken en als niemand het meer kan zal de dracht snel verdwijnen
4961245 je doet er niets tegen ik vind het erger dat er in nederland geen waardering is voor dit cultureel erfgoed
4961246 maar de meesten zitten al in een bejaardentehuis je ziet er hier nog hoogstens drie op straat
4961247 hoeveel tien twintig per plaats ze zijn er nog wel hoor je ziet ze nog steeds maar vooral in bejaardentehuizen
4961248 welnee enkel als ik een schone muts opdoe houdt dat wat op bij het aankleden want die moet ik dan opnieuw inspelden en ook als ik een nieuwe omslagdoek pak moet die ingespeld worden maar verder kleed ik me s ochtends net zo snel aan als iedere andere vrouw

4961254 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
4961255 one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches
4961256 i think he has been a little bit too willing or eager to give an administration whether mine or george bushs more power than the constitution originally intended
4961257 it worked a lot better than a lot of people anticipated
4961258 i am absolutely convinced that we have to have work as the centerpiece of any social policy
4961259 mr obama too has made millions from his books mr warren reached across the desk and gave mr obama a high five
4961260 im not suggesting that everybody making more than 250 000 a year is living on easy street
4961261 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4961262 this nomination should be based on the critera on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4961263 for me as a christian it is also a sacred union gods in the mix
4961264 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is
4961265 i know there are some here in cal eee fornia that disagree with that position
4961266 leadership involves far more than promoting programs and making speeches and since no one can predict what crises will happen over the next four years it is vital to know the decision capacity and process of each man

4961283 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4961284 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4961285 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4961286 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4961287 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4961288 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4961289 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4961290 when i trained oscar he was having trouble pulling the trigger and hes a little bit slow if stevie forbes can hit him as easily as he did i know pacquiao will knock him out
4961291 we need a long training camp just to work on the styles of how to beat him because hes a bigger guy be he does have trouble pulling the trigger now

4961294 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4961295 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4961296 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4961297 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4961298 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4961299 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4961300 this was clearly a case of attempted murder we could have been dealing with multiple casualties this sunday morning and the devastation that would have caused throughout the community

4961302 i am so proud and honoured to be representing zimbabwe here everyone back home was so excited and so supportive of me coming into my race

4961311 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4961312 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
4961313 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere
4961314 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4961315 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4961316 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4961317 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4961318 its easier to decide to opt out if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4961319 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4961320 we are not staying home with our children by default
4961321 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4961322 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
4961323 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4961324 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4961325 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4961326 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
4961327 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
4961328 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible

4961363 een menselijk wezen vormt een deel van het geheel dat door ons het universum wordt genoemd de mens ervaart zichzelf zijn gedachten en gevoelens als iets dat van de rest is afgescheiden dit is een soort optisch bedrog van zijn bewustzijn deze waan vormt een gevangenis voor ons het beperkt ons tot onze persoonlijke verlangens en tot affectie voor een paar mensen die ons het meest nabij zijn het is onze taak onszelf uit deze gevangenis te bevrijden door de kring van ons mededogen te vergroten en alle levende wezens en de gehele natuur in haar schoonheid te omhelzen

4961394 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
4961395 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
4961396 you feel terry will give 100 whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
4961397 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 in his game by being captain
4961398 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays
4961399 he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
4961400 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
4961401 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia

4961420 the concept of contemporary art of an art that is about ideas is relatively new in afghanistan
4961421 art can provide a forum for discussing subjects that are still primarily taboo in afghan society
4961422 by the time the students go through four years of traditional art courses and come to the subject of contemporary art they have already lost the ability to think out of the box

4961462 the slow food movement which encourages people to find locally produced whole foods and take care and delight in their preparation has found resonance around the world despite or perhaps because of the dominance of manufactured foods
4961463 in the same way making things with our hands the slow way may be more important now than it has ever been
4961464 very good facilities and the equipment required for the varied classes we offer
4961465 they can make art without much equipment as their focus matures the equipment they will need will become clearer
4961466 there might be some hobbyists some retirees and college students
4961467 then there are professional artists who want to try their hand at something new
4961468 my total experiencing with cork is trying to get it out of the end of a wine bottle
4961469 i dont know what to expect i have no preconceived ideas
4961470 nurturing our young artists as they make their first professional career steps
4961471 our program with the kenan institute and the unc school of the arts is a model partnership
4961472 we are introducing ncsa graduates to national professional networks and life long opportunities for growth and renewal enabling young artists access to studios and mentors is a great gift it is our desire for this program to give them an even greater chance for success as artists
4961473 to choose something that i was interested in vs just going through foundation courses
4961474 you dont get a choice at ncsa about what you want to do
4961475 being at penland was a great great supplement to that rigid environment where i could really experiment and learn what i wanted from the course at penland it was really more technical and just gaining skills and tools to use
4961476 just doesnt really have the level of diversity that i hoped it would
4961477 about what the climate of a place like penland might be
4961478 my experience indicates that the best thing to do is to take them there
4961479 its going to be something thats familiar something thats secure
4961480 they are cutting too much and eliminating too many programs that could be beneficial to the kids
4961481 the university circumstances are the canary in the mine shaft of where the state is going
4961482 the system in florida is being poorly funded and slowly strangled
4961483 theres no overall master plan for higher education in florida there is no single vision
4961484 higher learning environments are important to sustaining an enriching and prosperous state
4961485 the mere fact that we are having to turn away eligible freshman that we are having serious conversations about shrinking the size of the university system would suggest were barely at a minimum
4961486 we should create a statewide plan for each institution that identifies where they should be in terms of graduation rates retention rates and degree production
4961487 why wouldnt somebody want to go to another state where they could focus more clearly on their educational objectives instead of having to worry about cramming more students into a classroom than the fire marshal will allow
4961488 there are at least 3 000 qualified students out there 80 percent minority who are not attending fiu because we dont have the money
4961489 i dont see this letting up i see us as continuing to bleed
4961490 in florida if your family is wealthy and you can afford college you get it for free
4961491 if youre poor you dont get a chance to go thats just backward
4961492 we dont have enough money to remain a high quality system for very long
4961493 older adults who consumed tuna or other baked or broiled fish had a lower risk of having abnormalities on brain mris
4961494 this study looked at whether or not different types of fish intake were related to structural changes in the brain
4961495 we didnt find any association with eating fried fish and having lower rates of these abnormalities
4961496 the message to the public is to eat more fish that has higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids rather than eating more fried fish
4961497 this may be related to the more than one factor analogous to the mediterranean diet that is also rich in fish and fruits and vegetables and has been frequently associated with less cardiovascular risk
4961498 it was almost like a standalone office within the county with little oversight
4961499 they hope to end it by the end of the year

4961517 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4961518 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4961519 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4961520 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4961521 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4961522 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4961523 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4961524 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4961525 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4961526 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4961527 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4961528 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4961529 yeah right shes not going to let you yank it out
4961530 ansley you need to go to sleep it is late you are exhausted and youre going to feel awful tomorrow if you dont get some rest
4961531 die privaten krankenversicherer kommen momentan von allen seiten unter druck
4961532 ich w rde jedem raten der kann noch in diesem jahr in die private krankenversicherung zu wechseln
4961533 in einigen jahren wird es f r kunden keinen unterschied mehr zwischen alten und neuen tarifen geben
4961534 der druck steigt es kommen deutlich weniger neukunden nach also wird verst rkt um die bestehenden kunden innerhalb des pkv systems geworben
4961535 i think the public understands that if there is any evidence of excessive force we will do something to address it
4961536 ive got five kids man we live in the same house i have kids running around everywhere
4961537 he said i can drink a little bit chase it down with water
4961538 i was about to pull over but he kept trying to open the door
4961539 i didnt take him to get any drugs i didnt see him do any drugs
4961540 he said 2334 would you please help me he held onto the gate yelling help me dont kill me he seemed to give up and doubled back up hawthorne then turned down hawthorne again
4961541 i thought he was going to bust the door down
4961542 was holding his hand or arm like he hurt his hand or got a cut
4961543 the lady tasered him and then they cuffed him it looked like he was halfway on the curb and they stomped on him or something and you could see him on the pavement and they stepped on his back
4961544 appear to show that he was struck or hit in a way that shows he was defending himself
4961545 of course we cant say for sure who injured him
4961546 but it appears that some time close to his death within hours or maybe minutes someone beat him
4961547 he has too many injuries and bruising and swelling to have not been beaten
4961548 beat up is a subjective term sure so is excessive force youve seen the photographs so i cant say there was no trauma
4961549 i want people to understand what happened to this guy but i want a complete picture
4961550 i really just cant add it all up yet because i still dont have key pieces of evidence
4961551 if you do have hypothetically an episode of excited delirium weve been told that you shouldnt use pain inducing techniques to control the subject things like bean bags batons etc
4961552 in that case the best solution might be taser bursts and verbal commands that way officers can quiet the person and get the proper medical care for him

4961556 this war is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
4961557 the heavy rain means that the quality of the crops declines a large part of the cereals harvest in central sweden has been lost and has become fodder which gives a lower price
4961558 we have not as yet noted any problems with quality but we dont know how it is going to look when we get going again after the rain
4961559 when a healthy strong seed kernel is soaked in the rain suffers drought and then drenched again the kernel becomes active and starts to grow into a new plant it is when this process begins that quality is affected which we have already noted in several places
4961560 it then becomes doubtful whether the crops can even be used for fodder
4961561 fourteen days to 3 weeks of warm dry weather preferably windy would enable most of it to be collected
4961562 we will have to wait a couple of weeks for good weather it is looking generally unstable in the near future with two fronts of low pressure in the coming week

4961570 you can make these up to one week in advance
4961571 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4961572 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is

4961581 well it feels nice to work in different countries know the culture and musical tastes of the people across borders
4961582 there is no report of any untoward incident from any part of the valley
4961583 the film is a classic and needed realistic background to support the script when you compare the budget of this film with tamil or telgu film it is still much smaller
4961584 in our industry it is the first time that so much money have been invested on shooting locales and international artists this is also the first south indian film entirely was shot in uk
4961585 terrorists are operating in kerala but their main activities are outside the state when we took police action against some of them there was a hue and cry from human rights activists saying that minorities were being targeted human rights activists should understand that its just a minority among minority which is indulging in such activities

4961590 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
4961591 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
4961592 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4961593 the more you structure material the more you summarize either as an editor or using technology the more you make material specific to a context or time the less utility that material has as things change for years now i have asked this question at conferences around the world faced with an intractable problem do you go and draw down best practice from your companys knowledge management system or do you go and find eight or nine people you know and trust with relevant experience and listen to their stories
4961594 we live in a world subject to constant change and its better to blend fragments at the time of need than attempt to anticipate all needs we are moving from attempting to anticipate the future to creating an attitude and capability of anticipatory awareness
4961595 the free flow of the blogosphere ad hoc collaboration facebook and many other tools work because they conform with the patterns of expectation that arise from our evolutionary uncertainty
4961596 until recently the secret of success was to learn what had worked in the past and do that
4961597 this is great if the context of the blog post suits the need of your situation but what if it doesnt is the arguement that blogs are not trying to be what they cant be vs codified documents that have an intention they cannot meet they are not achieving what they are intending to achieve so nothing can have a constant context blog post or not
4961598 i can send back an email in a couple of seconds to someone with whom i share a certain context i can leave out all the details when i reply to him her but when i want to answer him her via my blog i also have to think about all the other people that dont share that context because they dont theyll be frustrated when they read my post writing such a post instead of an email would take more of my time or am i missing something
4961599 can you just move an email conversation to a blog without providing more context to other readers
4961600 some have millions of documents in primary edms storage but they have literally no idea which ones are important thanks to centralised storage and centralised access nobody can find what they need and eveybody fears they are missing something important but contrary to the km orthodoxy you cannot actually codify knowledge it downgrades to information when stored in databases and crumbles to dust
4961601 the problem with existing enterprise software is that there is simply not enough diversity of inputs to stimulate intuitive decision making which is why the most adept individuals in organisations rely on more basic offline techniques to know what is going on
4961602 the information overload people face within organisations today is the worst kind the wrong sort of information with no individual control over inputs
4961603 instead of trying to gather all data and then analyse it in real time we need to help people build a better radar go with the flow and trust in their own ability to sense what matters and make decisions we need more peripheral and contextual information and less sequential memo and email processing we need to create multiple paths to things we need to improve findability as peter morville says rather than focus just on storage and retrieval classification within organisations is calcification it kills context social navigation and filtering is cheaper and more effective we need a new relationship between people in companies we are hard wired for socialisation but enterprise tools are based on 1950s management thinking that treats us like machines in a production line the focus of information sharing in support of decision making should be on weaving the social web and allowing people to negotiate their own language and meaning by adding social markup to existing corporate data
4961604 the first time around knowledge management was hardly a smashing success when organizations several years ago tried to take advantage of the experience and insights of their workers they captured information in large structured data systems for access and retrieval unfortunately those systems were often cumbersome and difficult to use leading to low levels of participation and abandoned knowledge bases workers also suspected their own positions might be at risk after they shared their personal insights and knowledge
4961605 change happens too fast for people and organizations to rely exclusively on structured processes and the rigid it solutions that support them
4961606 understanding about the role of knowledge in empowering people rigid structured systems for data capture can easily be supplemented with more user friendly applications that provide better integration into day to day work
4961607 it is virtually impossible to design a process that anticipates every potential outcome a dke embraces people as part of structured processes and enables them to access the resources they need in a more flexible and responsive way when people are empowered as a part of process driven work organizations can achieve the economy of structure combined with the responsiveness and adaptability that only people can provide

4961609 earlier post about knowledge and information the insightful comment and i would like to share it here she alludes to the impossible act of managing knowledge and instead says the aim is to
4961610 youre in the middle of the mojave desert you come upon a gas station but its abandoned lying on the counter is a map most would consider the map information data in context but theres another criteria it isnt information until its in individually relevant context it has to be both important and understandable to me in the middle of the desert there is no context the map is useless noise
4961611 i know where you are going paula km is integrated into how you work in the future there may not be km as its just how we work km is simply common sense a way of being why would you work any other way the net generation would not have a clue they are knowledge workers they are just being
4961612 this stuff that organically emerges or manifests tells them something about themselves they are learning from their interactions by participating they can take back these rich insights and apply this new thinking in their doing as you put it
4961613 social tools are humanistic as they are about conversation and connection thats how we get work done in the offine world
4961614 i can see we need information managers but im not sure about knowledge managers rather we need people that are more humanistic learning type facilitators
4961615 but we do need someone to make sure that all these knowledge sharing activities and way of being are occuring this person will be managing knowledge related activities not knowledge itself
4961616 the goal is not to manage knowledge but to facilitate action or enhance thinking
4961617 even more fundamental to the deeper philosophy here is that knowledge is relevant it can only reasonably be applied to specific conditions few knowledge management technologies embrace the reailty and ensure that the relevant conditions are captured and likewise communicated
4961618 provided with the right tools and a culture that values openness knowledge gets transferred effectively without management
4961619 i think it fairly self evident that a large number of business goals require knowledge to be managed in some form or other
4961620 debates raged about the best ways to move back and forth between the codified explicit knowledge and the less obvious often invisible tacit knowledge that surfaces in human interaction and how best to enable or enhance the collaborative and interactive use of information and knowledge to get things done or create additional useful knowledge
4961621 knowledge transfer is self assembling and self organizing it really cant be otherwise it is
4961622 the idea that we must make knowledge workers unusually altruistic to get them to share and transfer knowledge ignores the many examples of social systems and organizations in which collaboration is based on normal motivations including self interest
4961623 we need to think more carefully about combining top down design and direction of business processes with the bottom up use of knowledge objects the combination of structure and organic generation and synthesis can help manage effectively in continuous flows of incoming and outgoing information knowledge objects are anything that we can coherently manage
4961624 an appropriate amount of structure design constraints is necessary to enable consistent recall and findability of information
4961625 i do think we need a new word for what is often understood as
4961626 km can exist without the technology the technology offers a platform for pervasiveness and ease of implementation but without management drive cultural capability localised or across the organisation and openness youre doomed tech or no tech
4961627 i am still at a loss as to what is uniquely km and to what purpose it serves that is not already served by established disciplines
4961628 anything 2 0 is not about the technology technology is and always has been an enabler
4961629 organisations feel they need a km practice because they dont actually do the things that embed km practices into corporate dna
4961630 km only needs a revolution where km is implemented as a widget
4961631 km is not about tools it is about how we understand what is important in value creation
4961632 that exactly where the shift is from documentation to conversation
4961633 with this shift there is another shift happening we change both our conception of knowledge management and knowledge itself we now concentrate on knowledge sharing and we understand knowledge differently
4961634 when it comes to defining knowledge one can distinguishes three dialectics explicit vs tacit ontological vs contextual and private vs public the first one is based on the physical status of knowledge the second one on its epistemological status and the third one on its economical status
4961635 in the km era explicit ontological private understanding prevails that is the reason why there are many processes explicitation data ontology and egoist knowledge is power behaviors this later is the reason why km fails
4961636 we try to work on present knowledge not past knowledge we try to materialize conversations knowledge on the go ecm focuses on the result a document enterprise 2 0 tools focus on the journey between the idea generation and idea formalization in between what you have there is individual and collective work reflexion and conversation enterprise 2 0 tools capture at the very same time they enable conversations and in a much more efficient way than emails distributed by nature as centralized in one place a blog a wiki you now have knowledge management on the go
4961637 while km was regarded as a specific job with a specific team who has specific expertise it is now dispersed throughout the organization as embedded in operational processes there is no km anymore because it is just everywhere
4961638 but what happens now with knowledge sharing is not often the responsibility of the km team
4961639 they dont have to deal with data and documents they have to deal with people
4961640 seen as creating a more enduring change in the learner to enable him her to perform better across a specified range of future tasks
4961641 the restoration of the organic the human and the personal to a central place in economics
4961642 the end of modernity because what collapsed was the most decisive attempt to make modernity work
4961643 the conscious management of self organizing systems for sustenance and enrichment of human life and purposes
4961644 s cience comprehends the thought of the reality not reality itself the thought of life not life that is its limit its only really insuperable limit
4961645 is wholly fugitive and temporary but also wholly palpitating with reality and individuality sensibility sufferings joys aspirations needs and passions
4961646 the perpetual immolation of life fugitive temporary but real on the altar of eternal abstractions

4961648 the bodies of individuals they will ask nothing better than to perform experiments on the social body
4961649 every time that scientific men emerging from their abstract world mingle with living creation in the real world all that they propose or create is poor ridiculously abstract bloodless and lifeless still born
4961650 the revolt of life against science or rather against the government of science
4961651 not to destroy science that would be high treason to humanity but to remand it to its place
4961652 be solved only in one way by the liquidation of science as a moral being existing outside the life of all
4961653 it will become one in fact with the immediate and real life of all individuals
4961654 anarchism is a world concept based on a a mechanical explanation of all phenomena its method of investigation is that of the exact natural sciences and every conclusion it comes to must be verified by the method by which every scientific conclusion must be verified
4961655 the anarchist movement sprang up in response to the lessons of actual life and originated from the practical tendencies of events
4961656 n ot out of the universities does anarchism come anarchism was born among the people and it will continue to be full of life and creative power only as long as it remains a thing of the people
4961657 most men of science either belong by descent to the possessing classes and are steeped in the prejudices of their class or else are in the actual serivce of the government
4961658 to recover the supremacy of the concrete with its rich wealth of qualities differentia and solidity over and beyond a transcendental concept of science as method is to slap the face of an arrogant intellectualism with the ungloved hand of reality
4961659 just as we can justifiably distinguish between an authoritarian and a libertarian technics so too can we distinguish between authoritarian and libertarian modes of reason

4961665 what kind of science do we want and what do we want it for
4961666 there occur at rare umpredictable intervals moments when an infinitesimally small force because of its character and its position in the whole constellation of events was able to effect a very large transformation

4961668 earlier i was into farming but now i have bought a car which is though broken but has giving me better earning than before now my per day earning is 70 100 rupees
4961669 earlier i used to sell potatoes now with the opening of the tata factory i have opened a tea stall here and my earning has improved similar shops have also come up in the area
4961670 after coming up of the tata plant the rates of the land here have increased considerably the youths of the area are now getting jobs we are expecting that in coming days more such jobs will be created the vacant houses nearby have all been occupied so overall the factory has opened up avenues of earning for lot of people
4961671 this medicinal or ayurvedic garden is been developed with the aim to make people aware of the various medicinal plants that can be used in our homes from day to day weve planted many medicinal plants that can help cure ailments at our home like sore throat upset stomach gastritis problems and many more people using these plants need not visit a doctor but cure the diseases at their homes here there are over 300 species of ayurvedic herbs planted here
4961672 for future weve constructed one hall at the garden so that we can install a manufacturing plant here where we can use and process these plants to make medicines apart from this to provide information among the masses well maintain a library with relevant and authentic reference books on medicinal plants and their benefits
4961673 the essence of a thought can be expressed succinctly in blank verse but for me the rhyme of rhythm is more attractive it also enables me to put things in better perspective and has a lyrical quality which is a source of great joy

4961750 espa a se ha convertido en la segunda destinaci n mundial en n mero de turistas
4961751 la crisis se notar en el consumo de los viajes y sobretodo en el sector servicios a estas alturas la mayor a de la poblaci n ya tiene planificadas las vacaciones y es consciente de su presupuesto as que si tienen que recortar alg n gasto lo har n en los extras

4961755 dejar de potenciar el turismo low cost y apostar por el turista de calidad como el que llega en un crucero el de golf o el pasajero de negocios

4961770 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
4961771 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged

4961793 its tempting just to ride the lines but as lear you have to identify with every moment of the play and with what is going on emotionally
4961794 of all the great roles i think lear requires the most emotional authenticity we all accumulate more sorrow than we look for as we go through life and we usually try to repress it
4961795 but when you perform a role like lear you have to take the lid off i dont think it can be done unless youre willing to go to terribly dark places
4961796 i went on after literally five rehearsals as hamlet i would never wish that on anyone but in retrospect im kind of glad it happened the way it did
4961797 the exchanges of dialogue were harder to master than the soliloquies because you cant do that by yourself but the soliloquies are also the greatest hits
4961798 so you have to ask yourself how do i make it specific to this production how do i make to be or not to be my own
4961799 it was really fresh and i used that emotion which helped me understand hecuba much more clearly it still brings tears to my eyes
4961800 so to get the chance to do something like hecuba was a huge challenge and very exciting i felt lucky just to be there
4961801 on any role i start with the script and work from there
4961802 i know that people die for a chance to play arkadina but i just try to have fun
4961803 the thing thats comforting about these classic roles is that theres no wrong way to play them as long as you can learn the lines you cant mess them up too much you may give a great performance or you may not but theres no way that an actor can harm a great play these plays take care of you
4961804 so we decided to bring it back to its classical music roots people are interested in that
4961805 a charming town for musicians to come in and spend a three day residency
4961806 in the next 10 years we will experience more change than in the 50 years before
4961807 some degree of hybridization will be evident in all vehicles produced in 2020 and beyond
4961808 energy storage is in the heart of the next generation of efforts for fuel economy
4961809 the era when all work could be done within the industry is over
4961810 now we need to interface with several external entities to get work done
4961811 we can also refocus family support and education programs to discuss alcohol misuse and to educate all on resources available in the military in the department of veterans affairs and in the civilian community
4961812 the national guard is constantly seeking better ways to maintain and improve the behavioral health and general well being of its warriors through synergistic programs including chaplain support family support employment assistance advocacy counseling and training and this new position is another way of meeting those needs
4961813 we recognize the unique needs of our citizen soldiers and airmen and are constantly looking for innovative ways that we can better meet those needs
4961814 any questions relating to the companies relation with the employee is fine it shows me that the person is interested in the company
4961815 thirdly look up their stock and see how strong their company is and this could help you negotiate a salary when that time comes

4961831 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us 70 000 fans will be watching the relay at the nfl ravens game tonight the team based in his home town of baltimore and it has been shown at sports events across the country
4961832 i have heard people say its crazy they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television
4961833 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4961834 after the 200 im i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit it was pretty exciting
4961835 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4961836 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4961837 michael phelps you cant put it in words what he has done here his level of achievement is phenomenal and i dont think it will ever be seen again
4961838 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
4961839 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
4961840 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
4961841 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
4961842 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
4961843 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
4961844 then of course theres just so much to rip on
4961845 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
4961846 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons

4961848 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
4961849 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
4961850 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
4961851 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
4961852 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
4961853 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
4961854 he said its healthy to get that scared now and then
4961855 its tempting just to ride the lines but as lear you have to identify with every moment of the play and with what is going on emotionally
4961856 of all the great roles i think lear requires the most emotional authenticity we all accumulate more sorrow than we look for as we go through life and we usually try to repress it
4961857 but when you perform a role like lear you have to take the lid off i dont think it can be done unless youre willing to go to terribly dark places
4961858 i went on after literally five rehearsals as hamlet i would never wish that on anyone but in retrospect im kind of glad it happened the way it did
4961859 the exchanges of dialogue were harder to master than the soliloquies because you cant do that by yourself but the soliloquies are also the greatest hits
4961860 so you have to ask yourself how do i make it specific to this production how do i make to be or not to be my own
4961861 it was really fresh and i used that emotion which helped me understand hecuba much more clearly it still brings tears to my eyes

4961866 so we decided to bring it back to its classical music roots people are interested in that
4961867 a charming town for musicians to come in and spend a three day residency
4961868 we are all looking forward to the air conditioning at an event held in late august
4961869 without the funds raised at the annual book sale we would have to drastically reduce the valuable programs we offer

4961875 in practice the power of any conspiracy rises and falls in inverse proportion to the power of its internal conspiracies mutual guilt and bribery mainly hold together conspiracies whose ideologies command insufficient loyalty but this makes them vulnerable

4961919 i had to wash our uniforms in my hotel bath and hang them off the balcony after our games he said
4961920 england had five full time coaches and a medical staff with them
4961921 they even employed a full time kit man to wash uniforms they had a budget of 20 000 for the tournament just for uniforms
4961922 i think italy was shocked that we brought that much effort it took them by surprise
4961923 if we had more financial support i feel we would have gone further we would pick the top 20 players regardless of their money status
4961924 we had to buy our own plane tickets to pensacola for training camp in addition to paying for the hotel and food
4961925 i believe there are many players out there who would love to have the chance to show their skills but cant afford to do so
4961926 we have had six weekends together in the three years we have been preparing for this world cup

4961947 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice
4961948 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4961949 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative
4961950 although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying

4961959 michaels been working hard with our forwards for some time now and weve seen the results in the waratahs set piece play and scrummaging in particular
4961960 during the super 14 michael has been a familiar face around the place so to know that weve got him full time now is a major coup for nsw rugby
4961961 i have enjoyed my time with the wallabies immensely and there is still much to be done over the next few months
4961962 looking further ahead what this opportunity with the waratahs provides is an appealing opportunity to be at home more frequently
4961963 with four children thats very important to me and my family
4961964 the travel demands over the past three seasons have been extensive
4961965 michaels contribution to the wallabies over the past three years cannot be underestimated
4961966 i have admired his commitment and work ethic to the task of improving our set pieces
4961967 im equally sure the waratahs will appreciate that same level of passion for improving the standard of forward play in australian rugby
4961968 its always big this time of year to come over here where our records poor we were keen to address that and it was a big win by the boys

4961996 there were times when if anyone argued that the jews belong to a people that has gentile origins he would be classified as an anti semite on the spot today if anyone dares to suggest that those who are considered jews in the world have never constituted and still do not constitute a people or a nation he is immediately condemned as a hater of israel
4961997 who wandered across seas and continents reached the ends of the earth and finally with the advent of zionism made a u turn and returned en masse to their orphaned homeland
4961998 i started looking in research studies about the exile from the land a constitutive event in jewish history almost like the holocaust but to my astonishment i discovered that it has no literature the reason is that no one exiled the people of the country the romans did not exile peoples and they could not have done so even if they had wanted to they did not have trains and trucks to deport entire populations that kind of logistics did not exist until the 20th century from this in effect the whole book was born in the realization that judaic society was not dispersed and was not exiled
4961999 no population remains pure over a period of thousands of years but the chances that the palestinians are descendants of the ancient judaic people are much greater than the chances that you or i are its descendents the first zionists up until the arab revolt 1936 9 knew that there had been no exiling and that the palestinians were descended from the inhabitants of the land they knew that farmers dont leave until they are expelled
4962000 from the perspective of zionism this country does not belong to its citizens but rather to the jewish people i recognize one definition of a nation a group of people that wants to live in sovereignty over itself but most of the jews in the world have no desire to live in the state of israel even though nothing is preventing them from doing so therefore they cannot be seen as a nation
4962001 in the israeli discourse about roots there is a degree of perversion this is an ethnocentric biological genetic discourse but israel has no existence as a jewish state
4962002 we must begin to work hard to transform our place into an israeli republic where ethnic origin as well as faith will not be relevant in the eyes of the law

4962032 soldiers have no control over how they are utilized they sign up for a great many reasons but the reason i signed up at 17 was because i thought that it was something i needed to do to earn the right to live in our society
4962033 if you choose not to support a government by not enlisting then that is fine by me but dont blame the soldiers for the governments misuse of them in wars and conflicts that so many of the soldiers would rather not be involved with in the first place

4962057 sadly iraq is beyond that point but there are soldiers there now trying to rebuild and fix the problems started by this administrations jump to war
4962058 insinuation that because some soldiers commit war crimes all soldiers have a penchant for the same sort of bloodlust
4962059 i was a soldier so you have no right to argue with me about military matters
4962060 the central role of these armies is to defend the nation your description of their central role of defenders of wealth and position ignores the fact that as it has been stated by many on this thread the way the bush administration and its supporters in the uks government is not the correct and just way to use a standing army you continue to equate the way these criminals are currently using our military to what their central role as a military actually is in current human society but it will continue to be a quite fallacious equation

4962073 last post the final word from our first world war soldiers
4962074 you and i are among those who are asking serious questions and by that very fact i know that there is something to which you and i do belong we belong to that minority that has carried on the big discourse of the rational mind to the big discourse that has been going on or off and on since the western society began some two thousand years ago in the small communities of athens and jerusalem maybe you think that is a pretty vague thing to which to belong if you do think that you are mistaken it is quite a thing to belong to the big discourse even if as lesser participants and as i hope presently to make clear it is the beginning of any sense of belonging that is worthwhile it is the key to the only kind of belonging that free people in our time might have and i think that to belong to it requires that we try to live up to what it demands of us what it demands of us first of all is that we maintain our sense of it and just now at this point in human history that is quite difficult for we belong not only to the big discourse of the rational mind we also belong although we do not always feel that we do to our own epoch accordingly since we are live people and not detached minds we are trying to live in and with a certain set of feelings the feelings of political people trying to be rational in an epoch of enormous irrationality ii what is the dominant mood of people like us who try to think up questions and answer them for ourselves what is the tang and feel of our experience as we examine the world about us today it is clear that these feelings are shaping the way we ask and the way we answer all the questions of this conference it is also clear let us admit it that our mood is not buoyant not calm not steady and not sure it is true that we do not panic but it is also true that we possess the crisis mentality and none of us can be up to the demands of our time unless we share something of this kind of mind for it is rooted in an adequate sense of history and of our place in history we are often stunned and we are often distracted and we are bewildered almost all of the time and the only weapon we have as individuals and as a scatter of grouplets is the delicate brain now so perilously balanced in the struggle for public sanity we feel that common political sense is no longer a sound basis of judgment for the common sense of the twentieth century is based largely upon an eighteenth and a nineteenth century experience which is outmoded by new facts of public life with which we have had little to do except as victims the more we understand what is happening in the world the more frustrated we often become for our knowledge leads to feelings of powerlessness we feel that we are living in a world in which the citizen has become a mere spectator or a forced actor and that our personal experience is politically useless and our political will a minor illusion very often the fear of total permanent war paralyzes the kind of morally oriented politics which might engage our interests and our passions we sense the cultural mediocrity around us and in us and we know that ours is a time when within and between all the nations of the world the levels of public sensibility have sunk below sight atrocity on a mass scale has become impersonal and official moral indignation as a public fact has become extinct or made trivial we feel that distrust has become nearly universal among men of affairs and that the spread of public anxiety is poisoning human relations and drying up the roots of private freedom we see that the people at the top often identify rational dissent with political mutiny loyalty with blind conformity and freedom of judgment with treason we feel that irresponsibility has become organized in high places and that clearly those in charge of the historic decisions of our time are not up to them but what is more damaging to us is that we feel that those on the bottom the forced actors who take the consequences are also without leaders without ideas of opposition and that they make no real demands upon those in power iii we do not of course feel all of this all of the time but we often feel some of it and in the dark of the night when we are really alone and really awake we suspect that this might very well be an honest articulation of our deepest political feelings and if we are justified even in half of these feelings then we have at hand a second answer to the question of whether we are losing our sense of belonging our first answer you will remember was a general yes except in the sense that we belong to the big discourse our second answer reflects our feelings about the sort of world we are living in and may be put in this way i dont know whether or not you are losing your political sense of belonging but i should certainly hope so the point is that we are among those who cannot get their mouths around all the little yeses that add up to tacit acceptance of a world run by crackpot realists and subject to blind drift and that you see is something to which we do belong we belong to those who are still capable of personally rejecting our minds are not yet captive i believe that just now in the kind of political world we are in rejection is more important than acceptance for in such a world to accept freely requires first of all the personal capacity and the social chance to reject the official myths and the unofficial distractions iv i hope i have made it clear that the question of losing our sense of political belonging cannot be answered with moral sensibility unless we also ask to what is it that we ought to belong mere loyalty alone is less a virtue than an escape from freely thought out choices among the many values that now compete for our loyalties my own answer to this question which may well be different from yours can be put very simply if we are human what we ought to belong to first of all is ourselves we ought to belong to ourselves as individuals once upon a time that answer would have seemed clear for it used to be called the appeal to conscience but we now know that this is much too simple an answer for we now know that there are people whose conscience is perfectly clear and perfectly sincere and perfectly corrupt in its consequences for themselves and for others so we must add to this answer one further point to the extent that we are truly human we should try seriously to participate in that rational discourse of which i have spoken and to the extent that we do so our sensibilities will have been shaped by the highpoints of mankinds heritage of conduct and character and thought accordingly we shall belong and we ought to belong to mankind and it is to mankind that we ought most freely to give our loyalties all other loyalties it seems to me ought to be qualified by these two loyalty to ourselves and loyalty to the cultural heritage of mankind that we allow to shape us as individuals this answer is more a beginning than an end we ought to use it to judge all principles and organizations that demand our loyalties no corporation no church no nation no labor union no political party no organization or creed is worthy of our loyalties if it does not facilitate the growth of loyalties to ourselves and to the heritage that mankind has produced in its best moments moreover we ought not to be committed absolutely to any organization our loyalty is conditional otherwise it is not loyalty it is not the belonging of free people it is a compelled obedience let us not confuse the loyalties of free people with mere obedience to authority when organizations or nations sell out the values of free people free people withdraw their loyalties not with a yes but or a maybe yes maybe no but with a big plain flat no v the positive question for us is not so much whether we are losing our sense of belonging as whether we can help build something that is worth belonging to perhaps that has always been the major social question for men and women shaped by the big discourse for just as freedom that has not been fought for is lightly cast off so belonging that does not require the building and the maintaining of organizations worth belonging to is often merely a yearning for a new bondage to really belong we have got first to get it clear with ourselves that we do not belong and do not want to belong to an unfree world as free men and women we have got to reject much of it and to know why we are rejecting it we have got second to get it clear within ourselves that we can truly only belong to organizations which we have a real part in building or maintaining directly and openly and all of the time and we have got third to realize that it is only in the struggle for what we really believe as individuals and as members of economic political and social groups that the sense of belonging befitting a free person in an unfree world can exist in such a world only the comradeship of such a struggle is worthy of our loyalty and only to such truly human associations as we might create do we as rational people wish to belong

4962308 the systematic abuses by sri lankan government forces are among the most serious imaginable

4962322 minister fernandopulle belonged to both a religious and ethnic minority and could have played a greater role in rebuilding relations between the ethnic communities and the warring parties instead he was a proponent of the governments strategy of military confrontation with the ltte which claimed his life at the same time he assisted civil society groups such as ours when it fell within his domain of authority despite our critical stances minister fernandopulle was one of the governments key speakers and his absence will be felt at the forthcoming eastern provincial elections where he would have played an important role we urge the government to ensure that all high risk candidates at these elections icluding leader of the sri lanka muslim congress rauf hakeem whose security is being sought to be reduced should be provided with additional security
4962323 this is most likely the work of the ltte it follows closely on the fort railway station bombing in which also several young schoolboy sportsmen from d s senanayake college were killed the massacre of the innocents anywhere benefits no just cause and has no place whatsoever in any agenda for dignity and peace for sri lankans such provocative acts of violence spread fear suspicion and anger they further widen the gap between our communities and further reduce whatever chances may have existed for peace conversations
4962324 the evidence shows state security forces including police killed the 17 aid workers and that senior police officers covered it up the killing of civilians during time of conflict is a war crime the perpetrators and their superiors should be brought to justice

4962327 the country has learnt to be comfortable with grave crimes going unpunished one after another with the certainty that even graver ones would follow the answer to the question why sri lanka is steeped in recurrent gross crimes especially against the minorities that go unchecked is not far to seek for years the state has gone on denying obfuscating abusing detractors intimidating or killing witnesses and making matters progressively worse

4962329 creativity is a mental process involving the generation of new ideas or concepts or new associations of the creative mind between existing ideas or concepts from a scientific point of view the products of creative thought sometimes referred to as divergent thought are usually considered to have both originality and appropriateness an alternative more everyday conception of creativity is that it is simply the act of making something new
4962330 creative thinking is the process we use to develop ideas that are unique usefulm and worthy of further elaboration

4962368 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4962369 i have the memories the pictures ill have the memories forever every suit every pair of goggles i have everything
4962370 michael phelps you cant put it in words in my opinion well never see it again
4962371 there is no comparison in the swimming world to what michaels done
4962372 it would be like playing seven games of a football season and never ever being behind completing every pass
4962373 its a far more competitive world than it was at any other time in the past its unprecedented
4962374 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4962375 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4962376 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4962377 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4962378 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4962379 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4962380 ok we dont have to go longer on that one

4962386 i dont tend to exercise apart from walking to the shops but when i was offered the part of jenny in doctor who i knew i would have to get fit so i did about five months of karate that definitely helped when it came to all the jumping fighting and running across rooftops in code 9
4962387 this might annoy feminists but i think doctor who has to be male not female its like having a female james bond it wouldnt work

4962394 its just about playing right and getting ready for cal
4962395 offensively we have to run the ball more effectively i thought we were a little sloppy but we battled back
4962396 defensively we played pretty well against the run especially we were pretty physical i like where were going as a football team our guys have worked extremely hard and we have two weeks to be ready
4962397 hes clearing up some personal things and i expect for him to be back
4962398 he basically has risen up and is playing very very well
4962399 where they are going to show up first is on special teams
4962400 we repped a lot of them on special teams and went live on special teams today so that was as big an emphasis as anything
4962401 usually that job is for hawken but ive been catching the ball in practice
4962402 the head to ball mentality rod has we need that and when he comes back well welcome him with open arms
4962403 hes a good fit and he did well i applaud him he did a selfless move

4962431 thank you for your dedication for making my surgical stay a most pleasant one the nurses were always there with a smile or an answer to any medical question that i had no matter how simple or complicated the experience i had at milford hospital helped to enable me to pass a good word on about your reputation to the community it was a privilege to be a patient at your joint replacement center

4962451 the russian military has effective control over the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
4962452 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly

4962456 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilized
4962457 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4962458 russian president dmitry medvedev has said we are to withdraw
4962459 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4962460 this was clearly a case of attempted murder we could have been dealing with multiple casualties this morning and the devastation that would have caused throughout the community
4962461 there are a number of families out there who will be counting their blessings that they are not grieving for a loved one
4962462 the disregard that this shows for the lives of the local community and my officers is unbelievable

4962477 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4962478 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
4962479 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
4962480 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4962481 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
4962482 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
4962483 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4962484 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4962485 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4962486 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4962487 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4962488 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4962489 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time
4962490 this reduces traffic congestion and fuel use and also saves time
4962491 i believe you should go out and do what you can rather than just complain or tell other people how to do the job he says
4962492 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4962493 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

4962495 the medical profession which is based on boundless respect for human life had an obligation to lead society away from disrespect of so many lives
4962496 the generations of african american physicians excluded from the mainstream of american medicine and the patients whose needs went unmet because of this exclusion
4962497 it should have acted strictly from a medical standpoint and broadened participation to all within the profession
4962498 they want to accept it but they want to think about how to accept it
4962499 remains largely segregated which contributes powerfully to racial disparities in care

4962503 chris arnzen is an outstanding talk show host who does a splendid job contending for the faith through his radio ministry
4962504 i believe that chris arnzen radio program iron sharpens iron is providing christians with a very helpful and useful means of keeping people aware of developments on the wider church scene i commend him for what he is doing and fervently hope that it will continue to be owned of god and that it will prepare people to be like the children of issachar who were men who had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do 1chronicles 12 32

4962507 iron sharpens iron is one of few radio programs that address major biblical issues of the day without compromising truth

4962510 going back to very ancient times it was in cities that there developed an openness to the world to other ways of thinging and acting whether we think of athens or alexandria or medieval paris or renaissance florence or of the turbulent urban centers of modern history we can identify a certain cosmopolitan consciousness that was especially characteristic of city culture the individual then who is not only urban but urbane is one whoe however passionately he may be attached to his own city roams through the whole wide world in his intellectual voyages his mind if not his body and emotions is at home wherever there are other men who think we would submit that sociological consciousness is marked by the same kind of cosmopolitanism
4962511 someone once defined urbane sophistication as being the capacity to remain quite unperturbed upon seeing in front of ones house a man dressed in a turban and a loincloth a snake coiled around his neck beating a tom tom as he leads a leashed tiger down the street
4962512 um we finally get to go on that shopping spree in the city the one daddy said no to

4962514 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4962515 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4962516 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4962517 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4962518 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4962519 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4962520 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4962521 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4962522 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4962523 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4962524 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4962525 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4962526 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4962527 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4962528 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4962529 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4962530 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4962531 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4962532 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4962533 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
4962534 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4962535 ook de conflicten tussen economische klassen waarover de grote ideologie n van de voorbije twee eeuwen gingen verdwijnen naar de achtergrond en worden
4962536 het evenwicht in de steden van het vlaams gewest werd verstoord door het vertrek van de gegoede klassen uit de centrale wijken waar conflicten ontstonden tussen immigranten en de rest van de oorspronkelijke armere inwoners deze spanningen werkten de opmars van extreemrechts in de hand vooral in antwerpen
4962537 in het waals gewest waren vroeger een aantal sterk geconcentreerde stedelijke industriekernen te vinden vooral toegespitst op steenkool en staal met fabrieken die meestal in de buurt van arbeiderswijken werden ingeplant
4962538 given the human endowment in what ways do people attach meaning to and organize space and place
4962539 what begins as undifferentiated space ends as a single object situation or place
4962540 the human being by his mere presence imposes a schema on space
4962541 place can acquire deep meaning for the adult through the steady accretion of sentiment over the years
4962542 the mind learns to grapple with spatial relations long after the body has mastered them in performance but the mind once on its exploratory path creates large and complex spatial schemata that exceed by far what an individual can encompass through direct experience with the help of the mind human spatial ability though not agility rises above that of all other species
4962543 spatial ability precedes spatial knowledge mental worlds are refined out of sensory and kinesthetic experiences spatial knowledge enhances spatial ability
4962544 literary art draws attention to areas of experience that we may otherwise fail to notice
4962545 places can be made visible by a number of means rivalry or conflict with other places visual prominence and the evocative power of art architecture ceremonials and rites human places become vividly real through dramatization identity of place is achieved by dramatizing the aspirations needs and functional rhythms of personal and group life

4962563 my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4962564 my family and myself are very thankful to the club the fans and the city and we will never give up fighting to get the best for liverpool
4962565 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 with the fans with the players and with the club in general i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
4962566 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
4962567 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
4962568 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
4962569 i thought this four years ago and i think it now if you are quicker it is easier to sign the target you have
4962570 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
4962571 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money
4962572 it is not something that i can explain you have to analyse it but to me it is clear they were supporting me if we had money and we do have money
4962573 yeah thats a type of player we just dont have
4962574 those could have been our moments we didnt turn those into goals very sad otherwise it was us in the semi finals next tuesday
4962575 we had trouble against equal or weaker opponents and played reasonable against this strong opponent argentina was just a tad smarter and better but collectively we worked hard it took too long for us to gel as a team now i can see the first signs but its too late were going home
4962576 with a bit of luck we would have won its sad but we didnt i do feel we can say farewell with our chins up the concentration and mentality were fine the result let us down
4962577 i was born out in the countryside of a rather non southern state in the south
4962578 mama why did you get such pretty locks like firefly and i get this straw hair

4962601 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got over excited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
4962602 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online after math by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
4962603 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors

4962632 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4962633 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4962634 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country

4962653 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4962654 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4962655 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4962656 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida

4962665 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4962666 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4962667 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4962668 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4962669 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4962670 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate

4962683 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4962684 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4962685 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4962686 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

4962709 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4962710 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4962711 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
4962712 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4962713 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4962714 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4962715 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4962716 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4962717 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4962718 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4962719 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4962720 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4962721 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4962722 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4962723 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4962724 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4962725 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4962728 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4962729 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4962730 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4962731 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4962732 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4962733 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4962734 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4962735 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4962736 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4962737 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4962738 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4962739 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4962740 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4962741 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4962742 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4962743 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4962744 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

4962751 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

4962789 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4962790 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4962791 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4962792 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4962793 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4962794 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4962795 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4962796 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4962797 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4962798 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4962799 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4962800 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4962801 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4962802 it is easier for the human being to make himself the dictator of all other creatures and of nature
4962803 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4962804 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4962805 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4962806 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4962807 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4962808 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4962809 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4962810 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4962811 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4962812 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4962813 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4962814 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4962815 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4962816 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4962817 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4962818 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4962819 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4962820 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4962821 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4962822 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4962823 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4962824 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4962825 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4962826 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4962827 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4962828 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4962829 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4962830 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4962831 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4962832 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4962833 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4962834 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4962835 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4962836 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4962837 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4962838 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4962839 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4962840 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4962841 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4962842 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4962843 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4962844 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4962845 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4962846 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4962847 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4962848 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4962849 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4962850 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4962851 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4962852 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4962853 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4962854 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4962855 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4962856 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4962857 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4962858 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4962859 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4962860 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4962861 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4962862 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4962863 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4962864 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4962865 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4962866 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4962867 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4962868 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4962869 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4962870 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4962871 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4962872 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4962873 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4962874 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4962875 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4962876 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4962877 the 33 year old la galaxy star is expected to arrive on top of a red double decker bus a trademark london transport and will then kick a football into the crowd to celebrate

4962894 i dont think saakashvili is doing very good things because he knew russia has very big power and he knew we cant win with russia
4962895 we hope that it will work because the whole progressive population of the world supports georgia and understands what is the real reason for this conflict
4962896 war and blood is not our purpose we just want peace and our territories back

4962900 the archdiocese has not contacted me in any way shape or form
4962901 i dont know what the allegations were but as a practicing catholic i was not happy with the way the church handled the sexual abuse scandal
4962902 when it relates to an older child teenagers the recidivism is significantly less
4962903 i think you should still be concerned thats the reality of the situation
4962904 im glad they were able to implement all the recommendations we made
4962905 that would not be the right thing to do if they stayed a part of the church then we could monitor them
4962906 if nothing else a lesson has been learned we all have to be vigilant to keep our kids safe

4962913 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4962914 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4962915 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4962923 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4962924 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4962925 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4962926 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4962933 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4962934 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4962935 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4962943 los jueces han dicho que deben aportarse pruebas para levantar ese velo de apariencias

4962952 a m me espanta que en am rica latina a pesar de los flagrantes ejemplos de populismo y autoritarismo haya sectores que todav a piensan que se socialismo autoritario puede ser el camino
4962953 es una ceguera que hay que combatir de manera clara recordando lo que significa para un pueblo equivocarse en t rminos de corrupci n en violencia en restricci n de las libertades en frustraci n

4962959 the person is deceased and the search has now been called off the spokesman said
4962960 it may be at their instance that simi organised their camp at wagamon the kerala police intends to question them to get details about their activities here
4962961 we are keeping a close watch on people visiting the district the forest cover and the hilly terrain could be the reason why they selected the spot for the training camp
4962962 the purpose behind setting up the surveillance system is to keep a constant vigil at the entry points and also maintain visual records of those who cross the border
4962963 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4962964 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4962965 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4962966 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4962967 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4962968 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4962969 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4962970 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4962971 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4962972 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4962973 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4962974 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4962975 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4962976 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4962977 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4962978 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4962980 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4962981 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care

4962983 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4962984 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4962985 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4962986 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4962987 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4962988 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4962989 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4963029 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4963030 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4963031 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4963032 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4963033 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4963034 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4963035 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4963036 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4963037 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4963038 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4963039 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4963040 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4963041 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4963042 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4963043 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4963044 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4963045 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4963046 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4963047 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4963048 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4963049 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4963050 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4963051 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4963052 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4963053 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4963054 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4963055 just so you all know we did set a record
4963056 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4963057 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4963058 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4963059 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4963060 we have found that a lot of the initial reports that we have received on things going on in georgia have not been accurate our latest information for example is that the commercial port at poti is intact and usable and we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade
4963061 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4963062 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4963063 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4963064 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4963065 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4963066 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4963067 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4963068 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4963069 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4963070 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4963071 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4963072 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4963073 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4963074 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4963075 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4963076 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4963077 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4963078 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4963079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4963080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4963081 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4963082 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4963083 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4963084 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4963085 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4963086 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4963087 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4963088 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4963089 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4963090 the film is a classic and needed realistic background to support the script when you compare the budget of this film with tamil or telgu film it is still much smaller
4963091 in our industry it is the first time that so much money have been invested on shooting locales and international artists this is also the first south indian film entirely was shot in uk

4963125 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4963126 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4963127 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4963128 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4963129 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

4963137 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4963138 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4963139 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4963140 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4963141 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4963142 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4963213 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

4963230 we know from history that trickle down economics doesnt work
4963231 but when you hand the average person just a few hundred dollars its life altering they spend the money on things they need and want and that money moves up the economic ladder reaching everyone above through their businesses that are now making more sales to more people
4963232 to bolster the sagging economy our leaders essentially borrowed money to hand taxpayers checks for 600 each and it worked
4963233 but this kind of stunt never works for long and borrowing money to bolster the economy is simply stupid what we need is a way to give the average person 600 1200 even 2 000 or more every month and ive figured out how to do it

4963238 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4963239 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4963240 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4963241 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4963242 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4963243 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4963244 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4963245 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4963246 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4963247 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4963248 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4963249 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4963250 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4963251 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

4963256 weve had that happen they just stop working and die off
4963257 were trying to understand what is going on inside this brain material that could have direct implications for human health
4963258 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
4963259 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
4963260 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
4963261 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
4963262 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
4963263 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
4963264 if this kind of work can make a 1 per cent difference to the life of an alzheimers patient it will be worth it

4963269 the tv centre in gori has been blown up and they are now broadcasting russian radio
4963270 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
4963271 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure

4963278 and i thought i had a chance to do it coach bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through a lot of hard work its been fun
4963279 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4963280 hes not from another planet he from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now hes just an average swimmer but he has come back to this time to mop up
4963281 he is the greatest sportsman ever to walk the planet
4963282 just a normal person but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
4963283 he doesnt want to just beat you he wants to destroy you
4963284 well never really know the answer to questions like that
4963285 but however you rank them michael cant be far down the list
4963286 there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation plus hes a fantastic competitor mentally tough and someone who appears to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
4963287 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
4963288 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4963289 i hate to compare swimmers to players in the nba or nfl
4963290 but i will say that theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the field
4963291 we are breaking records that are 20 30 and nearly 50 years old
4963292 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4963293 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4963294 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

4963311 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4963312 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4963313 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4963317 all the generic ballot questions in the polls show voters want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want obama
4963318 he hasnt closed the sale every historical fact says he should be farther ahead than he is
4963319 obama lost the summer and part of it was he got arrogant and overreached he started talking about transition planning and going to all these red states like montana where he has no chance
4963320 a lot of americans were left scratching their heads thinking why isnt he talking to me
4963321 if he wants to win mccain has no choice but to go negative on obama
4963322 the fight is for the independents about 20 percent of the electorate
4963323 for mccain its the ties to bush and the desire for change and its obamas age inexperience and race theres enough to give people pause with each of them
4963324 wir aus der energiewirtschaft erleben stellvertretend f r viele andere branchen ein klima der handlungsangst alles was wir vorhaben was wir planen was wir versuchen wollen wird mit deutschem perfektionsdrang blockiert nicht von gesetzen sondern von den herzen der menschen es herrscht ein emotionaler konsens in dieser gesellschaft dass jegliches handeln meiner branche teufelswerk ist der protest ist eine boomende gesellschaftliche ausdrucksform ein happening das ber alle schichten und klassen hinweg gemeinsamkeit stiftet das ist sch n aber es erleichtert das f hren von unternehmen nicht schon gar nicht im energie sektor morgen kann es eine andere branche betreffen am ende bleibt unternehmerisches handeln ist praktisch unm glich
4963325 es gab zeiten in meinem leben da habe ich tats chlich an ideale wie die freiheit des unternehmers geglaubt seitdem es zu meinen aufgaben geh rt langfristig energie zu erzeugen bin ich recht ern chtert denn freiheit gilt wenig oder nichts vielmehr halten wir fest am ist zustand am standard das ist der zentrale begriff unserer tage standard der standard scheint alle risiken auszuschlie en er gibt sicherheit standards m ssen sie als unternehmer als politiker als professor unbedingt halten aber er darf praktisch nichts kosten
4963326 uns energieversorgern wurde gelegentlich auch durchaus zu recht ber jahre hinweg vorgeworfen wir seien unbeweglich und wollten nur unsere alten m hlen auspressen energie unternehmen das waren die standardverwalter die besitzstandswahrer schlechthin nun wollen wir uns bewegen wir wollen neues versuchen aber man l sst uns nicht das ist ein kapitaler fehler denn neues kann nur entstehen wenn man eben diese standards bisweilen aufgibt
4963327 wir wollen g nstigen strom eine hohe versorgungssicherheit und m glichst geringe co2 emissionen wenn wir die g ngigen verfahren der stromgewinnung auf diese drei bedingungen untersuchen ergibt sich folgendes die kernkraft liefert g nstigen sicheren strom und belastet das klima wenig aber deutschland will den ausstieg die braunkohle ist der einzige rohstoff den wir in nennenswertem umfang und zu g nstigen gewinnungskosten in deutschland besitzen strom daraus ist g nstig und sicher aber die emissions bilanz ist nicht optimal manche sehen das heil deshalb in gaskraftwerken erdgas aber ist wie erd l ein fossiler brennstoff es ist mindestens genau so preissensibel und muss in gro em umfang importiert werden bleiben sonne wasser wind doch unser netz ist nicht auf die schwankungen eingestellt die ein unberechenbarer lieferant wie der wind nun mal mit sich bringt neue leitungen in deutschland leider sehr schwierig durchzusetzen

4963346 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4963347 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4963348 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4963349 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4963350 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4963351 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4963352 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4963353 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4963354 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4963355 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4963356 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4963357 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4963358 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4963359 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4963360 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4963361 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4963362 we thought that playing japan would be very difficult but we had a lot of confidence and we made good preparations particularly for the doubles match
4963363 so we put all our efforts into preparing for this contest and im really satisfied with the result
4963364 i think we gave our best effort so theres no regrets
4963365 its the last olympics for our head coach japan has never won a medal in table tennis so we really wanted it
4963366 i think that after losing yesterday to germany the damage was done our players are still young and relatively inexperienced so they could not readjust quickly
4963367 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4963368 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4963369 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4963370 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4963371 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4963372 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4963375 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4963376 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4963377 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4963378 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4963393 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4963394 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4963395 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4963396 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4963397 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4963398 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4963399 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4963400 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4963401 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4963402 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4963403 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4963404 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4963405 who are open to doing something on the production side
4963406 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4963407 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4963408 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4963409 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4963410 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4963411 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4963412 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4963413 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4963414 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4963415 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4963416 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4963417 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4963418 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4963419 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4963420 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4963421 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4963422 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4963423 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4963424 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4963425 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4963426 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4963427 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4963428 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4963429 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4963430 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4963431 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4963432 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4963433 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4963434 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4963435 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4963436 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4963437 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4963438 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4963439 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4963440 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4963441 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4963442 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4963443 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4963444 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4963445 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4963446 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4963447 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4963448 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4963449 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4963450 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4963451 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4963452 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4963453 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4963454 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4963455 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4963456 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4963463 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4963464 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4963465 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4963466 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4963467 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4963468 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4963469 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through

4963484 it was very upsetting and i dont understand how they can allow this to happen theyve acted like little hitlers and i think they should apologise
4963485 clearly we are happy to assist people who fall behind with payments when we can however we are not able to do so unless we are informed by residents their families or ward members

4963507 i could be the one sitting out this election and helping obama not get elected
4963508 but i need to be able to get out and do all i can he has a strong basic message that we need to hear and i believe in it
4963509 i really thought more of john mccain but the tone of his campaign really bothers me
4963510 i took john mccain at his word that he would run a respectful campaign about the issues i dont mind a debate but the mockery is too much maybe they are the only options they have
4963511 he sat down with the six of us and began asking questions and i knew he was listening
4963512 the message i walked away with is that he cant do it himself and everyone has a responsibility
4963513 i honestly feel that this country our government and leaders has not communicated to the american public how much of an impact that being in a global economy is deciding so many things for us
4963514 things have to a change a lot and he makes people believe they can do it
4963515 were like ostriches putting our heads in the sand hoping the next crisis will pass
4963516 its a vicious cycle were in and more drilling for a finite resource like oil may not be the smartest solution
4963517 i accept the fact that both mccain and obama are career politicians who promise you the moon
4963518 i spent a lot of time in the business world and no one person has the answers
4963519 of course you need to change your mind how can you get anywhere if you dont
4963520 i think we had to close it 30 days this year
4963521 in our 19 years of business we have never come close to being closed that much
4963522 its nice we dont have to irrigate but on the down side right now our low lying fields are getting flooded some of the crops are dying
4963523 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4963524 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4963525 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4963526 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4963527 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4963528 the findings of the israeli investigation are confusing and offer no convincing explanation of the circumstances that led to the reuters cameramans death
4963529 only an impartial analysis of what happened would be able to prevent this kind of tragedy from recurring instead of reassuring the press the israeli military is fostering an unacceptable climate of fear and danger
4963530 if journalists are wearing flak jackets keeping a reasonable distance from the belligerents and clearly displaying press markings there should be a change in the behaviour of the soldiers in areas where civilians including journalists are present
4963531 im just really relieved to get back safe and sound after the ordeal up there
4963532 and im just glad its all over and im looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight
4963533 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4963534 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
4963535 its been brilliant this campaign has been about pure perfection and were just an awesome team
4963536 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them

4963545 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4963546 the opportunity presented itself and i was asked to do this job its an honor and a pleasure and its a great challenge for me
4963547 it was a big part of our success last year as a team and i know theyre going to continue to do that to win we have to perform well defensively
4963548 each defensive call each formation guys have to understand in this defense this is where i fit this is where i need to be
4963549 if you can get 11 guys to understand where they need to fit on the run and be consistent doing that using technique and fundamentals that gives you the biggest chance
4963550 last year he would be running around the field like a chicken with his head cut off screaming and yelling at everybody
4963551 but this year he is calmer trying to see the whole picture
4963552 there was never a day that i coached at ohio state i felt like i could slack off
4963553 you had to be pretty much on top of your game all the time recruiting was year round and the big ten was fierce competition that was a good experience for me
4963554 im not sure thats true i was a better bargain when i was at ysu
4963555 the way i saw it living with him was that his success was the difference he made in lives
4963556 and thats what we hope we can do and we take it seriously
4963557 theyve harped on it since the end of last season to the offseason to now
4963558 we need to change that if we want to win games particularly with the schedule weve got
4963559 we cant do anything but go up from this point
4963560 you dont want to play scared but you want to make sure that nothing careless happens and thats what were trying to avoid the careless turnovers
4963561 he didnt look like a freshman he has good presence for a young guy
4963562 it looks to me like hes going to be very very good hes got extraordinary ability
4963563 i think you factor any way you can to have all of your possible weapons available to become as good as you can become and most especially at the quarterback position
4963564 total command of what were doing he just looks the part of the returning quarterback from a good team
4963565 each and every time i go out there i feel that much better about myself im still working on the little things and trying to do it right all the time
4963566 all right its not my fault what do you want me to do im told to go play i go play
4963567 a lot of teams from the big ten went to bowl games so just playing our regular season games prepares us for bowl games
4963568 but everyone in america wants to see big titan clashes they want to see the best against the best theyve seen us do well in our conference and they want to see how we fare against the nations best
4963569 if you look at where we were 40 years ago i was looking at the schedules from 1966 we had far fewer games and far fewer mismatches really sturdy kinds of opponents
4963570 even if you maybe take a look at that 20 years ago in the late 80s they were stronger schedules than they are today
4963571 our fans are not as likely to buy season tickets to come watch us play lesser opponents
4963572 if the buckeyes go out to usc and win the game obviously it sets them up
4963573 but if they lose and compete well like if theyre no 3 in the nation where are you going to drop them to no 5 or 6

4963640 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4963641 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4963642 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature

4963677 the n h marine debris to energy project is a successful joint venture between public and private organizations who have recognized the need to mitigate marine debris on the shore underwater and out in the ocean
4963678 by looking at the big picture and taking the time to identify and monitor marine debris we can gain a better understanding of what makes up ocean based debris develop plans to implement a cleanup program and help create a solution through education and outreach
4963679 what we have discovered is that derelict fishing gear and other marine debris in the ocean and along the coast has the potential to impact a broad range of the marine ecosystem from the marine industries that use coastal waterways and beaches to the organisms that reside within them
4963680 marine debris is a hazard to water craft navigation and can pose a threat to life and property when encountered at sea
4963681 this project was started to continue the important cleanup efforts and help put a stop to ocean based debris
4963682 we are aware that the majority of debris found at beach cleanups in new hampshire comes from ocean based sources so if we can enlist the support and help of the fishermen to help bring in what they find at sea waste management can help them dispose of it properly
4963683 we are very proud to be a part of this great effort to help reduce the amount of debris collect data about what makes up the debris and provide training and outreach on how to best handle marine debris in the future
4963684 were happy to report that getting the help of local fishermen was not a tough sell
4963685 it really is a benefit to them and their livelihood to do everything they can to diminish marine debris and keep the oceans as clean as possible
4963686 by encouraging them to bring lost gear found at sea and by locating these dumpsters and recycling bins at a convenient location this effort can certainly diminish the debris which is potentially harmful to wildlife people vessels and the economy
4963687 this is the first time fishermen have had a place to deposit derelict fishing gear
4963688 we certainly hope this project and educational programs developed can be used as templates for other areas in developing data collection procedures and outreach strategies for marine debris reduction
4963689 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4963690 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
4963691 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4963692 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4963693 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4963694 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4963695 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom id rather do the job myself
4963696 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4963697 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4963698 we are not staying home with our children by default
4963699 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4963700 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
4963701 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4963702 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4963703 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4963704 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year

4963706 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
4963707 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals

4963711 if we are going to manage the ocean we need to understand it and participating in programs like this helps me as a fisherman to understand what is going on
4963712 it also helps the scientists learn how fishermen do things what knowledge and skills they have everybody learns
4963713 getting the environmental data back from nefsc confirms what i have been seeing in terms of where the fish are
4963714 i can definitely see the trends one degree change in water temperature can mean cod or another species you are fishing are not where you thought they would be
4963715 it isnt always intuitive either sometimes it is colder in waters to the south that you think should be warmer
4963716 the data help fishermen understand why they are catching certain fish at certain places at certain times
4963717 the data these vessels can provide using flounders for fisheries logbook data recording software is more accurate detailed and comprehensive than would be obtained without deploying expensive observers who are part of the northeast fishery observer program
4963718 the fishermen send in their data near real time to nefsc using their vessel monitoring systems vms the data are loaded to our databases and made available to fishermen via the internet to view edit and confirm in less than an hour after a fishing trip has ended
4963719 this allows the industry to ensure that the data received by nmfs are reported as they reported them they have additional control and accountability for the fisheries data they collect
4963720 it is very important to have fishermen involved in the research about their industry
4963721 the only way we are going to get things to improve is to participate in the process i get frustrated at times that things havent moved further forward but at least they are moving in the right direction
4963722 it is all about cooperation scientists need and want data about the ocean and fishermen can help provide that
4963723 the industry has to trust the scientists enough to want to provide accurate data and the scientists have to trust the industry enough to believe in the quality of the data
4963724 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
4963725 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
4963726 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it
4963727 we would plan and find the resources to do it
4963728 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
4963729 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around

4963821 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4963822 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4963823 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4963824 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4963825 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4963826 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4963827 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4963828 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4963829 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4963830 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4963831 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4963832 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
4963833 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
4963834 there were a lot of things to appreciate in the performance tonight in that we didnt just pack it in and say lets go home
4963835 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
4963836 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
4963837 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
4963838 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work

4963850 por supuesto que la inestabilidad les preocupa a los paquistan es pero tampoco les interesa a los aliados occidentales de pakist n
4963851 los occidentales est n inc modos con la situaci n pues para ellos ninguno de los posibles remplazantes de musharraf representa la continuidad
4963852 se dan cuenta de que la presidencia fue estable solamente cuando los militares estuvieron en el poder o cuando estuvo en manos de un gobierno fuerte como el que pakist n tuvo en los a os 70 con zulfikar al bhutto
4963853 problemas del sistema pol tico paquistan y que corresponde a los paquistan es resolverlos

4963864 there were times where there were more bankruptcies but i dont know if ive ever seen so many people prepared to walk away from their houses
4963865 because of these no income verification no asset loan products that were popular people have no equity and never did
4963866 even in the real estate downturn in the 90s you didnt have people with no equity in their homes
4963867 theres no way i should have been approved for loans that big
4963868 but i guess its not for me im not buying property again ever again
4963869 people will eat out less buy fewer flat screen tvs take fewer vacations
4963870 ive seen so many people just tightening their belts to the absolute limit theres simply no disposable income for a lot of people anymore
4963871 sixteen months ago we couldnt get close to some of these buildings because all people cared about was price and not anyones ability to actually close a deal
4963872 we are seeing people who wouldnt or couldnt compete before getting back in the game
4963873 we are seeing better capitalized players institutional players players who dont live on the edge in the deals
4963874 we are going to be in a position to take advantage of what is going on in the market
4963875 whats more important is where prices will be in five or six years we think they will be higher

4963880 i felt like i ran the second half strong and i was picking up places and thats the way i like to feel at the end i feel fine thats a solid time its not my best time

4963882 i didnt want to leave anything at there and as you can see i didnt i hit the wall i guess
4963883 that was great i saw them screaming and i waved but i just wanted to throw up though i wanted to throw up from 35km on

4963970 local government is supposed to be the closet form of government to the community having an active web presence helps bridge the gap between the council and the community
4963971 it is another tool for the community to use in addition to mobile phones and email
4963972 it also enables young people who may be disengaged with the community to have their say in a way they feel comfortable
4963973 today we had a nice little rain with wind up to 20 knots its a lot like sailing in britain
4963974 but the last downwind was a little scary i kept telling myself dont capsize dont capsize
4963975 this feeling is truly amazing and its a massive relief
4963976 when we crossed the line the three of us just looked at one another i cant describe the feeling because you just know that youre the best in the whole world at what you do

4963980 the construction programs are just so enormous that you have skills shortages
4963981 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4963982 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4963983 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4963984 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4963985 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4963986 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4963987 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through

4964017 yan zi and zheng jie of china beat ukraines alona and kateryna bondarenko for the bronze 6 2 6 2 the singles final began with only about a thousand spectators in the 10 000 seat stadium but it was mostly full by the end 2 1 2 hours later
4964018 clint bolton was exceptional in goal but thats what keepers are there for
4964019 but in the second half we more than took the game to melbourne and maybe could have come out of it with something
4964020 melbourne coach ernie merrick felt his team warranted a better result for their performance
4964021 we felt as though we should have taken all three points particularly with the chances we had in the first half
4964022 even in the second half we created chances but to come here and say were really disappointed not to take all three points speaks volumes for how we played
4964023 we talked about the fact that they had a few missing and a lot of the boys in the central coast team had a point to prove
4964024 when you play teams like that it is always difficult if you dont take your chances early and score so the longer the game went the more we invited them into it
4964025 we thought that playing japan would be very difficult but we had a lot of confidence and we made good preparations particularly for the doubles match
4964026 so we put all our efforts into preparing for this contest and im really satisfied with the result
4964027 the bronze medal contest sunday was a repeat of a first stage group match which the koreans also won 3 0
4964028 i think we gave our best effort so theres no regrets
4964029 its the last olympics for our head coach japan has never won a medal in table tennis so we really wanted it
4964030 fukuhara matched up with koreas sole attacking player dang ye seo and the two had some fast rallies that drew
4964031 i think that after losing yesterday to germany the damage was done

4964033 wir sollten jetzt weniger sprechen und mehr arbeiten ich habe noch nie fans erlebt die so viele patzer verzeihen und trotzdem hinter der mannschaft stehen wie hier bei santos ich kann sie nur dazu begl ckw nschen
4964034 wir k nnen best tigen dass die kammer zur beilegung von streitigkeiten im fall des spielers adrian mutu gegen den fc chelsea england eine entscheidung getroffen hat von der beide parteien in kenntnis gesetzt wurden
4964035 die entsch digungsforderung des fc chelsea aufgrund des bruchs eines am 12 august 2003 zwischen beiden parteien geschlossenen vertrages wurde teilweise anerkannt der spieler adrian mutu wurde zur zahlung von eur 17 173 990 an den fc chelsea verpflichtet gem art 63 der fifa statuten kann gegen diesen entscheid vor dem unabh ngigen schiedsgericht cas court of arbitration for sport berufung eingelegt werden
4964036 ich habe ihm gesagt dass wir ein angebot von chelsea ber 32 millionen euro haben und robinho weg m chte
4964037 das bisher ausgehandelte ist gut f r den spieler aber noch nicht das was wir wollen
4964038 die berliner haben einen repr sentanten hier in brasilien der ihre interessen vertritt wir stehen bereit f r ein neues angebot von ihm
4964039 wir k nnen es kaum erwarten nach den sch nen momenten der vergangenen saison endlich zu unseren fans zur ckzufinden
4964040 ich bin kein verfechter der theorie nur zu arsenal zu reisen um den tag zu genie en wir m ssen versuchen das spiel zu gewinnen
4964041 der hsv wird eine schwere aufgabe aber wir werden alles daran setzen dass die hamburger erstmals in der allianz arena verlieren
4964042 wir sehen keinen anlass f r ver nderungen im conti vorstand
4964043 edna i have good news and bad news the good news is youre being discharged since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of another patient i have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness the bad news is ralph the patient you saved hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom i am so sorry but hes dead
4964044 it album art survived from the lp to the cd but if that becomes obsolete then i guess album art wont exist i think it would be a big loss
4964045 the things that pop music was there to do for us have all been done theres nothing to rail against now
4964046 when i was 15 in the north west of england the record cover to me was like a picture window to another world seeing an andy warhol illustration on a velvet underground album was a revelation it was the art of your generation true pop art
4964047 with downloads and everything its just killing the whole art side of music stone dead to be quite honest unless you have 20 20 vision its very hard to read anything written on a cd cover there was something very special about vinyl albums its a great shame
4964048 iconic sleeves can help to sell significant amounts of records
4964049 if a band has put effort into the music why not devote that same meticulousness to the package
4964050 you are creating a sleeve that you want to be as iconic as possible its got to work when its a thumbnail on amazon its got to work on the shelves at tesco and on the racks at hmv
4964051 with bands being able to sell music online it frees designers from the constraints of retailers
4964052 but now what is fantastic is that we see bands selling music online where they can sell either a digital download or offer the option to buy a special packaging version of the product that can be mailed to them that can be any shape any size and any format
4964053 im sorry for waking you up but you have to get here to get your free gold
4964054 im sorry i dont have any more time if you decide you are interested in making money on the internet with a publicly traded company call me
4964055 we have a very important conference call next sunday night at 8 pm cst that will go over new updates in ytb you have seen the dream with ytb you owe it to yourself to get all this new information
4964056 life seems to say to us here are the raw materials your creativity and 24 hours to use it
4964057 will this help me reach my lifes goals is this worth my time
4964058 ytb has to be singled out because it faced another year of controversy because of the structure of its business losing iata and royal caribbean accreditation
4964059 gas prices are too high no one can afford a home based business so im not going to talk to anyone
4964060 gas is increasing and expected to go to 7 per gallon is your income at your current job increasing in the same proportion you need to make some extra income from home in a ytb business and offset that increase in fuel costs with tax deductions did you know that the irs just raised the mileage deduction to 58 1 2 cents per mile
4964061 they make too much money they wouldnt be interested in a home based business
4964062 the economy is in such terrible shape they are so stressed out about it i cant talk to them about ytb
4964063 my home based business is doing very well im looking for 7 people who are looking to make a change in their financial situation i want to help 7 people make about 31000 over the next 12 months
4964064 you can help me i wish i had gotten into that business when you first talked to me but i thought i missed the opportunity
4964065 my home based business is going very well i feel like i owe it to you as my friend to give you more information about it can you take 10 minutes to watch a video on my website
4964066 to keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it
4964067 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4964068 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4964069 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4964070 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4964071 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4964072 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4964073 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4964074 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4964075 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4964076 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4964077 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4964078 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4964079 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4964080 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4964081 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4964082 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4964083 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4964084 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4964085 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4964086 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4964087 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4964088 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4964089 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4964090 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4964091 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4964092 this is a planning took where all things are going
4964093 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4964094 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4964095 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4964096 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4964097 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4964098 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4964099 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4964100 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4964101 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4964102 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4964103 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4964104 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4964105 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4964106 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4964107 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4964108 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4964109 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4964110 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4964111 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4964112 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4964113 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4964114 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4964115 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4964116 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4964117 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4964118 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4964119 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4964120 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4964121 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4964122 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4964123 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4964124 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4964125 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4964126 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4964127 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4964128 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4964129 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4964130 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4964131 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4964132 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4964133 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4964134 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4964135 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4964136 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4964137 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4964138 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4964139 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4964140 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4964141 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4964142 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4964143 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4964144 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4964145 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4964146 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4964147 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4964148 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4964149 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4964150 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4964151 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4964156 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4964157 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4964158 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4964159 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4964160 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4964161 what we presented to the provincial board was for sc 54 only we are already on our third year all scs have a seven year exploration period with an option to extend for three years

4964163 ayaw nating isipin ng mga bisita na pinagsasamantalahan natin sila
4964164 to check that the money for our indigenous people or communities are given to them
4964165 i understand from former energy secretary rafael lotilla that the claim of palawan had been used up by dbm to cover up the national governments fiscal deficit they have devised this scheme and lined up the pork barrel of our congressmen and local leaders so that they will agree to a compromise
4964166 because the dbm has yet to come up with a computation on how much money is still available to palawan
4964167 and that is all palawan is going to get because all of the money that is being disputed had already been used to cover up the deficit
4964168 at first i didnt want to sign this petition but this scheme is outright panloloko na sa tao it appears that for the sake of expediency our local officials have gotten into this deal
4964169 even the securitization scheme that is provided in the deal is dubious no less than secretary lotilla admits that no bank will take this as guarantee for securitization
4964170 i will give you all the lovin you crave when im awake but dont go waking me up just to meet your needs buster
4964171 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4964172 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4964173 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4964174 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4964175 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4964176 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4964177 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4964178 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4964179 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4964180 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4964181 you have value on the ground more than you spent

4964226 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied
4964227 it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4964228 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4964229 he was a really good lad i cant believe this has happened
4964230 he had everything to live for and was a normal young lad into football
4964231 i am still taking it in and trying to find out exactly what happened all his friends are stunned
4964232 connor was a member of a loving family though he was known to the police but not for anything serious
4964233 as of yet there is no motive but it is very early days

4964245 this major milestone in the lhc project will be covered live by international broadcasters uk media organisations will be at cern and at a simultaneous media event in london
4964246 how did our universe come to be the way it is
4964247 the universe started with a big bang but we dont fully understand how or why it developed the way it did the lhc will let us see how matter behaved a tiny fraction of a second after the big bang researchers have some ideas of what to expect but also expect the unexpected
4964248 many physicists think the universe has more dimensions than the four space and time we are aware of will the lhc bring us evidence of new dimensions
4964249 gravity does not fit comfortably into the current descriptions of forces used by physicists it is also very much weaker than the other forces one explanation for this may be that our universe is part of a larger multi dimensional reality and that gravity can leak into other dimensions making it appear weaker the lhc may allow us to see evidence of these extra dimensions for example the production of mini black holes which blink into and out of existence in a tiny fraction of a second

4964323 we hold dear the firm view that robert mugabe and mswati iii are not legitimate leaders of their various countries
4964324 they cannot claim any amount of legitimacy to rule their countries for they have not been democratically elected by the peoples of their countries
4964325 therefore as representatives of civil society we condemn the behavior of these two leaders and take it upon ourselves to expose them and their unacceptable behavior before the eyes of the world
4964326 they are obviously the poorest and the most vulnerable among those displaced we find out that those who are living in those tented camps have usually been evicted many times from public buildings that they had been occupying illegally and because they are a small number they probably have not received the assistance they deserve especially considering that these camps are sometimes in fairly remote locations and usually are set up in barren empty land

4964332 nolan told me that were going to take a system wide new approach to pitching in the offseason
4964333 were talking about training development conditioning he doesnt believe in putting a limit of 100 pitches a game on pitchers he wants our pitchers to be stronger and better conditioned throughout the system
4964334 dustin was consistent with what they were looking for the whole time and i explained why it was something we werent interested in doing
4964335 its never a piece of cake we had a player who wanted to play for us and an organization that was committed from top to bottom to get this thing done
4964336 i remember last september we were getting on him saying you have to go the other way in batting practice
4964337 ian told us i dont like going that way but this year hes been doing it since spring training and look at the results
4964338 the stuff is there but it needs to be refined
4964339 i saw him up to 94 mph on the fastball with good life and his curveball is a real downer with a pretty sharp break his delivery is solid and hes aggressive and really hes got everything you want to see in a kid his age
4964340 hes so athletic and thin and not a lot of pitchability right now but i can see it coming you add the physical maturing thats clearly still to come and he could really turn into something

4964346 it was a real struggle for me because i didnt feel like myself out there

4964368 once a child goes through pre k hell be ready for kindergarten preschoolers are not ready to sit down for long periods of time they need to be up and moving
4964369 the emphasis is on learning language literacy skills becoming acquainted with books and learning letters but not memorizing the alphabet
4964370 we want them to be exposed to books and words but theyre not expected to learn to read and write in preschool our job is to get them ready for reading and writing
4964371 but we do have west virginia content standards for preschool
4964372 they dont need a lot of fancy things crayons or blocks for fine motor skills let them run and kick balls
4964373 children learn through play we dont say today were going to learn the letter a as we read well write the letters in a word or their name the childs name is the first word we start with and well talk about the letters in their name
4964374 its important for parents if they can afford it to buy books as presents for their children
4964375 those are nice but give them finger paints crayons coloring books
4964376 were supposed to be ready for the child the child is not supposed to be ready for us
4964377 we accept them where they are its our job to move them up that continuum
4964378 every child comes in with different abilities there is no cut and dried fast answer but there are a lot of things parents can do to ease them into kindergarten
4964379 set the alarm clock and have the backpack clothes and lunch ready the night before this will ease the stress so there is no panic in the morning
4964380 when a child sees stress in his parents its amplified in his mind being organized is a big factor it calms and reassures the child
4964381 instead of telling the child to walk faster which creates anxiety leave early and take a leisurely walk with your childs pace and youll avoid the child potentially missing the bus and arriving at school late
4964382 writing this on an index card and putting it the backpack goes a long way in helping the school staff if a child misses the bus or gets panicked that card can be a life saver
4964383 parents are very concerned and rightfully so if their child is not at the bus stop a call from the school is a timely reassurance
4964384 write their entire name on personal items such as lunch boxes backpacks and jackets
4964385 then it becomes a habit and part of the routine youll always be able to find it
4964386 historically that is the single most important thing you can do read to your child every day even if its only for 15 20 minutes my parents did that for me and i did that for my children
4964387 work with your child on alphabet and number recognition counting objects
4964388 especially things they can handle appeal to their senses take a candy bar and break it into 12 pieces they can feel the smoothness and smell the aroma of the chocolate and if they count correctly maybe they can eat it too
4964389 work with writing their first name with scented crayons appeal to as many senses as you can
4964390 consistency for children at this age gives them comfort praise them and reassure them to help feel a sense of security
4964391 kindergarten should be fun children at that age are naturally curious parents may feel overwhelmed with the number of questions but thats how they learn
4964392 you may not know the answers its ok to say you dont know but lets find out together
4964393 this may mean asking the teacher or maybe grandparents its a great way to connect with an older generation and its a great way to model for a child that you learn by asking others
4964394 she likes word games like hangman anything that helps with letter identification she reads stop signs to identify letters she plays games on the internet
4964395 shes able to memorize sandra boynton books and goes through them on her own
4964396 like if you have two and take away one how many do you have
4964397 they had a lesson on space and it was unbelievable what she knew how many planets the smallest and biggest i was impressed
4964398 its helping her with time we talk about months its difficult for kids her age to have a concept of time yesterday and today she uses interchangeably so we say the babys coming after halloween after christmas after valentines day
4964399 first we enrolled her in a pre k program twice a week in preparation for the transition to kindergarten
4964400 pre k is just a preparation for kindergarten it has a curriculum but not like kindergarten kindergarten is more structured and curriculum based in pre k theyre allowed nap time in kindergarten they have a rest time but not actually nap time
4964401 i think it will be harder on me than it is on her i dont want to think about it
4964402 but all she does it talk about it shes done with pre k and shes going to kindergarten
4964403 but she can read dick and jane biscuit the dog she cant pick up a book to read but shes getting the hang of it
4964404 i tell her that and she says yes i am
4964405 im excited for her but in a way im sad too but i guess thats common when youre sending your baby to school
4964406 shes very self motivated she brings things to me to let her do she loves to write and draw and asks me how to spell words and write letters and numbers she loves to practice writing her name and numbers
4964407 that helped tremendously they have so much time to spend on the little things that i wouldnt even think about like sensory things
4964408 at home were always focused on dont make a mess but at day care they wanted them to do that to develop sensory skills
4964409 the first day of kindergarten will be much harder on me than her
4964410 i have to plan ahead and schedule things so i can get one child to one school and the other to another and organize homework and extracurricular activities
4964411 at the store ill ask what color an apple is i read labels with her im a dietitian so we look at foods and packaging and colors
4964412 shes always been very knowledgeable about colors and shapes shell tell me before i even ask her thats partly to do with being in preschool and daycare
4964413 i know shell love school and everything about it the hard part is letting go shes my last baby going to school
4964414 just go with the flow be really involved with your child and their teacher know whats going on in the classroom ask the teacher to be open with you and communicate with you thats important
4964415 really do not have to pack anything and there is all my stuff waiting for me just like i left it
4964416 they had nothing im pretty sure i learned my work ethic from them they worked so hard for us to have a better life
4964417 they did everything my dad was a carpenter for a while he worked odd jobs then he worked at a saw mill my mom she waitressed and then eventually they owned a small 12 room hotel in hazelton b c which they just sold in may the bulkley valley motel
4964418 i remember leaving for the worlds last year and telling people shes gonna win it this year
4964419 volleyball basketball shes just a phenomenal all round athlete and a phenomenal competitor to have her choose wrestling were really lucky because theres probably a lot of things she could have done

4964439 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4964440 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4964441 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4964442 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4964443 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4964444 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4964445 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him

4964500 does this darkness have a name this cruelty this hatred how did it find us did it steal into our lives or did we seek it out and embrace it what happened to us that we now send our children into the world like we send young men to war hoping for their safe return but knowing that some would be lost along the way when did we lose our way consumed by the shadows swallowed whole by the darkness does this darkness have a name is it your name
4964501 jangan pernah bertanya apa yang telah diberikan negeri ini untuk dirimu tetatp bertanyalah apa yang telah kau berikan untuk negeri ini
4964502 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
4964503 i could see prilukov coming and i knew he was going to have a good back end
4964504 i just did what ever i could to hold him off
4964505 it was really hard to compete on the last day
4964506 the team has been so supportive we really showed what we can do i think were really ecstatic to be canadians right now
4964507 both leaders welcomed the ceasefire agreement and expressed hope russian troops would withdraw quickly from georgian territory
4964508 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4964509 we want them the russians out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometre of its sovereign territory never ever
4964510 has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4964511 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4964512 shorter term applications of the things we have demonstrated i would say we can use it for very high resolution to image tiny objects
4964513 even if you take a very small object and you magnify by say 100 000 you will see a magnified image but you wont see the fine detail you will get a blurred image
4964514 a three dimensional array of electronic elements such as capacitors and inductors the common elements you will find in your radio or televison but with a nanometer scale so that it can interact with light
4964515 the metamaterials achieved by our group have the potential to beat this limit and to image very small objects such as living cells in their natural environment this would be of practical importance for medical science
4964516 we are still learning how to make 3 dimensional metamaterial lenses and how to reduce the effect of losses on imaging resolution
4964517 metamaterials enable for example the development of small multi antenna terminals that are needed in many of these wireless platforms
4964518 moreover metamaterials are very well suited for creating devices that operate at multiple bands which is another immediate requirement in emerging wireless systems
4964519 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4964520 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4964521 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4964522 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4964523 if you want to scare me youre going to have to work a little harder than that
4964524 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius
4964525 i agree now that the words are cliched but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4964526 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4964527 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4964528 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4964529 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4964530 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4964531 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard
4964532 i knew that i had to set the pace set the tone and make sure that i wrestled my match and not just wait around to see what she was going to do
4964533 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian
4964534 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4964535 to see her on the world stage and just doing what she can do and showing everyone it was really emotional
4964536 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
4964537 each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4964538 their commitment to excellence and to achieving the olympic dream truly makes them great sport ambassadors for canada
4964539 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4964540 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4964541 nobody cares who ranks 12th in the world in something

4964548 voor het begin van de spelen wisten we dat het mogelijk was we zijn zelfs nog dicht bij goud geweest maar uiteindelijk mogen we heel blij zijn met zilver
4964549 dat is voor jou een vraag en voor mij een weet
4964550 het is een kwestie van gevoel ik denk dat deze meiden met elkaar de beste prestatie bij de olympische spelen kunnen leveren
4964551 resounding support for legalization however the spread in the yes no percentages was more narrow than in other polls we ve seen
4964552 with all three yes categories totaled 68 percent were in favor of legalization while 32 percent were opposed via two no categories that s a convincing majority but less than the 75 percent 92 percent in favor that we ve seen from other sources
4964553 our poll was different from most on this subject in that it gave options to qualify a yes or no vote
4964554 for starters considering the 17 percent who voted no due to recent scandals it could be argued that as high as 85 percent would be in favor if online gambling was properly regulated
4964555 but it also illustrates that online problems hole card spying in poker likely being the most prominent a reference to recent absolute poker and ultimatebet scandals ed are not going unnoticed
4964556 we also found it interesting that the traditional 15 percent or so that are categorically opposed to online gambling exist even here on a las vegas and gambling site
4964557 the main reason for a yes vote was the basic rights and liberties argument
4964558 the poker player alliance is honored to host this charity poker tournament and looks forward to raising a lot of money for these american heroes
4964559 this is a great opportunity to harness the popularity of the game of poker in order to raise much needed funds for those who have fought to protect our country and our individual freedoms

4964563 i was at the university of michigan on a diving scholarship
4964564 when the 84 trials passed me by i lost my scholarship and my parents said well if you want to keep going to school you have to do it in state
4964565 i kind of always have been where the work is my careers been on this constant linear path of doing musical theater
4964566 it was especially great to see bob and ive watched a lot of archival footage which is great the tony awards the year a chorus line was the opening number i was also fortunate to see a pristine tape of the gala performance that took place when it became broadways longest running show
4964567 i think its important to remember that ultimately the show isnt about him that to me is the biggest trap about playing zach making him too much of a presence hes there as a catalyst for the people in the line
4964568 when he finally comes on stage and becomes more of a human being its kind of a soap opera its written very melodramatically but if it goes too dark it becomes people screaming at each other its not really that im trying to constantly find the balance and walk the tightrope
4964569 hes not an unlikable character but you know being a choreographer and a director is not a popularity contest michael bennett had the incredible talent of making people love him even though he could be really impossible and demanding and game playing someone we might call a borderline personality nowadays you have to let that be present but hes not all one way or the other
4964570 bob lupone played him very dark but this time around bob director bob avian who assisted bennett in the original production wants me to be a little more likable if hes too much of a tyrant we really cant understand what cassie sees in him zach and cassie an aging auditioner are former lovers but if he becomes too warm and fuzzy he loses his authority
4964571 someone asked me what was the difference between playing mike back in 89 and playing zach now i was 24 when i did mike the perfect age for him id just moved to new york now ive been in nine broadway shows and ive lived in new york for 20 years
4964572 im going to be 44 soon im in a whole different place ive got the right experience now for this part
4964573 id ask people who knew him what was michael like they told me he would compartmentalize hed act one way toward one person and a completely different way toward another hed seduce and fragment people
4964574 but everyone who knew him had completely different perspectives so in the end you have to forget about all that and make your own choices
4964575 es muss ein sonntag gewesen sein denn es fiel ein spiel vom lokalverein sporting gij n mit einem formel 1 grand prix auf einen tag zusammen
4964576 its about youre not on the list i was a naughty boy its always fascinated me that idea of finishing your life and then being analyzed on it and this idea runs throughout most religions thats why people blow up buildings because they think theyre going to get lots of virgins i always feel like saying just join a band laughs that is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody eternal damnation i know about this stuff because i studied it i was into it all i know it its still mildly terrifying to me and this is serious
4964577 if it exists should we negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
4964578 defeat it if i am president of the united states my friends i will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell and i will get him
4964579 weve got to drill now and weve got to drill here
4964580 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological position or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4964581 as president i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4964582 john mccain did a very good job very straight forward
4964583 i think barack obama is very likeable and emotional but he skirted the issues the evening definitely cemented my views
4964584 barack obama was just like a regular politician he didnt answer the questions i think john mccain blew him out of the ballpark
4964585 if youve got book sales of 25m then you qualify
4964586 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family then you are middle class or youre poor if youre making more than 250 000 youre doing well
4964587 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
4964588 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4964589 if youre just talking about income how about 5m it doesnt matter because i dont want to raise anyones taxes

4964621 we looked at that 08 19 departure from mytholmroyd but starting it earlier from manchester makes a non compliant turnround for the u nit that comes into manchester to form it arrives in from leeds at 07 37 to form the 07 48 return working this means the times would be too tight and would impact on performance we have to have all timetables performance verified and one of the things we have done with this timetable is increase the ridiculously tight 6 minute tur nrounds we have had at each end that cause unneccesary delay we could do it with the earlier one 07 19 departure from mytholmroyd as it was its first working of the day off manchester but once we get into the day we have issues with earlier workings etc
4964622 we had a rigorous process of selection which involved a paper review of six agencies and
4964623 while the quality of agency we saw was extremely high
4964624 despite some tough questions from the team they exceeded all my expectations with their expertise flair and deep knowledge of the education and skills sector
4964625 were delighted to be working with peter on such an important campaign and really excited about the challenge of establishing the academy at the heart of a new approach to enterprise learning and entrepreneurialism in the uk

4964630 im backing shine because i believe everyone has a hidden talent i had a great passion for tennis when i was younger and i definitely believe that being able to follow my dreams back then has played a big part in giving me the confidence to be successful in business today
4964631 we applaud peter jones national enterprise academy concept with its focus on unlocking the entrepreneurial talents of the nations young people and we look forward to working with the future generation of innovative employees and businesses it aims to encourage
4964632 we are particularly keen on talking to employers of all sizes to ensure that any qualification offered by the national enterprise academy really meets skills needs
4964633 in time we hope to work with employers so that the qualification can be delivered in the workplace as well as through partnerships with other training partners and further education establishments

4964648 we went on the water today hoping to have our best race and we did
4964649 im really proud of it and scott is really proud of it
4964650 the australians had a great push through the middle we pushed back a little bit but congratulations to them they definitely deserved that were very happy with a silver medal today
4964651 this has been a whole different story the whole way along
4964652 today is more satisfaction for having a good piece race and winning a medal rather than atoning for past losses
4964653 it wasnt really part of our thought process going in because thats just un needed pressure
4964654 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point coxswain brian price said of raising his arms near the finish line
4964655 ive been thinking about it ever since said kyle hamilton
4964656 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
4964657 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
4964658 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said brambell
4964659 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4964660 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
4964661 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4964662 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4964663 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
4964664 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
4964665 its also positive that there hasnt been a let up in the publics fascination with the high octane process of setting up and running a successful business
4964666 take the apprentice i love the apprentice its nothing like the real world its completely nuts but compelling totally compelling and the great news is that all this publicity is beginning to have real traction in the approach and ambitions of young people around the country
4964667 one example is the new national enterprise academy which will open its doors early next year to offer a new qualification in enterprise to students over the age of 16 this is an initiative by the government alongside peter jones of dragons den
4964668 the first academy will open in the south east of england followed by another centre in the north west with a national roll out of satellite academies planned thereafter
4964669 this is exciting successful entrepreneurs are almost by definition highly competitive characters just think what it would mean for our national business culture if our most successful entrepreneurs were to start competing with each other to support the most exciting and dynamic learning institutions

4964714 new information filed late thursday by federal prosecutors says sen ted stevens made more than 100 000 in profit off a florida real estate deal after a friend secretly loaned him 31 000 interest free to buy a condominium
4964715 but in new court filings last night the feds laid out evidence from wiretaps and seized emails to show in detail some favors stevens allegedly did for the company prosecutors made the disclosure in a motion seeking to introduce the information at stevens trial set for september one of those alleged favors concerns a proposed pipeline that veco hoped the state and federal governments would approve in a phone conversation tapped by federal agents in 2006 stevens told bill allen the head of veco that the senator would try to smooth out the politics specifically resistance on the state level involved in the permit approval process

4964719 the mcg surface might need to get better too because its the worst ive ever seen it
4964720 were leading into round 19 or 20 and theres been enormous talk about the telstra dome surface three or four years ago
4964721 telstra dome is miles better than the mcg at the present time and i dont know when theyre going to resurface it prior to finals but i reckon it needs addressing
4964722 youll see a slightly different mcg when we start the september action
4964723 we usually have a look at whats needed coming into the finals and then replace turf in that week leading up so from the last game before the first week of the finals well re turf some sections
4964724 one must first remove the fallen trees then tidy up the house and cellar and in the third phase bring the shine back to the house
4964725 and i hope that we can end this quickly maybe already by year end to bring the shine back to the house that would take based on experience two to three years

4964751 weve certainly had increased demand but theres a big commitment to meeting the needs of these veterans
4964752 congress is doing the right thing by spending money for more treatment
4964753 the va and the army had been doing their best with limited funding and theyll do better with more funding but theres still a tremendous need that needs to be addressed
4964754 were pouring our heart and soul into it because its such an important issue
4964755 the department of veterans affairs at the national level needs new leadership that recognizes warfare for what it is and takes care of these veterans when they come home
4964756 this is a fight its a fight for health care for our veterans for illnesses that are largely ignored denied and left untreated and its wrong
4964757 there was unmet need and we wanted to be there

4964775 i dont want to give anything away but theres a scene that the four of us girls created on our own
4964776 we all went to greece together to film a portion of the film and we were walking by a cliff and we saw all these people jumping off that cliff and were like what are they doing
4964777 i was just mulling about and then the actresses all came up to me and said ok this is what we want to do we want to jump off cliffs because we saw these people do it yesterday
4964778 in my head im going oh my god i dont want to lose any of them
4964779 its really high actually and it was a little bit scary but we thought it would be a nice way to end the movie
4964780 the first experience was so ideal for me and i so love the material and i love these girls
4964781 this basically picks up where the last one left off its the second third and fourth books by ann brashares all crammed into one movie
4964782 were older were in college in this film so the themes are a little more mature theres more dating and its about trying to start your own life when you go off to college theyre each trying to grow individually while trying to stay connected to their past and to each other
4964783 the first film was such a beloved movie i definitely didnt want the second sisterhood of the traveling pants to be disconnected from it
4964784 i just made sure that the sequel felt like it progressed because the actresses have progressed
4964785 the only thing thats different is we can all really relate to what its like to be the lead of a show because weve all done it now
4964786 it really is nice to be able to talk to other girls our same age who have been through that because its a unique experience
4964787 the four of us formed a really tight bond and in the three years between the first and second movie weve all been a part of each others lives
4964788 weve seen each other go through all these changes in our lives amber and i have been traveling together campaigning for hillary clinton and i go to see amber do her poetry and alexis and i do dinners and blakes in new york so shes the only one whos kind of separate from us but shes living her fabulous new york lifestyle while the rest of us are in l a

4964792 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4964793 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4964794 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4964795 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4964796 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4964797 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4964798 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
4964799 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians
4964800 the peacekeepers are there and the troops are going out bit by bit
4964801 the ceasefire is fragile like all ceasefires but it is absolutely necessary for diplomatic and political pressure to continue
4964802 the russian military has effective control over the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
4964803 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly
4964804 the win is extremely important to start off at home
4964805 i think we were a little rusty at times in the first half but certainly the second we got a bit more cohesion so i was really pleased with how we finished off the game
4964806 once we went a goal down we had to look at trying to get in behind them their centre backs are quite slow so we wanted to inject a bit of pace but we just couldnt get the right ball to nikita
4964807 thats credit to adelaide they stopped us playing in midfield changed to 4 5 1 blocked the midfield up and snuffed us out

4964813 even taking into account timo glocks form for isport in the second half of 2006 and his pedigree as a driver whos made four f1 starts already i was underwhelmed by di grassis efforts in 2007
4964814 glock suffered some galling car failures but di grassi rarely seemed poised to capitalise he often brought the car home in the points but managed just a single win all year with the team that had dominated gp2 thus far

4964942 its a problem with this long campaign season the election starts too early
4964943 candidates were responding a year ago to concerns about health care and iraq which last summer was still pretty bad there were soft spots in the economy back then but things were pretty stable fast forward a year now the candidates have to reposition themselves

4964958 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4964959 with republicans we usually think of them as comfortable in an evangelical setting
4964960 its big news that a democrat will be in that setting and obamas much more comfortable in that world
4964961 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
4964962 its a chance for mccain to reinforce that hes with the evangelical community on most issues

4964964 if drug cartels can ship up to 10 tons of cocaine in a semi submersible they can clearly ship or rent space to a terrorist organization for a weapon of mass destruction or a high profile terrorist
4964965 this is a more sophisticated way of getting the dope into the country
4964966 is harder to track than an airplane or a regular boat and it does not rely on an extensive network of corruption the way smuggling through a container port might
4964967 where the technology is going right now they most likely have to have some outside expertise
4964968 during the cold war the russians had hundreds of submarines and their submarine building has collapsed
4964969 there is already senior level contact between russian gangsters and colombian gangsters there are enough mobsters in russia to make the approach for the colombian drug organizations
4964970 they are able to carry their cargo readily at a fairly good speed and they are easily scuttled
4964971 they were the average joe now with semi submersible vessels and supply vessels at way points there is a much more elaborate transportation system than there used to be
4964972 they have created a far more sophisticated and from a security perspective potentially far more daunting maritime threat

4964989 whilst there will be some moderation we dont expect the total world to slip into some sort of downward spiral and the us recession if there is a recession will be shortlived
4964990 here in australia were very fortunate to have the resource boom supporting everything were doing
4964991 this year we became more serious about our program bearing in mind the forward opportunities we have
4964992 the construction programs are just so enormous that you have skills shortages
4964993 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we have the money and if we sell one or two more we can buy another player i have the support of at least one of the owners
4964994 he was clear we could spend its not a question of money so i dont know why its taken so long
4964995 i cant explain it its clear they were supporting me in my opinion we dont do what we should do to sign players but im working as hard as i can for the club

4965006 among the causes of homosexuality is a contagious demonic factor
4965007 even heterosexual promiscuity is a perversion and intercourse which belongs in the sanctuary of married love can become a pathway not only for disease but also for evil spirits
4965008 some very unpleasant things must be mentioned because young people especially are vulnerable and we must do what we can to protect and warn them
4965009 dehumanising effects of contraception and abortion and ivf of homosexual marriages of human cloning and the vivisection of human embryos in scientific research
4965010 only by a genuine personal decision for christ and the church can someone separate himself from it
4965011 the thin end of the wedge soft drugs yoga for relaxation horoscopes just for fun and so on is more dangerous than the thick end because it is more deceptive an evil spirit tries to make his entry as unobtrusively as possible
4965012 beware of any claim to mediate beneficial energies eg reiki any courses that promise the peace that christ promises eg enneagrams any alternative therapy with its roots in eastern religion e g acupuncture
4965013 at the centre of this is mans ever growing pride and attempted self reliance man trying to build a better world without god another tower of babel
4965014 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
4965015 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

4965026 la sesta strada ad austin la versione ridotta di bourbon street
4965027 offre ospitalit a molte folle di giovani che passano la serata di bar in bar
4965028 there were mothers holding their little childrens hands and people running
4965029 it was like chaos just people running around in circles and screaming
4965030 i looked over and girls and little children were just running around away from the scene
4965031 the hardest part was trying to figure out where i was going to go after each couch surfing
4965032 to effectively get rid of privacy union bosses can stand over workers shoulders and use coercion its bad enough that workers will lose their right to privacy but it will tilt the whole political spectrum to the left when it comes to labor politics
4965033 its left up to the employer whether or not an election is held they hold all the power they can intimidate workers to force them from forming a bargaining unit its time to bring back the middle class
4965034 everything from television radio and print ads to a youtube page web advertising and a substantial grassroots organizing effort
4965035 its the most important issue in the election to us
4965036 but that doesnt mean we cant continue to run ads that address the issue
4965037 ive heard that from other folks he was intended to be intimidating but the whole card check things is intimidating the question is how do you educate someone in 30 seconds on an issue you can bring a voter to water but you cant make them go further if they dont want to
4965038 and they told me i would be welcomed to buy an ad
4965039 who tie things up to try to prevent us from coming in
4965040 to bargain with their employers for better wages and benefits
4965041 doesnt have the resources to buy the kind of ad time
4965042 out of state allies spending money in new hampshire trying to distort jeanne shaheens position
4965043 attempts to link tom allen and maines 67 000 union members to organized crime this is wrong and has no place in this campaign
4965044 low wages and unstable or seasonal employment leave many families struggling to make ends meet
4965045 the community and policy makers have a responsibility to address the issue of child poverty
4965046 when a child lives in poverty the child doesnt develop to his or her full potential
4965047 when parents divorce it places an incredible burden on the parent who has custody of the children because that parent now has to survive on one income
4965048 the children often have fewer resources like food clothing and shelter
4965049 some arent able to get the medicines or care they need and many will never have the benefit of a higher education which can help lift them out of poverty
4965050 i used alcohol for pain but it was the same addiction
4965051 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
4965052 the hardest part is not knowing if im going to have a place to stay
4965053 the kids come in in tears they have nowhere to stay
4965054 we had a 70 percent decrease in funding between 2001 and 2003
4965055 most of the resources that were committed to serving this population were eliminated
4965056 its a group of kids that are on the margins of funding
4965057 they drop out of school they age out of foster care they come out of juvenile justice if were not intentional about meeting their needs this population is going to continue to grow
4965058 all the kids know him a kid needs a beer they find john
4965059 if someone wants your camp spot they can kill you if you dont move
4965060 if you dont know what youre doing and where to get food youre kind of screwed
4965061 the runaway kids on the street are pretty well victimized by the older homeless community
4965062 we all know it goes on but it doesnt get reported as a criminal offense
4965063 its a pretty closed community unless something major happens theyre not likely to talk about it
4965064 many of these kids think its pretty glamorous to live on the street and have no rules
4965065 the fortunate thing is the majority of kids dont tend to stay in this lifestyle for a long time
4965066 they run the gamut from kids who dont come home by their curfew to kids who meet a boyfriend on the internet and flee the state
4965067 it can be dangerous at night you never know whos coming around or if they have weapons the streets is no place for anybody
4965068 we have some basic services but nothing that is comprehensive
4965069 a lot of families that had been doing fine all of a sudden cant make ends meet anymore
4965070 theres a lot of denial that it cant be happening
4965071 were dealing with families that have good prospects for becoming self sufficient probably more so than in the past
4965072 anytime someone is feeling alienated from hope or from their future that has caused them to be in that situation that has an impact on all of us as a community
4965073 if you have a group that then finds solace in loitering or things like that that can be a hindrance to commerce
4965074 they have been ignored but i dont think thats right theyre young adults in just a few years we want them to be contributing to our community if theyre dropping out of school and living in a park thats not helping them become contributing adults
4965075 its elemental imagery very closely akin to cave painting or etching this very old 10 000 year old art where they just took the spiritually essential imagery around them
4965076 people like that kind of intimacy and being able to see the whole thing
4965077 this show is actually sponsored and put on by artists themselves so they have this wonderful artist friendly environment
4965078 i was really pleased to see people flowing into the park early on
4965079 people are coming early because of the hot weather but those that are wandering around are happy and theyre enjoying the show so thats what we want
4965080 if youre going to be outside this is the best place to be
4965081 i was never sure that my stuff qualified or that it was good enough
4965082 it was kind of found junk art or folk art but they said this is what we love you must get involved so i did and this is my third year
4965083 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4965084 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4965085 oh its going to be so hard to say goodbye i love you all too
4965086 toto were home home and this is my room and youre all here and im never leaving here ever ever again because i love you all
4965087 just governments must sometimes take the lives of unrepentant terrorist mass murderers in order to protect and uphold the infinite value of human life
4965088 well they may observe that but i dont have to
4965089 am i praying out of love for all my fellow jews or just those i happen to know about and agree with

4965095 whoever heard of moshiach with a brim thats turned down
4965096 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
4965097 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
4965098 no difference to me what i wear on my head
4965099 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
4965100 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
4965101 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
4965102 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
4965103 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts

4965113 determinism does not exist except maybe in the female human mind
4965114 loose associations and creativity is a function of associations between unrelated concepts
4965115 if humans have even the tiniest amount of free will then atoms themselves must also behave unpredictably

4965144 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4965145 this exhibition examines the departure from the idealism of childhood once we assent from the comfort of our adolescence we are exposed to the reality of the world our vision of childhood innocence becomes skewed the serious issues and responsibilities that consume our lives blur the memories
4965146 whilst there will be some moderation we dont expect the total world to slip into some sort of downward spiral and the us recession if there is a recession will be shortlived

4965153 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
4965154 i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4965155 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4965156 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4965157 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4965158 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honor to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it

4965247 adapun murjiah mereka mengatakan iman hanyalah ucapan tanpa amal per buatan barangsiapa yang bersyahadat laa ilaha illa allohu wa anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu maka dia telah sempuma keimanannya
4965248 ahlu sunnah mengatakan bahwa iman itu adalah ucapan dan perbuatan
4965249 pernah imam ahmad ditanya tentang murjiah lalu beliau berkata murjiah adalah kelompok yang menyatakan iman itu hanyalah ucapan
4965250 berhati hatilah kalian rohimakumullahu dari ucapan orang yang mengatakan sesungguhnya imanku seperti imannya jibril dan mikail
4965251 aku pernah bertanya kepada yahya bin salim ath thoo i ketika kami berada di belakang maqom ibrahim di masjidil haram mekah pent
4965252 telah sampai kepadaku bahwa syubah berkata kepada syariik rahimahullahu mengapa engkau tidak memperbolehkan persaksian murjiah
4965253 berhati hatilah kalian rahimakumullahu dari bermajlis dengan suatu kaum yang keluar dari agama ini karena mereka mengingkari dan menyelisihi rasul shallallahu alaihi wa salam serta keluar dari ijma ulama kaum muslimin
4965254 berhati hatilah katian rahimahumullahu dari orang yang mengatakan saya mukmin di sisi alloh dan saya mukmin yang sempurna imannya dan berhati hatilah dari orang yang mengatakan imanku seperti imannya jibril dan mikail
4965255 mereka dinamakan murjiah karena mereka mengakhirkan amal per huatan dari keimanan
4965256 murjiah yang mengatakan iman adalah pembenaran dalam hati serta ucapan dengan lisan dan bahwasanya amal bukan termasuk iman diantara mereka adalah fuqoha kufah dan para ahli ibadah
4965257 adapun masalah istitsna mengatakan insya alloh ed dalam iman yaitu seseorang mengatakan saya mukmin insya alloh maka manusia ada tiga pendapat dalam hal ini ada yang mewajibkan ada pula yang mengharam an dan ada juga yang membolehkan kedua duanya
4965258 murjiah adalah suatu kelompok sempalan dalam islam yang meyakini bahwa makiat tidaklah memadhorotkan keimanan seba gaimana tidak bermanfaat ketaatan bersama kekufuran
4965259 saya mengatakan iman adalah ucapan dan perbuatan bagaimana mungkin saya menjadi murjiah
4965260 barangsiapa yang mengatakan iman itu ucapan dan perbuatan bertambah dan berkurang maka dia telah keluar dari murjiah mulai dari awal sampai akhlrnya
4965261 sesungguhnya sekelompok ahli bidah yang bernama al manshuriyah menuduh ahlu sunnah sebagai murjiah karena mereka ahlu sunnah mengatakan bahwa orang yang meninggalkan sholat jika tidak diiringi dengan pengingkaran akan kewajibannya maka dia masih muslim menurut pendapat yang kuat dari madzhab imam ahmad
4965262 ucapan tentang tidak kafirnya orang yang meninggalkan sholat karena malas telah dikatakan oleh sekelompok dari para imam yang mengatakan iman adalah ucapan dan perbuatan
4965263 sesungguhnya dia kurang imannya dan berada di bawah kehendak alloh jika dia berkehendak dia akan mengadzabnya di neraka meski tidak kekal didalamnya pent dan jika dia mau dia ampuni serta dia masukkan kedalam surga nya
4965264 ahli hadits berselisih pendapat tentang seorang muslim yang meninggalkan sholat fardhu dengan sengaja
4965265 antara seorang hamba dengan kesyirikan adalah meninggalkan sholat maka barangsiapa yang mening galkan sholat ia kafir
4965266 barangsiapa yang meninggalkan sholat dengan mengingkari kewajibannya maka dia kafir
4965267 inikah yang melatar belakangi kalian untuk menuduh dakwah salafiyah sebagai murjiah tidakkah kalian membuka mata iebar lebar untuk membaca ucapan para ulama salaf tentang ketidakkafiran orang yang berhukum dengan selain hukum alloh jika tidak diiringi oleh istihlal
4965268 barangsiapa yang tidak berhukum menurut apa yang diturunkan alloh maka mereka itu adalah orang orang yang kafir
4965269 adapun pemutus dan saksi atas semua ini adalah firman alloh
4965270 yang benar bahwa berhukum dengan selain hukum alloh mencakup dua bentuk kekufuran kufur kecil dan besar sesuai dengan keadaan orang tersebut
4965271 apakah mereka mempunyai sembahan sembahan selain alloh yang mensyariat kan untuk mereka agama yang tidak diizinkan alloh
4965272 pewajiban dan penghara man dosa dan pahala serta takfir pengkafiran dan tafsiq penfasikan adalah hak alloh dan rasul nya saja
4965273 diantara syubhat khowarij adalah berpegangnya mereka dengan pent firman alloh
4965274 namun orang orang kafir itu mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan tuhan mereka
4965275 khowarij berdalil dengan ayat ini untuk menyatakan bahwa orang yang berbuat maksiat kepada alloh itu kafir mereka mengatakan ayat ini adalah nash pada setiap orang yang tidak berhukum dengan hukum alloh bahwa dia itu kafir
4965276 madzhab nya khowarij adalah barangsiapa yang mengambil uang suap dan berhukum dengan selain hukum alloh maka dia kafir
4965277 kelompok khowarij adalah kelompok pertama yang mengkafirkan kaum muslimin dan mengatakan kafir bagi setiap pelaku dosa
4965278 apabila engkau melihat seseorang melaknat pemimpin kaum muslimin maka ketahuilah bahwa dia itu pengekor hawa nafsu ahlu bidah
4965279 dan tidaklah yang mengatakan bahwa orang yang meninggalkan sholat karena malas pent tidak kafir melainkan yang telah kemasukan pemikiran murjiah baik dia merasa atau tidak
4965280 aqidah jamaah salafiyah dalam masalan iman adalah aqidah murjiah fuqoha dan dalam masalah pengkafiran adalah aqidah murjiah ekstrim jahmiyah
4965281 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4965283 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4965284 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4965285 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4965286 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4965287 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4965313 the letters i could tell were the familiar twenty six i had grown up with only now when i brought them into focus they looked like cyrillic one moment and korean the next
4965314 the sine agraphia was the sop designed to make me feel good it was like being told that the right leg had to be amputated but that i could keep the shoe and sock
4965315 from here on though i could and often would ask advice of my colleagues there would be nobody above me i was on my own with that first patient that fact in itself was terrifying

4965317 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4965318 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4965319 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4965320 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4965321 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4965322 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4965323 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4965324 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4965325 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4965326 every single radio station that we gave handlebars to their initial reaction was oh hell no
4965327 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4965328 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4965329 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4965330 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4965331 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4965332 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

4965338 were bringing some new and old friends of the seacoast community to durham bring your dancing shoes
4965339 these guys are fantastic nobody does gospel and blues like the holmes brothers theyre the real thing
4965340 i love to just randomly and anonymously buy peoples food at restaurants the mom with the bratty kids that are screaming and ruining your meal instead of getting mad and wondering why she brings them in public why not buy her meal itll put a new perspective on things so when youre debt fee keep 10 20 a week set aside just for buying peoples meals
4965341 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4965342 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4965343 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4965344 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4965345 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4965346 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4965347 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4965348 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4965349 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4965350 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4965351 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4965352 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4965353 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4965375 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4965376 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4965377 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4965378 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4965379 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4965380 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4965381 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4965382 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4965383 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4965384 every single radio station that we gave handlebars to their initial reaction was oh hell no
4965385 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4965386 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4965387 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4965388 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4965389 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4965390 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

4965406 there is no prototype there are no standards there is no scientific research that would guarantee any election district that theres a machine that can be used to answer these very serious questions and so my sense is that the politicians in washington have concluded that the system cant be all that bad because after all it produced them and as long as an elected official is an elected official then whatever machine was used whatever device was used to elect him or her seems to be adequate but theres an erosion of voting rights implicit in our inability to trust the technology that we use and if we were another country being analyzed by america we would conclude that this country is ripe for stealing elections and for fraud

4965420 clearly its not going to hold up under the stress of me going out there every five days and throwing a lot of pitches
4965421 by no means do i want to go through another year with what im going through now
4965422 but at the same time i dont think i want my career to end this way either i think that lends me to think i want to pitch next year i think its easier to walk away if you can honestly tell yourself you know what i cant do it anymore and i dont know that i can answer that question right now because my body hasnt allowed me to do it this year as much i wanted to
4965423 when i was healthy i pitched well when i wasnt i didnt that makes it harder to say i cant do it anymore

4965467 perch i nostri generali non si fidano del presidente georgiano saakahvili quindi stiamo andando a difendere i nostri amici ossetini
4965468 alle 23 45 del 7 agosto scorso le forze georgiane hanno attaccato la capitale dellossezia del sud con lanciarazzi a testata multipla e bombardato la citt fino alle 9 del mattino seguente la mia chiesa andata distrutta sotto le macerie sono morte decine di fedeli che credevano di avervi trovato rifugio
4965469 non ho voluto benedire le salme dei soldati georgiani uccisi in ossezia perch sono cristiani che hanno trucidato altri cristiani
4965470 saakashvili ha giustificato il bombardamento sui civili sostenendo che voleva ristabilire lordine costituzionale ma l il novanta per cento degli abitanti da anni chiede di potersi distaccare da tbilisi
4965471 quando sono cadute le prime bombe mi sono nascosta nel rifugio del mio condominio e l sono rimasta per due giorni poi i georgiani hanno cominciato a spararci contro e sono dovuta fuggire anchio sotto i colpi di mortaio sono morti mio padre e mio marito
4965472 i georgiani hanno prima bombardato dal cielo poi alle prime luci dellalba hanno fatto intervenire i carri armati hanno allora circondato la citt e cominciato a sparare da ogni parte senza risparmiare nulla quando sono scappata ho visto cadaveri ovunque
4965473 l8 mattina una maestra elementare era riuscita a convincere lautista del pullman della scuola a fare il solito giro per recuperare gli alunni e farli fuggire verso lossezia del nord una volta raccolto lultimo piccolo il pulmino stato centrato da un razzo deliberatamente sono morti tutti

4965479 there were just a few too many tulips around the place and who comes to training by canal
4965480 ill have a look at myself and evaluate whether i picked the right team
4965481 we were looking fine in the first 25 minutes but we dropped our heads after the first goal the other two goals were disappointing they came from set pieces were were naive in both situations
4965482 i think the scoreline is a bit harsh as one or two things did not go our way
4965483 we improved when they came on and i think we will be better when we gain experience in the premier league

4965485 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4965486 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4965487 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4965488 one is often cured of his faults by seeing them in others life is a mirror and we find only ourselves reflected in our associations living in the past is a failure method and a violation of spiritual law
4965489 never put conditions before your life accept life as it unfolds and life knows best when and what to offer
4965490 you must fight to get what you want when life hold all the treasure before you

4965506 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we have the money and if we sell one or two more we can buy another player i have the support of at least one of the owners
4965507 he was clear we could spend its not a question of money so i dont know why its taken so long
4965508 i cant explain it its clear they were supporting me in my opinion we dont do what we should do to sign players but im working as hard as i can for the club
4965509 i am not thinking of leaving just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best

4965589 i am very proud of what we have achieved and this success simply would not have been possible without a team of talented experienced and dedicated management personnel and employees and the steady support and guidance we received from the board however i believe this is the right moment for me to transition to a less active role with the company in order to spend more time with my family and on other personal interests which i have not been able to do in light of my daily responsibilities at the company

4965599 theyre not going to be talking about running for office
4965600 hes going to stick to the purpose of the event which is to bring more enthusiasm to richmond students
4965601 its just a way to get some school supplies to the kids
4965602 ive done this every year for a number of years election or no election
4965603 its standard richmond politics and its why we have the system we have
4965604 its about integrity and fairness because you have the right to do it doesnt mean its in the best interest of voters
4965605 its not a march to a new modernized school because they havent done it yet
4965606 they couldnt figure out how to modernize one school in four years
4965607 im tired of these feel good things that hide the fact that elected officials havent done what they said theyd do
4965608 i just want to be extremely clear that the focus has always been on the children
4965609 the benefit is we can drive down the street much quicker than we can get out walk and take off the lid of each meter
4965610 our meter readers each read approximately 300 meters per day with our current system

4965632 prima della mia ricerca si pensava che le donne avessero difficolt a raggiungere lorgasmo e che comunque dovessero sforzarsi di trovare la realizzazione vaginale durante il rapporto allora si chiamava semplicemente orgasmo vaginale
4965633 certo la vagina un organo che d piacere alle donne vista anche la posizione in cui si trova la mia ricerca non nega questo ma dimostra piuttosto che la stimolazione vaginale non porta allorgasmo la maggior parte delle donne molte donne considerano il rapporto penetrativo come una specie di petting ma poi usano uno specifico tipo di massaggio clitorideo per raggiungere lorgasmo
4965634 il sesso pu essere trasformato fino a diventare un vocabolario individuale di gesti erotici combinazione di corpi destinati a raggiungere alti stati di eccitazione e desiderio oltre la ricerca dellorgasmo da parte di uomini o donne il sesso pu diventare qualcosa di nuovo qualcosa che non abbiamo ancora visto qualcosa che che tutti noi possiamo creare impegnandoci a fare passi coraggiosi sulla via del cambiamento culturale
4965635 we spent more than two years working with jeremy wariner the best curve runner in the world to design the adidas lone star

4965644 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4965645 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4965646 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4965647 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
4965648 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
4965649 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
4965650 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
4965651 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
4965652 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better

4965657 until now a lot of brose components were inside the door or the seat structure not in direct contact with the consumer
4965658 but with broses first show vehicle were getting closer and closer to the consumer
4965659 but the customer could sell it as an option for 400 to 500
4965660 it isnt that our engineers developed something that will just get another engineer excited these products deliver either real comfort or safety to the end user
4965661 but the customer could sell it as an option for 400 to 500
4965662 these products deliver either real comfort or safety the benefits to the end user
4965663 dont explain why it cant be done discover how it can be done
4965664 innovation means committing to revolutionary ideas you have to be willing to accept failure
4965665 defending yesterday that is not innovating is far more risky than making tomorrow an established company which in an age demanding innovation is not able to innovate is doomed to extinction
4965666 the beginning is the most important part of the work
4965667 man is most nearly himself when he achieves the seriousness of a child at play
4965668 it is not necessary to change survival is not mandatory
4965669 because its purpose is to create a customer the business enterprise has two and only these two basic functions marketing and innovation marketing and innovation produce results all the rest are just costs
4965670 all growth is a leap in the dark a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience
4965671 he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils for time is the greatest innovator
4965672 if you have enough information to make a business case youre too late
4965673 innovation is a team sport but it depends on individual competencies
4965674 only a fool would make predictions especially about the future
4965675 the most effective way to cope with change is to create it
4965676 never be afraid to try something new or challenge conventional wisdom remember amateurs built the ark professionals built the titanic
4965677 the only sustainable competitive advantage comes from out innovating the competition
4965678 an idea is not a reality until it becomes an action
4965679 the goal is not to speculate on what might happen but to imagine what you can actually make happen
4965680 when the rate of change outside is greater than the rate of change inside the end is in sight
4965681 the biggest limitation we face is how fast we can innovate were constrained by how fast ur brains can work
4965682 the problem is never how to get new innovative thoughts into your mind but how to get old ones out
4965683 people who seem to have a new idea have often simply stopped having an old idea
4965684 marketing is what people do who dont have an idea
4965685 if youre a traditional employer beware youre a way station for talent just until the economy clears up
4965686 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has
4965687 i like nonsense it wakes up the brain cells fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living
4965688 competition is not healthy i dont like it its not good for me or my business i think ill just do something new and different and confuse those guys
4965689 our favorite quotes are those that resonate with us somehow and catalyze us to think new thoughts and take new actions
4965690 the sooner you fall behind the more time youll have to catch up
4965691 wealth in the new regime flows directly from innovation not optimization that is wealth is not gained by perfecting the known but by imperfectly seizing the unknown
4965692 i cant explain it its not the reaction id imagined to winning gold but its magical
4965693 its been so hard i cant explain what i had to go through i totally believe in myself now i did before but that was the ultimate facing demons and up against top opposition today
4965694 one must first remove the fallen trees then tidy up the house and cellar and in the third phase bring the shine back to the house
4965695 to finally get there get some great breeze and to win the race after two or three years of hard work means its all been worth it im a happy man
4965696 its pretty good going to have four medals but the draw of 2012 on home waters is huge
4965697 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
4965698 to avoid offenders absconding on a stop over it is essential to have law enforcement or diplomatic chaperones from either country escort the individual back to the uk
4965699 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4965700 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4965701 im really happy because there werent many times last season we came from behind to win
4965702 could i have asked for more i would have liked a clean sheet as those are going to be very important this season
4965703 he geovanni gives us something that we perhaps didnt have last season a little bit of quality in the middle
4965704 what if we used this familiar proven old tool differently

4965718 we have received drugs from the government and the royal palace but we will need more if troops move back in basics like paracetamol based mixagrip for fevers and vitamin c
4965719 if thailand does not permanently withdraw its troops after these meetings we are looking at some serious potential epidemics on the border as well as some very big sanitation issues
4965720 we have plenty of food but it is all dried or tinned and there are no fresh vegetables
4965721 if the talks fail and we have to dig in again there are going to be casualties on both sides from poor nutrition and of course malaria some have fallen ill already

4965751 they have to be seen as thoughtful responsible stewards of economic policy who can get along with business and talk to business
4965752 john talks to and cares about big business but he has the greatest affinity for small business which creates more than 70 percent of the jobs in this country
4965753 his entire lens on economic policy is job creation and small business
4965754 ive gotten calls for a year and half saying tell me about this guy
4965755 says william m daley who served as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration before returning to chicago where he is a senior executive with jpmorgan chase
4965756 ive long admired john mccain and i told him i would be delighted to help him
4965757 and i said i have good news for you john
4965758 mccains style makes the big business crowd uncomfortable but they will back him in the election because of his conservative free market policies
4965759 the small business crowd likes him for reasons of both policy and persona
4965760 i have never run a small struggling business unless you count my presidential campaign last year
4965761 not to denigrate government but to make it better not to deride it but to restore its good name
4965762 when he tells you something i think he really means it
4965763 barack tended to attract the younger up and coming leaders at big firms and people in private equity
4965764 many of them had an interest in economic policy as well we didnt have as many gray hairs at the table so there was room for them
4965765 he was remarkably clear eyed and thoughtful about what the country needed to do
4965766 most businesspeople at the big business level are republicans either knee jerk or born into it
4965767 and no one has wrapped himself around the new technology and the new fund raising space like obama so to that crowd this is a message
4965768 he listened more than he talked which is always a good thing
4965769 he clearly sees himself as a clever synthesizer of other peoples ideas and i think that is an important skill in a president
4965770 i dont think senator obama has an agenda for big business
4965771 hes trying to affect the overall economy and hes got to find a way to help people who are worse off i dont think he loses any sleep worrying about how to craft a policy just for big business nor should he and i say that as a former commerce secretary
4965772 but on the big issues that will determine whether the u s is prosperous and whether we improve the living standards of working people i think hes right
4965773 edge vs the undertaker hell in a cell till death do us part
4965774 the cabinet is a large pool of available business for many industries in kentucky
4965775 not only for road contractors but for the asphalt industry the concrete industry signage businesses seeding business for the side of roads insecticide spraying and many others
4965776 thats the situation we found ourselves in when we walked in the door on dec 12
4965777 in many cases this is inflated in the minds of the media
4965778 we had a project recently in johnson county for 1 25 million
4965779 there were four bids and it came in under estimate thats what we want to see
4965780 too often over the years it seems changes are made in road contracts
4965781 and i dont recall seeing change orders that decrease the bid
4965782 didnt become the giant that it is until the mid 1950s with the advent of the interstate highway system
4965783 to do the job right you are going to have to keep a close eye on the money and likely upset some people
4965784 but if you dont do it right you can have the fbi on your tail
4965785 i will be absolutely livid if i find out that someone in the cabinet is making decisions for the wrong reason or because of undue influence
4965786 my mission is to return the cabinet to the condition where kentuckians can have pride in it
4965787 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4965788 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4965789 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4965790 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4965791 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4965792 women start adult life happier than men but end up less happy
4965793 women are more likely than men to be in unions and this makes for greater fulfillment of both family life and material
4965794 it doesnt get any better than this i quit also time stood still in the birds nest last night the clock at first registered 9 68sec just as usain bolt was hurtling across the finishing line and heading with jet propelled shoes towards the stands on the far side of the track
4965795 to finally get there get some great breeze and to win the race after two or three years of hard work means its all been worth it im a happy man
4965796 its pretty good going to have four medals but the draw of 2012 on home waters is huge
4965797 its a long way away well see if i got the chance to be there and to do well id love to do it
4965798 you know its hard the pressure you feel when the conditions are like that and i was very happy today when the wind was blowing and i could sail my own race a little bit more
4965799 i would have taken it the result yesterday anyway but im much happier to have gone out and beaten people like that and won the race thats for sure
4965800 its nice to have a really good breeze and to go out and use your fitness and your speed and sail a good race its a much more satisfying way to win
4965801 its fantastic and im so pleased for the girls i watched their race and they sailed a really impressive race against the dutch that wasnt easy having a boat one point behind you
4965802 that was an inspiration watching them and hopefully thats a good start for the sailing team
4965803 cuando veo el comportamiento de la gente a lo largo del verano es verdad que no existe la alegr a de otros a os pero tampoco hay una sensaci n de paralizaci n del pa s
4965804 todos hemos estado subidos al carro de trece a os de crecimiento

4965806 cuando sube el precio del petr leo somos m s pobres
4965807 our rate of increase in spending for prisons is almost double that of education
4965808 we are spending more and more on our problems at the expense of our solutions
4965809 kentucky does not have enough money to do everything it wants to do
4965810 so it certainly cannot afford to lose one dollar to waste fraud and inefficiencies
4965811 heres a business we basically created with our tax dollars and now theyre using some of those dollars to entertain our officials
4965812 some parts of the state have resigned themselves to corrupt government which means citizens dont get the kind of services they deserve and honest people often dont try to run for office because its too discouraging
4965813 i hope that some of our audits and the prosecutions that come out of them show that it doesnt have to be this way
4965814 nazi storm troopers assaulting a jewish community in world war ii
4965815 if the people responsible for the problems youre looking at are still there and in charge of everything it can get pretty hostile
4965816 you always hope when new people get in that it will change things but it hasnt happened yet
4965817 it can be frustrating to read in the newspaper about continuing problems at oakwood
4965818 and know that we were warning about this very thing years ago
4965819 we often take three steps forward and four steps back rather than stick with reforms for any sustained effort
4965820 in the patton administration we put a lot of money and effort into higher ed reform into improving the system and trying to make it more accessible and nearly every year since then the higher ed budget has been cut
4965821 she was my best sounding board for health insurance issues
4965822 i would get all tied up in the minutiae and the numbers related to our health costs
4965823 ok lets look at the big picture here and she got it
4965824 nothing but spew these threats and insults to frighten people
4965825 if you take a map of the state and identify where we have the lowest levels of education and not surprisingly the highest levels of poverty and then the worst problems we find with corruption they will basically match up
4965826 until we are doing more to educate our people were not going to turn around any of these other problems
4965827 serei um presidente pr vida e meu mandato ter pol ticas pr vida esse meu compromisso com voc s

4965841 dad why do they all look different to on tv
4965842 the mainstream media such as state owned rtm will immediately apportion the blame to us i say let us investigate and punish those perpetrators irrespective they are from pakatan rakyat or barisan nasional
4965843 my point is that the mainstream media is at fault for presenting a biased case not only that but malicious attack against pkr
4965844 berita harian said this samseng culture is now prevalent in pkr but when umno youth deputy chief khairy jamaluddin and gang threw bottles they were not at fault
4965845 this is the berita harian culture which must be corrected because it is slanderous and treacherous to defend corruption and cruelty
4965846 i eat drink sleep and even dream birds birds are my vocation as well as my avocation
4965847 the lord mortifies through contrition so that later he may vivify through the consoling spirit god does not bind your wounds unless you first recognize and deplore them god does not cover unless you first uncover god does ignore unless you first acknowledge he does not justify unless you first condemn yourself god works this true repentance through his spirit
4965848 you can make these up to one week in advance
4965849 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4965850 i like to have responsibility on and off the pitch on the pitch i try to talk a lot to compare myself to all of my team mates here is very exciting
4965851 this poster comes as a surprise this would be the 1945 season in which art concello owned the show mr buck and mr concello had trouped together on the ringling show in 1938 but i was not aware of this arrangement
4965852 i was really nervous i wanted to take it out strong and come home as strong as i could
4965853 certainly it would have been something if we didnt do it
4965854 but its not like we were getting pressure to swim for mike we wanted to do this not just for mike but for ourselves
4965855 for such an individual sport we really know how to get together for those relays
4965856 some of the greatest memories from meets like this are the times spent with teammates
4965857 there were a lot of rookies on the mens team some of them i didnt really know as well as others playing spades playing risk relaxing and getting to know everyone on the team being part of team usa and the olympic team is one of the greatest memories i will take from this
4965858 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

4965864 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4965865 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4965866 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4965867 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

4965890 its been a while i cant remember its probably the worst ive seen
4965891 thats a possibility thats for sure but the next two weeks are very important
4965892 next weeks important in the context of where we are so if we can get those six points then fourth could be a possibility for us but again thats three weeks away tries

4965896 i sat there after the last time we played hawthorn raving about what alastair had done with the ability to have that rolling zone going
4965897 obviously we put a fair bit of time into playing them this time around and probably plotted and charted it for four or five weeks in the lead up to this game because its such a different game that they play
4965898 we went from being as undisciplined against adelaide last week structurally to as disciplined structurally against hawthorn as what ive seen us since ive been here
4965899 it shows what you can do in a week of footy
4965900 it was more a four quarter performance than what weve seen
4965901 i think weve won games this year where weve kicked eight or nine goals in a quarter and played a terrific patch and then gone missing for blocks of the game
4965902 i thought it was probably our best four quarter disciplined do the right thing nothing fancy just get the job done game that weve played
4965903 when you run like a chook without a head and run into traffic and dont know where youre going then you panic and you turn the ball over
4965904 i honestly dont think weve got a foot skill problem i think at times weve got a decision making patience panic problem
4965905 we were playing catch up footy and to their absolute credit we couldnt catch them by the end of the four quarters

4966181 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4966182 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4966183 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4966184 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4966185 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4966186 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4966187 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4966188 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4966189 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4966190 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4966191 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4966192 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4966193 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4966194 by endorsing normet filing as a patient safety organization pso the ceos who run these hospitals have again demonstrated their commitment to delivering the safest highest quality of care
4966195 their commitment to delivering excellent care with compassion to the people of the region is reiterated with their visionary support of this new initiative
4966196 the pso is one more example of how our hospitals are dedicated to providing the highest quality of care in the most efficient and safe ways possible not only do they understand that healthcare is local and a very human business but they also understand the business and economic impact of quality care and are dedicated to delivering it
4966197 normet is a leader in the healthcare field and hopefully the secretary will list them in a timely fashion
4966198 bio mini revo and the associated extended length drill guides provides the surgeon with a safe and effective method to repair the labrum
4966199 the bio mini revo technique and extended length instrumentation greatly aid in hip access and minimize the risks of failed anchor fixation
4966200 as hip arthroscopy continues to develop as a surgical specialty and labral repairs in particular become more prevalent we anticipate that the bio mini revo suture anchor will become an important part of our continuously expanding hip product line
4966201 we are excited that this safe and effective implant which has already been used successfully in thousands of surgeries in the shoulder will now be available to our customers for use in the hip

4966206 we are pleased ufe has obtained this important recognition and believe it is a significant step in the ongoing development of the market for this minimally invasive uterus sparing alternative to hysterectomy
4966207 gynecologists are one of the key providers in womens health we believe the new guidelines in this practice bulletin should result in more gynecologists discussing ufe as a mainstream treatment option with their patients and forging collaborative relationships with interventional radiologists to optimize the quality of care offered to women with fibroids

4966210 our fears regarding these medi cal provider cuts are coming true
4966211 pharmacists have been forced to make the incredibly difficult decisions to turn away patients this has been a real struggle for pharmacists as they have served many of these patients for years and have become like family however some pharmacists have no choice as long as the state reimburses them at 10 20 or 50 or more below actual cost of the drug its not rocket science you cant stay in business if you are losing money on nearly every transaction its a sad situation one that can hopefully be remedied by the courts or through an alternative solution by the legislature
4966212 pharmacists have been encouraged by the support we have received from patients across the state
4966213 if you listed all the petition signatures end to end it would stretch ten miles
4966214 the real tragedy is that many of these patients cannot go for even one day without their medication
4966215 especially those with hiv mental illness or cancer any disruption in care can have long term adverse complications and will result in patients turning to emergency rooms for care or worse which will cost the state far more money than the projected savings from these medi cal cuts
4966216 menu board labeling has the potential to dramatically alter the trajectory of the obesity epidemic in california
4966217 if you can skim 50 calories off your diet each time you eat out you are going to reduce your weight gain and might even lose weight this analysis suggests that a painless way to make that happen is to put calorie information on menu boards for everyone to see it will be of great benefit to the 82 percent of california adults who regularly eat at fast food chains
4966218 even nutrition professionals underestimate the calories contained in meals typically available at fast food restaurants by 200 to 600 calories
4966219 we look forward to the results from this trial and believe it will provide a valuable prognostic tool for the treatment of heart attacks that impact so many lives
4966220 the dotlab systems unique ability to measure protein complexes directly in serum in a single test not only has the potential to significantly impact heart attack treatment protocols but could also be applied to many other diseases the trial reinforces axelas objective of commercializing novel diagnostic targets in the area of personalized medicine

4966223 in tante splendide localit ha dichiarato valerio lombardi amministratore delegato italgest mare la rete marpark si sta diffondendo quale modello di turismo nautico di qualit tra le oasi marpark la costa smeralda lesempio pi virtuoso che in difesa dellambiente non ha ceduto a facili speculazioni decidendo di investire su marpark tecnologia sea friendly per ridurre lenorme pressione della nautica da diporto a cui sottoposta sforzi ripagati dalla copiosa utenza che si registra nei campi marpark di porto cervo e cala di volpe e dalla recente delibera 27 7 della regione sardegna che vieta linstallazione di campi boe dannosi per lambiente sensibilizzare i diportisti sulle tematiche ambientali e normative precise e condivise sono dunque la chiave di volta del turismo nautico sostenibile

4966227 the full reality of care on the ground is clearly misunderstood by the government older people and their families
4966228 serious questions about the future of social care are currently being debated and the role of families and carers needs to be a priority within that families are the backbone of care and their support shouldnt be abused or taken advantage of the government must support carers both financially and practically
4966229 these depressing results show that when it comes to healthcare all too often older people and the conditions that affect them come far down the pecking order yet again ageism rears its ugly head
4966230 this report shows that in approximately 7 000 cases older people have been denied the care they desperately need while routinely conditions that are common with older people are less likely to be cared for this is extremely short sighted in an increasingly ageing society
4966231 this kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed the government has announced this will form part of the forthcoming equality bill but no timeframe or process has been agreed until that happens older people will continue to be short changed by the health service the government must commit now to an urgent timetable to ensure this injustice does not continue
4966232 postpartum mothers experience a troubling burden of physical and emotional health challenges after giving birth although many of these problems abate over time far too many women were still experiencing them from 6 to 18 months after birth with more than 4 3 million births each year in the united states it is an urgent priority to better understand the reason for these challenges their implications for women and their families ways to prevent distress and morbidity and ways to help women and families before they experience detrimental effects
4966233 co sleeping was one of the many areas including breastfeeding pregnancy intention and circumcision rates in which we found postpartum experiences of mothers varying widely by race ethnicity these variations merit further research
4966234 this important new study underscores the urgent need to improve maternity and pregnancy related benefits for women in the united states
4966235 while nearly every other economically competitive nation provides paid maternity leave and stronger supports for working mothers women here struggle to cobble together the time off income and childcare they need this survey shows the toll that is taking on mothers and families we can and must do better
4966236 the overall picture is of recent mothers engaged in a juggling act carrying multiple and sometimes conflicting responsibilities while experiencing high levels of social physical and emotional health challenges there are concerns about whether large segments of this population have access to adequate health and social services and social support we are letting our mothers and babies down at one of the most critical and vulnerable times in their lives these survey results are a clarion call to action for programs policies clinical services and research to better understand and improve the experiences of new mothers and their families
4966237 telah nampak kerusakan di darat dan di laut disebabkan karena perbuatan tangan manusia supaya allah menimpakan

4966239 maka tatkala mereka melihat azab itu berupa awan yang menuju ke lembah lembah mereka
4966240 maka masing masing mereka itu kami siksa disebabkan dosanya maka di antara mereka ada yang kami timpakan kepadanya hujan batu kerikil dan di antara mereka ada yang ditimpa suara keras yang mengguntur dan di antara mereka ada yang kami benamkan ke dalam bumi dan di antara mereka ada yang kami tenggelamkan dan allah sekali kali tidak hendak menganiaya mereka akan tetapi merekalah yang menganiaya diri mereka sendiri
4966241 dan allah telah membuat suatu perumpamaan dengan sebuah negeri yang dahulunya aman lagi tenteram rezkinya datang kepadanya melimpah ruah dari segenap tempat

4966247 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
4966248 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
4966249 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said brambell
4966250 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4966251 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
4966252 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4966253 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4966254 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
4966255 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
4966256 its been suggested and we are now talking about that in some way i dont know what it will be but we are having a bit of a think about it
4966257 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic

4966260 ini adalah aqidah hanafiyah maturidiyah yang berseberangan dengan salaf serta jumhur ulama seperti malik syafii ahmad dan selainnya
4966261 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman itu adalah mereka yang apabila disebut nama alloh gemetarlah hati mereka dan apabila dibacakan kepada mereka ayat ayat nya bertambahlah iman mereka karenanya dan kepada tuhanlah mereka bertawakkal yaitu orang orang yang mendirikan shalat dan yang menafkahkan sebagian dari rezki yang kami berikan kepada mereka itulah orang orang yang beriman dengan sebenar benarnya mereka akan memperoleh beberapa derajat ketinggian di sisi tuhannya dan ampunan serta rezki nimat yang mulia
4966262 iman tidak bisa bertambah dan tidak bisa berkurang karena iman menurut kami bukan bagian dari amal
4966263 inilah yang selalu aku katakan sejak lebih dari 20 tahun yang lalu untuk menguatkan madzhab salaf dan aqidah ahlu sunnah walillahi al hamdu tentang masalah iman
4966264 terkadang ada didalam ucapan syaikh al albani bahwa kekufuran itu dengan juhud dan takdzib maka sebagian orang 14 memahami bahwa syaikh rahimahullahu menyempitkan kekufu ran hanya pada juhud atau takdzib saja dan meniadakan macam macam kekafi ran yang lainnya seperti kufur iba istikbar sombong imtina menolak syak nifak dan selainnya
4966265 telah disebutkan oleh para ulama rohimahumullahu perincian hal hal yang bisa mengeluarkan seorang hamba dari islam dan semua itu kembalinya kepada juhud pengingkaran terhadap apa yang dibawa rasul baik secara keseluruhan atau sebahagiannya
4966266 barangsiapa dari kalangan fuqoha yang memutlakkan menyatakan bahwa tidak kafir kecuali yang juhudl menentang kewajibannya maka yang dia maksud dengan juhud tersebut telah mencakup takdzib akan kewajibannya dan imtina ketika mengucapkannya
4966267 sebagian orang menebarkan syubuhat tentang aqidah al allamah syaikh muhammad nashiruddin al albani hafizhahullahu dan mereka menisbatkan kepada beliau sebagai kelompok sesat seperti murjiah apa ucapan nasehat anda terhadap mereka
4966268 syaikh nashiruddin al albani termasuk saudara saudara kita ahli hadits yang terkenal dari kalangan ahli sunnah wal jamaah
4966269 berkata sebagian orang sesungguhnya syaikh al albani rahimahullahu ucapannya dalam masalah iman adalah ucapan murjiah bagaimana menurut pendapat anda
4966270 aku katakan kepada kalian sebagaimana yang dikatakan oleh orang terdahulu
4966271 barangsiapa yang menuduh syaikh al albani dengan murjiah maka dia telah keliru
4966272 orang orang munafik yaitu orang orang yang mencela orang orang mukmin yang memberi sedekah dengan sukarela dan mencela orang orang yang tidak memperoleh untuk disedekahkan selain sekedar kesanggupannya
4966273 syaikh al albani seorang alim besar ahli hadits terkenal pembela sunnah aqidah beliau benar dan beliau memiliki perjuangan dalam aqidah
4966274 syaikh al albani adalah pembela sunnah mencela syaikh al albani berarti mencela sunnah
4966275 cukuplah alloh sebagai pelindung dan penolong kami bagaimana bisa orang yang selama hidupnya memerangi bidah dan para pelakunya dituduh sebagai murjiah

4966315 wahai orang orang yang beriman jika kalian bertaqwa kepada alloh maka alloh akan memberi kalian furqon dan akan menggugurkan kesalahan kesalahan kalian serta mengampuni dosa dosa kalian sesungguhnya alloh mempunyai karunia yang besar
4966316 wahai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dan berimanlah kepada rosul nya niscaya allah memberikan rahmat nya kepada kalian dua bagian dan menjadikan untuk kalian cahaya yang dengan cahaya itu kalian berjalan dan dia mengampuni kalian dan allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang

4966376 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said brambell
4966377 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4966378 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
4966379 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4966380 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4966381 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us

4966463 chaves ha dicho p blicamente que est disponible a acudir si el psoe se lo pide y hasta que lo decidan los ciudadanos
4966464 no hay ning n dirigente de andaluc a que est instalado en ese objetivo de plantear una discusi n sobre la sucesi n del presidente de la junta porque hay unas reglas de juego que hay que respetar y el momento de la discusi n es 2011
4966465 queremos ganar y tenemos la responsabilidad de elegir al mejor candidato ya que para ganar no basta con un buen trabajo de cuatro a os y cumplir sino que la persona que vaya a representar socialmente al partido sea una persona que sume a la marca

4966469 i think the public understands that if there is any evidence of excessive force we will do something to address it
4966470 ive got five kids man we live in the same house i have kids running around everywhere
4966471 he said i can drink a little bit chase it down with water
4966472 i was about to pull over but he kept trying to open the door
4966473 i didnt take him to get any drugs i didnt see him do any drugs
4966474 he said 2334 would you please help me he held onto the gate yelling help me dont kill me he seemed to give up and doubled back up hawthorne then turned down hawthorne again
4966475 i thought he was going to bust the door down
4966476 was holding his hand or arm like he hurt his hand or got a cut
4966477 the lady tasered him and then they cuffed him it looked like he was halfway on the curb and they stomped on him or something and you could see him on the pavement and they stepped on his back
4966478 appear to show that he was struck or hit in a way that shows he was defending himself
4966479 of course we cant say for sure who injured him
4966480 but it appears that some time close to his death within hours or maybe minutes someone beat him
4966481 he has too many injuries and bruising and swelling to have not been beaten
4966482 beat up is a subjective term sure so is excessive force youve seen the photographs so i cant say there was no trauma
4966483 i want people to understand what happened to this guy but i want a complete picture
4966484 i really just cant add it all up yet because i still dont have key pieces of evidence
4966485 if you do have hypothetically an episode of excited delirium weve been told that you shouldnt use pain inducing techniques to control the subject things like bean bags batons etc

4966529 they havent been put to rest at all theyre just getting stronger
4966530 reformulation of the old argument for the existence of god that says where there is a design there must be a designer
4966531 just because you dont see at first how something could be the product of natural selection doesnt mean it couldnt be such challenges should spur a scientist to look deeper not tell him its time to retire and just attribute something to the work of an intelligent designer
4966532 just because you can trace an idea back to antiquity does not in and of itself make that idea invalid does it
4966533 because a theory belongs to an individual of a certain faith doesnt make that theory invalid does it
4966534 it would be a fallacy to say that a scientific theory was invalid just because it comes from one particular tradition or another wouldnt it
4966535 and yet you have said today that they are the same are they the same or not
4966536 there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved

4966539 he missed the boat completely we didnt need genomics to demonstrate evolution but having genomic sequences of different species nails down the big idea that the more recently that two forms shared a common ancestor the more alike they are in anatomy biochemistry embryology behavior and genetics and it does so beautifully and quantitatively

4966543 if you are nothing but an accident of nature then nothing you do is dependent on objective truth
4966544 you can set your own rules there is no life after death there are no set moral codes if you go to bed and if you die its ok youre just another piece of matter bouncing around and youll change into something else thats why even if 100 million scientists say we are unplanned that were just purposeless beings in this universe the general population wont buy it and neither will i
4966545 einstein thought the big bang was wrong because it didnt fit his metaphysics
4966546 but he was the one who was wrong should it have been illegal to discuss the big bang in schools just because it was consistent with christianity
4966547 they are distinguished scientists doing credible experimental work and they have found evidence of intelligent design in the empirical data that they see
4966548 if the evidence suggests design well should they ignore it
4966549 is based on observed empirical physical evidence from nature and it is definitely science
4966550 i concluded that based on theological philosophical and historical facts
4966551 what is science and what is not science is merely a convention
4966552 it can be challenged and changed at will by scientists themselves and scientists are the products of their culture too
4966553 look scientists dont sit there and ask am i doing science or not no scientist is going to say this is empirical truth about the wrong subject so im not going to study it no they look at whatever the empirical data is and draw conclusions from it
4966554 so you want to change the definition of science to include the supernatural

4966558 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4966559 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago

4966571 we come to bear a message of brotherhood and peace for all the people of kirkuk kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
4966572 the issue of kirkuk is very clear there is a constitution approved by the majority of the people of iraq there is article 140 in this constitution related to kirkuk article 140 of the constitution will not be cancelled until all its provisions are implemented
4966573 we believe that the kurdistan region is a region for all kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
4966574 this resolution of the current conflict is first and foremost the responsibility of the people of kirkuk outsiders can only have a helping role however i think there are some external people who are trying to manipulate this internal process to determine the fate of kirkuk for their own ends

4966628 the n h marine debris to energy project is a successful joint venture between public and private organizations who have recognized the need to mitigate marine debris on the shore underwater and out in the ocean
4966629 by looking at the big picture and taking the time to identify and monitor marine debris we can gain a better understanding of what makes up ocean based debris develop plans to implement a cleanup program and help create a solution through education and outreach
4966630 what we have discovered is that derelict fishing gear and other marine debris in the ocean and along the coast has the potential to impact a broad range of the marine ecosystem from the marine industries that use coastal waterways and beaches to the organisms that reside within them
4966631 marine debris is a hazard to water craft navigation and can pose a threat to life and property when encountered at sea
4966632 this project was started to continue the important cleanup efforts and help put a stop to ocean based debris
4966633 we are aware that the majority of debris found at beach cleanups in new hampshire comes from ocean based sources so if we can enlist the support and help of the fishermen to help bring in what they find at sea waste management can help them dispose of it properly
4966634 we are very proud to be a part of this great effort to help reduce the amount of debris collect data about what makes up the debris and provide training and outreach on how to best handle marine debris in the future
4966635 were happy to report that getting the help of local fishermen was not a tough sell
4966636 it really is a benefit to them and their livelihood to do everything they can to diminish marine debris and keep the oceans as clean as possible
4966637 by encouraging them to bring lost gear found at sea and by locating these dumpsters and recycling bins at a convenient location this effort can certainly diminish the debris which is potentially harmful to wildlife people vessels and the economy
4966638 this is the first time fishermen have had a place to deposit derelict fishing gear
4966639 we certainly hope this project and educational programs developed can be used as templates for other areas in developing data collection procedures and outreach strategies for marine debris reduction

4966641 to effectively get rid of privacy union bosses can stand over workers shoulders and use coercion its bad enough that workers will lose their right to privacy but it will tilt the whole political spectrum to the left when it comes to labor politics
4966642 its left up to the employer whether or not an election is held they hold all the power they can intimidate workers to force them from forming a bargaining unit its time to bring back the middle class
4966643 everything from television radio and print ads to a youtube page web advertising and a substantial grassroots organizing effort
4966644 its the most important issue in the election to us
4966645 but that doesnt mean we cant continue to run ads that address the issue
4966646 ive heard that from other folks he was intended to be intimidating but the whole card check things is intimidating the question is how do you educate someone in 30 seconds on an issue you can bring a voter to water but you cant make them go further if they dont want to
4966647 and they told me i would be welcomed to buy an ad
4966648 who tie things up to try to prevent us from coming in
4966649 to bargain with their employers for better wages and benefits

4966655 josh is the best offensive lineman ive seen in a while
4966656 hes got the height and the weight technically hes just perfect
4966657 everyone was always telling me get your kick slides in youre big enough to be a tackle i kind if figured it was going to get to that point
4966658 i always ate a lot and then it got to the point where i had to eat more
4966659 i was like theres no way in hell i can eat more but you find a way you sneak in extra meals here and there
4966660 i got my foot caught in the turf id torn my acl before so i knew what it felt like
4966661 at first the training staff was torn i almost went back out and played but it didnt feel right and we were beating them at the time
4966662 were healthy weve got four of five returning starters plus tom neill at center and tight end scott sicko when we have been successful on offense weve been able to run the ball
4966663 he hadnt played a lot of football because he was too big for pop warner
4966664 he hadnt had time to grow into his body but he did two things he worked his ass off in the weight room and he worked on the skills we wanted him to work on
4966665 my mom loved the coaches the facilities and the way things were done here
4966666 i loved it and when i conferred with her after my visit she said i want you to commit now she really pushed me to come here
4966667 i really like the family atmosphere coach mac still always asks me about how my parents are doing how my sisters doing
4966668 julio todo esto que hacemos est muy bien pero lo que estamos consiguiendo es engrasar el sistema y perpetuarlo
4966669 you have courage so let it take over for you now
4966670 dont force your heart to bear the whole burden let your courage be the searchlight
4966671 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4966672 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4966673 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4966674 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4966675 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4966676 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4966677 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4966678 the columns are moving from the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali to russia
4966679 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4966680 we were the first in so well be the last out
4966681 it has not started yet what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4966682 i think nova seafoods the team to beat theyre solid they dont make any mistakes but were here
4966683 we kicked the ball around a little bit but we had solid pitching and some timely hitting
4966684 last game i think we had two hits the whole game we just didnt hit the ball and we werent in it mentally

4966686 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4966687 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4966688 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4966689 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4966690 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4966691 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4966692 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4966693 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4966694 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4966695 every single radio station that we gave handlebars to their initial reaction was oh hell no
4966696 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4966697 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4966698 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4966699 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4966700 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4966701 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

4966712 recorded music is nothing but marketing material to drive awareness of an artist
4966713 terrestrial stations normal fm am stations pay nothing a tribute to their powerful corporate parents with limitless lobbying budgets
4966714 im reluctantly willing to sacrifice pandora if it quickens the inevitable march of recorded music towards free
4966715 the music industry says internet radio stations have no one but themselves to blame and suggest they find more innovative revenue models

4966717 so why are you guys interested in talking to me im no peter drucker im just a cartoonist
4966718 because we like your very atypical point of view we think it could perhaps be useful to us
4966719 well im finding it pretty darn interesting so far but at the end of the day if michael dell doesnt grok it theres not much i can do from what my gut tells me it seems like its very much his company even more so than bill gates and microsoft i could be wrong but there it is of course if he does end up grokking it then itll get pretty intense pretty quickly but in a good way

4966725 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4966726 you cant get caught up on how a teams going good or bad
4966727 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
4966728 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
4966729 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4966730 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4966731 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
4966732 it was earthy and warm and i knew exactly how id design it
4966733 people need to be with their pets in order for them to heal
4966734 the owners are nervous the pets dont understand whats happening its important that they have a place thats warm
4966735 i want this to be a calming place for them
4966736 so they can see out they may be contagious but that doesnt mean they should be isolated completely
4966737 they didnt want a cold sterile place we were very much in sync that way
4966738 if you have good drying weather and no humidity you can cut it early one morning and bale it the following afternoon
4966739 ive had the best year ever we got all our first crop off early then we fertilized and we have a great second crop thats almost ready to cut when the rains came we were all done
4966740 as long as that hay is sitting on the ground its going to be sucking the moisture right up out of the ground
4966741 most of it is grown by dairy producers followed by livestock producers
4966742 most of these operations have a little extra they can sell to other farms first and foremost when we have a reduction in the crop that means that most of these farms are going to have to buy some feed to replace what they havent been able to grow
4966743 now its getting to the point where the days are going to get shorter
4966744 ive bailed second crops in october but the days are so short then you have to have five full days of sun so the gamble is real high
4966745 we were already dead in the water before we even got started
4966746 if thats the case hay will be running seven to eight dollars a bale out of the barn never mind delivery youre going to be looking at 10 a bale delivered
4966747 its an excellent quality feed but it just means theres less dry hay available
4966748 i want to make sure people know that this is something we do every night
4966749 you can see everything that happened everything the staff did as a precaution until they leave the parking lot what happens after that i cant control anymore
4966750 he was a nice clean cut american boy ive known the powers family for years and theyre the kind of family thats always giving back to the community you dont see that too often

4966755 everyones buzzing they the players dont think we can get beat by anyone
4966756 we are really provoked and motivated to bring home that gold
4966757 we are not far from it two games more and hopefully we can do it
4966758 the 1996 olympics was such a big event for nigeria
4966759 i watched those games like 10 times even after the tournament i had recordings of them and used to play them often
4966760 i dont believe that actually myself i am so close to it if i get that medal i dont know how ill feel but definitely it is going to be a great feeling
4966761 theres hope from our country and other african countries hoping that we can go and make africa proud
4966762 even when we beat the ivory coast they were saying good luck to us hoping that we can go on and win this
4966763 it would be nice if an african team can win it but there are other teams in this tournament south americans as well so its going to be tough really tough

4966770 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
4966771 is fulfilling the wish that all of us have to make reality to our liking
4966772 this faked photograph actually created the assumption people kind of remember him as there
4966773 thats the nature of the photograph its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true
4966774 its the only picture of my dad and me together
4966775 if the only reason i can get one is cropping it in it still means the same to me

4966803 thanks to the information shared by doe runs matthew pratt teachers participating in the four week long program and their current and future students will have a much better understanding of the importance of lead in todays society
4966804 of special interest to the teachers was how lead particularly from spent automotive batteries is recycled and can be used over and over and over again its a success story that most of the public has not heard
4966805 lead tends to get a bad rap but it is a metal that is vital to our everyday lives

4966808 construction of this pilot facility will allow our company to take the next step toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol
4966809 in the past few months our scientists have been able to achieve significant ethanol percentages in fermentation and improve the yield of ethanol from biomass additionally in our work with farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers we had a very successful harvest of corn cobs last fall and anticipate further advances during an expanded harvest this fall

4966817 the government will not charge allens son mark allen or other family members of allen with any criminal offense arising out of the governments investigation or that have been disclosed to the government
4966818 he put it in there that was in the plea agreement but i dont know that his kids were really in any jeopardy
4966819 he took a pretty big haircut because of all of this
4966820 whatever people think of the events of 2006 the fact is that allen built the company going from nothing to a company that was doing a billion worth of business and then he had to sell at a fire sale price because of all the trouble he got in

4966841 ive come a long way since world championships 18 months ago and im really proud of the way ive applied myself to my swimming

4966843 its something i am not going to get into his past is his past its not for me to worry about
4966844 he was a competitor on the blocks today in relation to the rules he abided by them he did a good race and good on him
4966845 this year was difficult because of the penalty i got but i thank god for the talent ive been given
4966846 in the finals you never know what can happen you could get last or first
4966847 in the olympic games anything can happen it was a miracle and for once the miracle was for me
4966848 he took the initiative on the lap when grant was breathing to the right side and he was breathing to the left side and put a gap in them that grant really tried hard to close and just couldnt quite get there
4966849 thats crazy you dont know nothing about no lion taming
4966850 well ok answer me this when one of those lions comes at you all roaring and biting what you gonna do
4966851 well then i take that big chair they all carry and ill stick it in his face until he backs down
4966852 well what if the lion takes that big paw and hooks the chair with them big claws and throws that chair out of the cage what do you do then
4966853 well then i takes that whip they all carry and ill whip him and whip him until he backs down
4966854 well what if that lion bites that whip with his big teeth and bites it in two what you gonna do then
4966855 well then ill take that gun they all carry and shoot him
4966856 well what if that gun doesnt work what will you do then
4966857 well then ill pick up some of the sh t thats on the bottom of the cage and i throw it in his eyes and i run out of the cage
4966858 well what if there aint no sh t in the bottom of the cage what you gonna do then
4966859 well thats dumb cause if that lion comes at me and he throws the chair out of the cage and he bites the whip in two and my gun dont work theres going to be some sh t on the bottom of that cage you can damn well bet on that
4966860 my wifes going to have her baby in the cab

4966865 some have observed that the problem with that report was it came out at a time of change in leadership in the organization and the administration it was birthed if you will by the clinton administration under secretary bruce babbitt and parks director bob staton
4966866 it completed its work in transition and reported essentially to the park service when there was a new administration and explicitly the leadership of the new institution was very reluctant and explicitly stated so in addressing its recommendations
4966867 so there was a transition issue we believe we have a different context here since we are reporting at the beginning of a new administration and are delighted by the interest of key people throughout the park service right now in this opportunity
4966868 i think the commission is very strong and were pretty satisfied with it
4966869 we will continue in any way we can to support the commission and to help in any way we can we will continue to make our concerns and possible solutions known to the commission such as via our
4966870 to consider the circumstances today of the parks offer a vision for the role of parks in society in the future and propose a program of actions to accomplish that vision
4966871 what you see when you look at the evolution of the park idea is growth greater diversity a diversity that reflects changing ideas a broadening of the culture of society new knowledge and research about the importance of natural systems the importance of parks and protected areas in preserving stressed natural systems
4966872 so theres a fair prospect that this commission will offer thoughts about growth i would not be surprised whatsoever
4966873 i dont know about decommissioning weve seen that touched over the years now and then by this group that leader or this body and it may come up i dont know the key thing here is we have a group of very prominent and thoughtful people and anticipating a lot of energy around all conservations well see what they have to say
4966874 we have a very clear sense of the importance of the key audiences which is the congress the national park service and potentially a new administration
4966875 we anticipate also in an outreach program that we will engage the general public and interest groups significantly in this conversation
4966876 the numbers at our huts are up about 5 percent and we are seeing more southern tier visitors
4966877 im surprised at the number of people who still ask where the old man is
4966878 at first i thought it was a joke but tit turns out that these are people who live in the bedroom communities of manchester and nashua and work in massachusetts
4966879 i kind of just want to be with my mom

4966881 i appeal to the government to stand behind these farming families here today and support them
4966882 i dont think australia really understands the extent of the devastation the impact the drought has had on farmers its not over
4966883 if you have one bad year it takes three or four years to recover from that we had had two bad years in a row
4966884 societys attitude about sex needs to change you have to go to the root source and with politicians being caught paying for hookers or with their pants down in the office and then trying to lie their way out of it well were just reinforcing the idea that most men dont respect women its more subtle than it used to be but its still there
4966885 you want the pretty picture were showing you to come real the give us more money
4966886 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4966887 the kitchen includes a variety of features that will appeal to a handicapped military veteran
4966888 the electric range has front controls the dishwasher has a tall tub and the refrigerator is designed for easy access for both the refrigeration and the freezer sections of the appliance the sink area allows easy access for a person in a wheelchair drawers include loop handles while the lazy susan actually comes out of its cabinet a cabinet with no shelves has been placed between the range and the refrigerator to allow a person in a wheelchair the ability to take items from either appliances and then prepare the food items on a countertop that doubles as a table
4966889 we created a separate room with direct access to the master bedroom and the master bathroom that includes a washer and dryer as well as closet space
4966890 frigidaire donated a front controlled washer and a front controlled dryer this will allow the homeowner to take dirty clothes directly from the two most likely locations a bathroom and a bedroom and do all of their laundry and then hang up their clothes all in one room
4966891 design is to produce a design to design a design
4966892 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4966893 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4966894 do you know all homos are going to burn in hell
4966895 the columns are moving from the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali to russia
4966896 you must understand there are a large amount of troops

4966898 it has not started yet what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4966899 the tv center in gori has been blown up and they are now broadcasting russian radio
4966900 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
4966901 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
4966902 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realize their wishes and dreams
4966903 newly minted or well seasoned teaching you how to you create and grow your legal practice
4966904 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4966905 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4966906 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4966907 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4966908 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4966909 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4966910 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4966911 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4966912 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4966913 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4966914 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4966915 you are going to college in the midst of a psychedelic renaissance
4966916 you are going to college in the midst of a cultural renaissance
4966917 for me individually i was very much in my head
4966918 the antidote to hitler is the study of the deep psyche
4966919 rick is one of the most motivated students i ever had
4966920 and his lifes goal very clearly is to get psychedelics approved for therapeutic medication
4966921 he has a good feel for dealing with people he was more militant when he was younger
4966922 now he knows how government works and his organizational skills are better and he knows how to make friends with his opponents
4966923 the idea of going to the fda and getting psychedelic drugs approved was never seriously pursued by the drug reform movement
4966924 i cant take the visions he proposes and walk over to a congressional office with them
4966925 rick stands alone with his childrens access positions theres almost no real support for that anywhere
4966926 the hysteria about kids and drugs is what drives the drug war today
4966927 in the 1960s it was all about a cultural rebellion but today its all about fear
4966928 its amazing to me the number of people who smoke marijuana and hide it from their kids because its illegal education is the real key its essential this should be a decision of the parents not the government prohibition denies parents the opportunity to have an honest conversation with their kids about making responsible choices
4966929 decreased fear and anxiety increased openness trust and interpersonal closeness
4966930 these people become very sleepy theyre almost not present and it doesnt completely eliminate the pain
4966931 but the combination of mdma and opiates brings people back to alertness and then opens up their access to their emotions and reduces pain
4966932 but will it present a clinical value that significantly exceeds what we already have out there i dont think mdma is unique or that it will produce a magic bullet
4966933 ten million dollars aint gonna do it hell need hundreds of millions of dollars even if hes allowed to keep going
4966934 i think people are ready for a new conversation about the therapeutic value of psychedelics
4966935 to go from here to there really requires a politically powerful medical professional and the mass media to get on top of it and stay on top of it
4966936 der har i l bet af ugen v ret en del kritik mod politiet men vi sagde at vi var fortr stningsfulde og at vi med dygtigt politiarbejde ville komme efter det jeg retter en stor ros til de meget dygtige politifolk for et dygtigt og t lmodigt arbejde
4966937 min st rste fejltagelse og jeg har v ret et meget ufuldkomment menneske er at mit f rste gteskab gik i stykker
4966938 jeg havde en sv r ungdom og der var perioder hvor jeg eksperimenterede med stoffer
4966939 det er en hellig forening mellem en kvinde og mand

4966941 the goal of the entire collection is to offer pieces that can work together and which can be dressed up or dressed down so the consumer can build a look all her own and continue to enjoy and add new and complementary pieces as they are introduced
4966942 with so many marriages in crisis and many couples desperate for godly help we are pleased and excited to offer these resources and partner with churches and retailers to strengthen marriages
4966943 the potential of this film and the fireproof your marriage curriculum to deeply minister to and heal relationships is enormous
4966944 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
4966945 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
4966946 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
4966947 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4966948 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4966949 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4966950 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4966951 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4966952 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4966953 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4966954 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4966955 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4966956 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4966957 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4966958 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4966959 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4966960 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4966961 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4966962 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4966963 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4966964 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4966965 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4966966 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4966967 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4966968 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4966969 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4966970 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4966971 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4966972 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4966973 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4966974 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4966975 hoy damos inicio a esta feria de la salud y vamos tener tres d as de actividad intensa ya tuvimos la primeras visitas de las mujeres interesadas en participar todos estos servicios se ofrecer n en paquete

4966977 todas estas pacientes las hemos enviado al hospital general donde se les pr ctica los estudios confirmatorios hasta la fecha llevamos 53 casos de c ncer cervicouterino y 18 de mama los que ya han sido atendidos
4966978 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4966979 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4966980 to teach and to hold an administrative post are two different experiences altogether many times when a teacher who has been in the profession for ages is promoted to an administrative post it becomes a challenging task
4966981 this is why i think a course like this which will basically help a teacher cope with the new portfolio and train him or her starting with the most senior teachers first because they are most likely to get promoted first into such a post would be helpful since du conducts so many short term courses from time to time i think this if implemented will be great
4966982 the university officials felt that if professors of the university can help students whether at the undergraduate or postgraduate level improve their language skills then they neednt go to some coaching centre
4966983 the university will charge a minimal fee of rs 2 500 for the entire course forty students have already signed up for the course and now many university staff have also come up to us to conduct similar courses for them
4966984 there are some professors whose lectures in a particular subject are considered the best ill has taken the initiative of having video lectures of those professors in our labs so that all students can take advantage of his or her lectures
4966985 en dat was nodig deze zege heeft ons heel veel deugd gedaan

4967001 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4967002 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4967003 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4967004 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4967005 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4967006 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4967007 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4967008 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4967009 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions

4967025 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4967026 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4967079 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4967080 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4967081 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4967082 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4967083 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4967084 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4967085 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4967086 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4967087 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4967088 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4967089 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4967090 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4967091 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4967092 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4967093 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4967094 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4967095 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4967096 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4967097 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4967102 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4967103 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4967104 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4967105 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4967106 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4967107 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4967108 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias

4967114 no vi el r cord hasta dar la vuelta de honor
4967115 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4967116 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4967117 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4967118 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4967119 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4967120 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4967121 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4967128 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4967129 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4967130 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4967131 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4967132 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4967133 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4967134 they are in the right markets with the right products you have to like that and you have to like a company that has executed so well
4967135 will you please pick up a few jugs of water and some bags of ice for yourselves
4967136 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4967137 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4967138 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4967139 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4967140 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4967141 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4967142 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4967143 the goal of ddm to launch a campaign like the six ethics of the mind is that every one in society will practice and as a result influence others for the purpose of building a pure land on earth
4967144 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4967145 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4967146 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4967147 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4967148 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4967149 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4967150 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4967151 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4967152 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4967153 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4967154 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4967155 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4967156 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4967157 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4967246 and when iain said go for it we all committed everything we had
4967247 we had to find a little something extra to get beyond them
4967248 we were just hoping the scales would tip in our favour
4967249 it was a hard race and i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half but i just couldnt be happier

4967251 it was really hard to compete on the last day and the teams been so supportive

4967275 the role of greenhouse gases is to cool the atmosphere and this with the surface warming from solar radiation generates convective instability
4967276 the ipccs most recent assessment attempts to be helpful to the casual enquirer by having a series of explanations for frequently asked questions or faqs
4967277 the reason the earths surface is this warm is the presence of greenhouse gases which act as a partial blanket for the longwave radiation coming from the earths surface this blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse effect
4967278 much of the thermal radiation emitted by the land and the ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere including clouds and reradiated back to earth this is called the greenhouse effect
4967279 a credible explanation has no need for smoke and mirrors the energy flow through the climate system is predominantly by way of four stages 1 absorption of solar radiation at the surface 2 conduction of heat and evaporation of latent energy from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer 3 convective overturning that distributes heat and latent energy through the troposphere and 4 radiation of energy from the atmosphere to space we will see that it is the characteristics of convective overturning that keep the surface warmer than it would otherwise be the kiehl and trenberth 1997 global average energy budget of the earth see figure where the units are w m 2 is used by the ipcc and is a useful starting point for explanation of the establishment and maintenance of the greenhouse effect of the 340 units of solar radiation entering the earths atmosphere 67 are absorbed by the atmosphere and 168 are absorbed at the surface there is thus an ongoing source of solar energy available to the atmosphere and the surface at the surface there is a net accumulation of radiation energy because the incoming solar radiation 168 units exceeds the net loss of longwave radiation 66 units in the atmospheric layer there is absorption of 417 units 390 of emission from the surface less 40 that go directly to space plus absorption of 67 of solar radiation and an emission of 519 units 324 back to the surface and 195 direct emission to space the net effect of the interaction between the greenhouse gases and radiation is a tendency to cool the atmosphere because it is continually losing energy overall there is a dichotomy with radiation processes firstly tending to warm the earths surface and secondly tending to cool the atmosphere air is an excellent insulator against conduction of heat and will not transfer heat through the atmosphere as is necessary for energy balance also the thermodynamic properties of air potential temperature increases with height ensure that turbulent motions of the atmosphere will mix energy downward not upward as required the process for transferring energy from the surface to the atmosphere necessary to achieve overall energy balance of the climate system was explained by herbert riehl and joanne malkus the latter better known as joanne simpson in a 1958 paper on the heat balance of the equatorial trough zone geophysica riehl and malkus noted that boundary layer air rising buoyantly in the protected updraughts of deep tropical convection clouds converts heat and latent energy to potential energy away from the convection compensating subsidence converts potential energy to heat what is implied in the riehl and malkus model is that deep tropical convection and the transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere will not take place without buoyant updraughts within deep convection clouds that is there is a need for the temperature of the atmosphere to decrease with altitude and that the rate of decrease of temperature must be sufficient to allow buoyancy of the air ascending in the updraughts from well known thermodynamic laws the rate of decrease of temperature must be at least 6 5oc km to allow the buoyancy forces of convection to overcome the natural stratification of the atmosphere the climate system will come into energy equilibrium when temperatures are such that the net solar radiation absorbed is balanced by the longwave radiation to space at equilibrium the greenhouse effect ie that the average surface temperature of 14oc is greater than the 19oc blackbody emission temperature of earth is an outcome from the need for convective overturning of the atmosphere
4967280 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4967281 a desire to fight until the very final whistle is the starting point for everything else
4967282 we have a very good squad of players who believe in this goal and thus its where everything starts because more matches where we go behind will come and we must be prepared for them
4967283 the feeling of grabbing this victory after the players refused to quit and instead made a final effort

4967291 el mayor problema de espa a con la crisis es un gobierno que niega su existencia
4967292 i played a good match but the important thing is that i now have the stamina to be on the field for the entire 90 minutes
4967293 i felt good and the knee didnt give me any problems i am improving and havent had any setbacks well have to keep an eye on the knee for a little while longer but the worst is behind me
4967294 bastian is not fully fit and after an hour he was having a few difficulties
4967295 i wanted some fresh legs and knew andreas ottl would be able to get a few more touches of the ball in midfield
4967296 we have all our players at different stages of fitness and bastian started training particularly late and has even been ill so has borowski who was injured and luca toni and martin demichelis have been out longer
4967297 miro has played all of euro 2008 and simply is not at the level that we want him to be at
4967298 if we have an opportunity to strengthen we will seize it
4967299 whats more if nobody comes the lads in the reserve team will have a good chance of stepping upm which is also good
4967300 the most important thing is that leo finishes the tournament in good shape and in as good health as is possible
4967301 there are no problems for his eu passport application but we are waiting for the response from the authorities
4967302 we need to sit tight and await news fernandez has received many proposals from european clubs but his mind is focused only on lazio
4967303 however it would be impossible to join them if he remained a non eu player
4967304 every season is a season when you have to win something but the difference between winning and losing is very small at the moment
4967305 the two massive trophies are the premier league and the champions league we were close in both competitions last season so lets go and try again we want to win things but had we made 70 points and won the carling cup people would have said for me it is not satisfying
4967306 we will not play every year like last year and lose out in the end we have to reconsider and play exactly the same
4967307 what is dreadful when you are a big club is to be out of the title race in september that is why it is so important to get a good start
4967308 hes long gone levys been hopping between bulgaria and russia trying to find berba so they can sell him and massaging zenits ego so theyd release arshavin on time its a tricky period at spurs what with ramos trying to get his new charges adjusted to playing for such a stylish side and worse trying to get berbas double to score a goal and a half
4967309 ya tuhanku berilah aku petunjuk agar ku dapat mensyukuri nikmatmu yang telah engkau limpahkan kepadaku dan kepada kedua orangtuaku dan agar aku dapat berbuat kebajikan yang akan mengalir sampai ke anak cucuku
4967310 mereka agak terkejut dengan kehadiran saya namun menyambutnya dengan baik
4967311 i was able to get a sense of his soul
4967312 i looked into his eyes and saw three letters a k a g and a b
4967313 immediately consult with the ukrainian government and other concerned countries on steps to secure their continued independence
4967314 the u s should immediately consult with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tiblisi ceyhan oil pipeline
4967315 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
4967316 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops
4967317 im bored here im going to move to the usa

4967320 bella stronza perch forse io ti ho dato troppo amore
4967321 we were looking fine in the first 25 minutes but we dropped our heads after the first goal
4967322 the other two goals were disappointing they came from set pieces and were were naive in both situations
4967323 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game but they are a great side
4967324 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4967325 arsenal were flowing and we had a few problems down the right side and they capitalised on that but once we sorted out the problems we performed a lot better
4967326 there are a lot of positives to take from the game we dont go away hammered and go away believing we can compete in this league but there is plenty to work to do
4967327 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4967328 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4967329 before the game we said to the players that fulham didnt travel too well last season and we tried to exploit their weaknesses
4967330 we stuck to a gameplan and the substitutions changed the game late on
4967331 im really happy because there werent many times last season we came from behind to win
4967332 could i have asked for more i would have liked a clean sheet as those are going to be very important this season
4967333 he gives us something that we perhaps didnt have last season a little bit of quality in the middle
4967334 he has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team
4967335 he added something that people wanted from him in france and that was to score goals
4967336 he started to score some goals towards the end of last season and had a scoring start here today
4967337 we made a good start were always in control but could not finish the game off
4967338 you have that old story in the game when you cannot finish the game off you feel you deserved to be punished when theres 10 minutes to go
4967339 i am pleased with the fact that we didnt concede a goal we scored two on wednesday one today so its better than the reverse
4967340 what kind of media contains the image to be installed
4967341 pemisah di antara kita dan mereka orang kafir adalah sholat barangsiapa meninggalkanyya maka sungguh dia telah kafir
4967342 barang siapa bertemu allah sedang ia mengabaikan sholat maka allah sama sekali tidak akan memperdulikan kebaikannya
4967343 barang siapa meninggalkan sholat dengan sengaja maka terlepas sudah darinya jaminan muhammad
4967344 sesungguhnya urusan kalian yang paling penting bagiku adalah sholat barang siapa yang memeliharanya berarti ia telah memelihara agamanya barangsiapa yang melalaikanya maka pasti ia lebih melalaikan amal ibadah yang lainnya tidak ada bagian dalam islam bagi orang yang meninggalkan sholat
4967345 setelah isya aku bersama umar bin khattab ra pergi ke rumah abu bakar shidiq ra untuk suatu keperluan
4967346 ahh andaikan saja aku dapat hidup terus untuk melihat apa yang di perbuat oleh umatku untuk sholat
4967347 duhai tuhanku engkau adalah waliku bagi umatku maka perlakuan mereka sesuai sifat mu dan jangan perlakukan mereka sesuai perbuatan mereka
4967348 ya rasulullah ayah dan ibuku menjadi tebusanmu apa gerangan yang terjadi mengapa engkau begitu sedih
4967349 benar wahai muhammad kelak diakhir zaman akan datang sekelompok manusia dari umatmu yang mengabaikan sholat mengakhirkan sholat hingga keluar dari waktunya dan memperturutkan hawa nafsu

4967355 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4967356 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it
4967357 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4967358 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4967359 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4967360 radiometric methodologies would have to be out by a factor of 3 4 of a million
4967361 polystrate trees prove several things 1 the layers that they penetrate did not take millions of years to form 2 coal does not take millions of years to form since polystrate trees sometimes penetrate multiple seams 3 coal is formed from floating trees not peat 4 the rock strata between the coal layers did not take millions of years to form 5 the fossils embedded within the strata do not represent millions of years of evolution
4967362 1 that is not all that hard to explain 2 hello one ringy dingy two ringy dingy i dont either apology accepted if that is what it was like i said we can move beyond kindergarten if you will stop throwing your bottle out of the crib and screaming for your binky
4967363 starlight has not arrived here after millions of years whether big bang or creation the stars have stretched out from a central point accelerated to where they are and continue to expand starlight cannot be used to date anything
4967364 the age of the universe has changed many times with the age of the earth at one time the sun was known to be 90 000 000 miles closer to earth than now claimed
4967365 the other side of the coin is that as of yet there is no evidence outside of manipulating the bible for a 6000 year old earth
4967366 so it is easily possible that a polystrate tree could form 300 million years ago and then have further deposits to complete the coal seams
4967367 also you have made a point that these trees do not have roots do you have any ideas because i dont this is a question for both sides of the camp to answer
4967368 no it is the peat layers being compressed that is a much more obvious conclusion this invalidate 1 to 5
4967369 where are these coal seams and you have yet to answer my question as to the lady involved with the
4967370 it questions the assumption that the speed of light has always been the same this is a reasonable assumption since we have absolutely no evidence that the speed of light has ever been different or even of any mechanisms that can increase the speed
4967371 if you had checked into the msh information you would already know what i was saying here i did not say that all of the logs sank to form the coal rather it appears that occasionally one sinks heavy end first to become a polystrate tree penetrating multiple strata but the coal itself is composed mostly of the bark that falls from the trees as they are moved to and fro by the violent action of wind waves and tides that is why the coal beds are thin and seldom more than a few feet in thickness logs embedded through coal seams are petrified permineralized coalified depending on temperature chemical conditions and sediment content yes the trees provide the carbon
4967372 i never manipulate the bible i take it as written
4967373 our camp has already answered the question the trees were floating not growing they had been ripped loose from the soil where they grew and many of them lacked not only roots and rootlets but the entire root ball violent global flood action is the only condition capable of producing such evidence on such a grand global scale
4967374 there was no evidence of a peat bog and nobody claimed that all of the logs were coalified nothing is invalidated
4967375 the flood waters were upon the earth for about a year most logs will float for more than a year bark that is rubbed off will not float for very long ive seen bays on the west coast full of floating logs and not a shred of bark on any of them i think the logs mostly ended up on top of the ground and rotted to form soil
4967376 im not your babysitter and im tired of you spitting your pablum all over the place if you had actually checked the links and read the quote your first question wouldnt have been asked and you wouldnt have been ignorant enough to word the second question the way you did
4967377 light has been manipulated like that in a lab because they are making it travel through different mediums which distort the speed of light while traveling through a vacuum like space the speed of light is constant the constant speed of light is one of the fundamental premises of special relativity
4967378 well there is no statement in the bible that says 5000 6000 years or whatever it is so you had to manipulate it
4967379 sorry for the cut and paste i know you dont like that sort of stuff but i was at work and had limited time i find that by using a scientists own words would be more credible to you apparently i was wrong but if you want to leave red shift alone fine by me it only works with the big bang any way and you seem to relise that thats a bad theory all around

4967382 i typed that out just for you youve used this term quite a bit and since its a key ingrediant in the scientific method that we have to observe what is happening the moment we stop observing and go only on a hypothisis or theory we are leaving the realm of science you would agree wouldnt you
4967383 lets see what we can observe even with the worlds most powerful telescope a star is still a dot of light
4967384 theres a good doc on it also another weird theory theres your favorite word is that the sun is hollow and close up examinations of sun spots reveal this but what do you care for such things being taught in a un classroom see robert muller you want to talk of the spped of light
4967385 roughly 8 min and 34 sec it takes to get here from the sun i remember that from school didnt look it up but as my brothers have already stated the speed of light is effected by gravity mass and acceleration a lab in i believe australia im guessing not gonna look it up just for you stopped light in a lab not just stopped it but speeded it up considering light exists as a particle and a ray it would be folly to think its speed is a constant but then again they said the speed of sound would never be broken just the fact that a black hole and no one really knows what one is can trap light clearly states that the speed is not a constant
4967386 oh cosmology is really a religon when you think about it i mean its all about where we came from and how everything began it just dosent claim one way is the only way
4967387 no doofus all i had to do was get out my calculator and add up the years in the genealogies duh contrived indeed the information about coal forming from bark has been around for years yet your crowd keeps pushing the peat bog fantasy which has never been proven to produce any quantity of coal get a life
4967388 well it was broadcast in the papers of the world and on every network
4967389 no that still only tells you that what your seeing is a dot of light there is no evidence anywhere that what we see has any corelation to our own sun and this in no way shows the size of the universe scientists keep looking for the edge of the universe and theyll never find it
4967390 plasma physics and the hollow sun would go along way to this forum it is called conclusive proof that evolution is a myth not the bible

4967393 the moment we stop observing and go only on a hypothisis or theory we are leaving the realm of science you would agree wouldnt you
4967394 how would it prove god how would it prove genesis

4967397 absolutely there is coal forming right now in the bottom of spirit lake show me where a peat bog is observed to be making coal please sounds like religion to me science is supposed to be based on repeatable experimentation and observation
4967398 ob ser va tion noun 1 an act or instance of noticing or perceiving 2 an act or instance of regarding attentively or watching 3 the faculty or habit of observing or noticing regarding perceived distance you should be advised that parallax trigonometry is capable of estimating distances to 100 ly at best and thats being generous talking about billions of light years as something that is measurable is an exercise in fantasy
4967399 god has his own ways of proving his existence omnipotence and omniscience through the use of microcodes macrocodes and metacodes he laid out the future of the universe before he created it and began laying out macrocodes with the naming of the first patriarchs for a good overview of the playing field see whos really pushing bad science and the dubious apologetics of hugh ross

4967405 exactly glad your coming around to my way of thinking
4967406 if there subject to massive peer review then why do most still use ernst haeckels fraudulent drawings and they still appear in classroom text books it seems that evolutionists continue to lie to the people even when they know there wrong ill admit that eventually they were tossed out and he lost his job but they crept back in didnt they i certainly learned it when i went to school and i was never told that they were wrong these drawings are still used and are even in museums know why because there such great tools to show evolution even though they know there fake not much peer review there or how about lucy the couple fragments of bone actually found were from different spots and different layers i believe every scientist would scoff at that but no even though every basic archaeology book says these cannot be from the same item creature due to layers and distance scientists didnt care not much peer review is there

4967491 no that still only tells you that what your seeing is a dot of light there is no evidence anywhere that what we see has any corelation to our own sun and this in no way shows the size of the universe scientists keep looking for the edge of the universe and theyll never find it

4967588 i gave tita king her first and last music theater piece
4967589 dr kasilag has consistently devoted herself to the pursuit of excellence specifically in music in her cultural leadership and interrelationships with students colleagues and friends her autobiography reflects her greatness as a person as she shares her joys and experiences with depth and meaning through her interactions with musical masters all over the world she exemplifies the artist as conscience of the world
4967590 we mourn the death of a great pillar of philippine music and culture long live tita king
4967591 i consider her an icon and of course during her years at ccp she initiated the formation of the young artists foundation the national music competition for young artists namcya and other programs which benefited young talents and that included me her years at the ccp was the golden age of the growth of all the arts specially music i will miss her presence in my concerts
4967592 tita king is the mother of all filipino artists during her healthy years she never missed a concert art exhibits book launching or any cultural event when i was doing my cultural research at eastman she practically mailed all her piano works and entrusted the interpretation of her music to me thats how giving she is
4967593 tita king is the philippine pioneer in the creation of filipino avante garde music this country i was her willing guinea pig in her experiments of vocal music which were then considered a novelty her original music and arrangements of folk songs always have an underpinning of humor which were reflective of her witty self underneath a scary bespectacled exterior
4967594 her innovative musical fusion of eastern and western technique form and style enriched philippine music without distracting from each others uniqueness
4967595 we in the orchestral music scene consider kasilags philippine scenes as one of the big four filipino orchestral works alongside buenaventuras by the hillside san pedros buwan sa kabundukan and penas igorot rhapsody
4967596 she is always hardworking and very focused i performed her folksongs in florence italy for my masters degree and her song cycle with prof regalado jose at the concert at the park id like to think she contributed a lot to the development of philippine music
4967597 about five years ago mowelfund honored her at the ccp
4967598 she cared and she gave her very all to the music industry
4967599 she was an amazingly ageless modern youthful and prolific artist she was my idol and ninang who inspired countless other artists she will live forever through her music
4967600 tita king inspired a whole generation of young musicians and it is but fitting that we dedicate this competition to her who was also one of the moving force behind this program for young artists
4967601 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
4967602 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
4967603 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4967604 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

4967606 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4967607 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that

4967609 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4967610 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4967611 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4967612 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4967613 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida

4967647 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling

4967689 se come scriveva henri bergson la ragion dessere della democrazia la fraternit occorre altres ammettere con lui che la democrazia per essenza evangelica ne scaturisce che nostro dovere offrire alla democrazia il contributo della nostra filosofia della nostra morale della nostra tradizione un contributo certamente molteplice e vario contraddistinto per dal cristianesimo elemento comune alla vita personale e sociale di tutti noi affermando che allorigine della civilt europea si trova il cristianesimo non si vuole introdurre alcun criterio confessionale esclusivo si vuole invece fare riferimento alle radici comuni delleuropa a quella morale unitaria che esalta la figura e la responsabilit della persona umana col suo fermento di fraternit evangelica
4967690 nel momento in cui gli stati uniti rivendicano con orgoglio la dimensione collettiva della loro esperienza religiosa lassenza di un richiamo al cristianesimo assumerebbe il significato di un imperdonabile atto di rimozione storica

4967695 itu adalah angin segar buatku karena terkadang sepakbola bisa membuat anda sinis satu sama lain dan anda lupa tentang hal yang benar benar penting aku menyadari apa yang penting ketika aku menerima surat dari pendukung west ham menyatakan belasungkawa
4967696 terkadang anda bisa lebih terhubung dengan orang orang yang pernah mengalami hal serupa dengan yang anda alami sendiri itu membuatku sadar kalau aku ada di lingkungan yang tepat
4967697 akan butuh waktu tapi aku ingin menulis balasan kepada setiap orang
4967698 membalas surat surat itu sangatlah penting karena walau aku sedang sedih saat membaca surat surat itu dan untuk sesaat mereka juga menambah kesedihanku itu semua sangat membantu

4967703 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4967704 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4967705 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4967706 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4967707 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4967708 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4967709 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4967710 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4967711 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
4967712 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4967713 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4967714 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4967715 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4967716 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4967717 approximately 30 individual properties or small groups of identified properties would sustain what are termed significant visual effects
4967718 a proportion of people living in small settlements like bearstone knighton dorrington and norton in hales would also sustain significant changes in their views
4967719 there is potential for noise nuisance and detriment to the amenity of the area to be experienced by occupiers of dwellings from the proposed noise sources
4967720 the previous consultation comments will still stand and be taken into account when the application is heard but all interested parties will get a further opportunity to comment on the revised plans
4967721 the turbines comply with the governments noise standards and will be fitted with shadow flicker control systems that will stop the turbines operating at times when the sun is low in the sky and the wind is blowing in a direction that could cause a flicker effect
4967722 it feels like david and goliath up against yorkshire water
4967723 i dont know of any other proposal where families will be living so close within 300 metres france works on a minimum of 1 5 km
4967724 we had absolutely no idea at all about wind turbines that was the general mood
4967725 we can hear the mechanical noise but we have tolerated them but we are not prepared to tolerate something three times the height and eight times their power
4967726 to live only 318 metres away from a 125 metre turbine in a quiet rural setting is frightening for us the machines will completely and utterly dominate the landscape and the noise emitted will be overbearing in our quiet location
4967727 everyone who has come to look asks about the new turbines i am unable to say anything we expected to sell quite quickly because this kind of property is not affected by the bad market at the moment
4967728 we appreciate that the proposal by yorkshire water to replace the current four turbines with two large ones is extremely emotive the estate is one of the many interested parties and we must rely on the democratic process to take its course so that the arguments for and against are properly heard
4967729 i remember the 70s waiting in line for gas what have we done since then shame on us
4967730 its unconscionable for the state bureaucracy to be blocking approvals when families and businesses are suffering daily from outrageous energy costs
4967731 it seems as though theres too much wind in the newark offices of the bpu and not enough determination to get offshore windmills tested promptly
4967732 if you dont take the first step youre not going to get there
4967733 this is the first time we are considering offshore wind
4967734 it is one of the first times in the united states its been considered its something you want to do right
4967735 the green communities act broadly restructured the role and mandate of our energy agencies to accelerate the growth of renewable power and energy efficiency and governor patrick has set a high bar for us to make good on the promise of making massachusetts a national leader in clean energy
4967736 represents an important source of financing for the development of renewable energy in massachusetts and the governors appointment of these highly qualified individuals will help to give direction to the newly restructured trust to deliver a major expansion of green power in the years ahead

4967740 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4967741 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4967742 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4967743 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4967744 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4967745 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4967746 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4967747 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4967748 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4967749 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4967750 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4967751 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4967752 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4967753 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4967754 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4967755 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4967756 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4967757 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4967758 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4967759 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4967760 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4967761 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4967762 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4967763 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4967764 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4967765 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4967766 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4967767 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4967768 die business angels szene in deutschland ist noch deutlich unterentwickelt
4967769 we cannot stand idly by and wait for market forces or the electricity good fairy to solve this problem for us
4967770 we already saw what happened when we tried to whistle a happy song 70 percent rate hikes
4967771 we need to harness clean energy in a way that we can tell people theres an economic benefit
4967772 the range we have given is really around making sure we have some flexibility we need to keep some competition around the procurement of the turbines
4967773 until we got that certainly we couldnt get down to the detail
4967774 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
4967775 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
4967776 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
4967777 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
4967778 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4967779 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4967780 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
4967781 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
4967782 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
4967783 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
4967784 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4967785 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4967786 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4967787 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4967788 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4967789 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4967790 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4967791 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4967792 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4967793 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4967794 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4967795 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4967796 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4967797 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4967798 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4967799 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4967800 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4967801 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4967802 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4967803 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4967804 we are a world leader in installed capacity in wind energy
4967805 the big difference with wind energy is the land can still be used as it was before the turbines were installed
4967806 there will be a pole with the turbine on top possibly a small maintenance and equipment shed and some type of access to the turbine but the land will be put back the way it was before we got there a lot of times you see the cows and livestock standing right next to the windmill grazing
4967807 it cant be a checkerboard it has to be a solid block of land we must have a large area of land owners who are on board with the project
4967808 most of the people weve talked to are open to it people really grasp that wind energy is good for the environment its a truly clean and environmentally friendly way to produce energy with no emissions
4967809 you will know the price you will be paying for the life of the project
4967810 if the wind stops blowing your lights are not going to go out
4967811 its reliable and dependable because the wind is constantly moving the more sites we have with turbines the more dependable it becomes
4967812 as we were riding up there were kids standing out there by the checkpoint waving at the marines
4967813 you would never have seen that back in 2004 and 2005 and even part of 2006 those kids would have turned their heads back then because of the job you all have done out here that is possible today
4967814 he came out here to check up on our well being
4967815 you know it means a lot that hes out here
4967816 most of the stuff that he talked about answered questions that marines had going into the meeting it took a lot of stuff off peoples minds which is important especially out here he really drilled home the fact that the marine corps isnt pulling out of iraq anytime soon
4967817 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4967818 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4967819 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4967820 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4967821 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4967822 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4967823 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4967824 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4967825 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4967826 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4967827 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4967828 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4967829 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4967830 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
4967831 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
4967832 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
4967833 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
4967834 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4967835 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4967836 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4967837 when i find myself taking the wrong step i think a lot of the time its because im trying to protect myself instead of trying to do gods work
4967838 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4967839 with republicans we usually think of them as comfortable in an evangelical setting
4967840 its big news that a democrat will be in that setting and obamas much more comfortable in that world
4967841 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
4967842 its a chance for mccain to reinforce that hes with the evangelical community on most issues
4967843 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4967844 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4967845 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4967846 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4967847 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4967848 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4967849 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4967850 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4967851 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4967852 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4967853 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4967854 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4967855 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4967856 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4967857 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4967858 das war ein guter start der lust auf mehr macht
4967859 der sieg war vielleicht etwas gl cklich aber trotzdem verdient
4967860 es ist ein sch nes gef hl das erste spiel in leverkusen zu gewinnen es war nicht einfach und am ende vielleicht auch ein bisschen gl cklich
4967861 nat rlich haben die leverkusener bei einem spielstand von 1 3 nichts mehr zu verlieren sie haben dann auch lange b lle gespielt und alles nach vorne geworfen so kommt automatisch die eine oder andere situation zustande in der man nicht mehr die ruhe hat um sein spiel fortsetzen zu k nnen am ende war der sieg vielleicht etwas gl cklich aber trotzdem verdient
4967862 richtig das war gegen leverkusen ein guter start der lust auf mehr macht jetzt wollen wir mal schauen was n chste woche gegen bayern passiert
4967863 ja das ist ziemlich bitter gerade wenn dede so lange ausfallen m sste deswegen sind wir alle auch ein bisschen bedr ckt ich konnte es gar nicht glauben als ich in die kabine gekommen bin
4967864 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4967865 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4967866 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4967867 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4967868 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4967869 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4967870 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4967871 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4967872 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4967873 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4967874 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4967875 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love

4967878 sai che le particelle subatomiche non obbediscono alle leggi della fisica
4967879 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo
4967880 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
4967881 dan janganlah kamu campur adukan kebenaran dengan kebatilan dan janganlah kamu sembunyikan kebenaran sedangkan kamu mengetahuinya
4967882 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4967883 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4967884 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4967885 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4967886 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4967887 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4967888 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4967889 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4967890 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4967891 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4967892 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4967893 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4967894 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4967895 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4967896 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4967897 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4967898 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4967899 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4967900 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4967901 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4967902 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4967903 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4967904 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4967905 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4967906 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4967907 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4967908 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4967909 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4967910 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4967911 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4967912 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4967913 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4967914 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4967915 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4967916 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4967917 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4967918 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4967919 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4967920 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4967921 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4967922 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4967923 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4967924 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4967925 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4967926 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4967927 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4967928 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4967929 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4967930 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

4967948 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12

4967951 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4967952 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4967953 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

4967956 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4967957 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4967958 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4967959 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4967960 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4967961 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action

4967967 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

4967973 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4967974 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4967975 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4967976 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4967977 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4967978 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4967979 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4967980 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4967981 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4967982 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4967983 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4967984 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4967985 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away

4967987 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4967988 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4968002 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4968003 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4968004 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4968005 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it

4968007 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4968008 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4968009 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4968010 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4968011 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4968012 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4968013 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4968014 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives

4968029 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4968030 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4968031 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4968032 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4968033 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4968034 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4968035 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4968036 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4968037 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4968038 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4968039 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4968040 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4968041 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4968042 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4968043 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4968044 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4968045 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4968046 who are open to doing something on the production side
4968047 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4968048 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4968049 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4968050 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4968051 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4968052 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4968053 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4968054 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4968074 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4968075 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4968076 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4968077 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4968078 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4968079 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4968080 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4968081 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4968082 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4968083 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4968084 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4968085 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4968086 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4968087 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4968088 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4968089 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4968090 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4968091 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4968092 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4968093 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4968094 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4968095 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4968096 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4968097 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4968098 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4968099 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4968100 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4968101 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4968102 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4968103 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4968104 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4968105 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4968106 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4968107 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4968108 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4968109 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4968110 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4968111 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4968112 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4968113 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4968114 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4968115 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4968116 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4968117 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4968118 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4968119 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4968120 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4968121 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4968122 why not i want to purchase arms for this struggle and you refuse to issue a fatwa for it the entire ummah and religion will be exposed to loss
4968123 because you came to us as a slave who owned nothing and i see that you now own gardens servants slave girls silver and gold so if you sell all of these things and still need money after that i will issue the

4968128 orang tidak boleh menggunakan masalah peribadi untuk berkempen tetapi kena lawan dasar antara pas dan umno
4968129 yang bawa cerita sumpah pada hari penamaan calon apa dia tidak ada cara lain lagi untuk berkempen
4968130 sumpah seperti itu letak kitab atas tangan adalah meniru amalan orang kristian ini karut
4968131 saya nak jumpa supaya umno tidak terus menerima islam separuh sahaja kerana jika umno tidak ada islam menjadi lebih baik di bawah pas

4968133 kalau kita sayang umno kita tarik orang melayu yang muda muda dalam umno supaya masuk pas tetapi orang tua orang kaya dan menteri biarlah di situ
4968134 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4968135 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4968136 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4968137 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4968138 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4968139 we are planning to first implement a pilot project in a couple of locations first
4968140 tentatively we have chosen bangalore and chandigarh for the pilot project
4968141 you should have seen the mood of the people in pampore during saturdays massive rally to pay tributes to slain hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz you should have seen the attitude of the people at baramulla when one of our senior most leaders shabir ahmad shah who led the muzaffarabad chalao march tried to control and pacify the marchers
4968142 please try and understand that the people are now in no mood to give up their right to self determination
4968143 but we are against violence of any kind we condemn violence against anybody and everybody
4968144 you should have seen the mood of the people in pampore during saturdays massive rally to pay tributes to slain hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz you should have seen the attitude of the people at baramulla when one of our senior most leaders shabir ahmad shah who led the muzaffarabad chalao march tried to control and pacify the marchers
4968145 our people have died in dozens during the last six days hundreds have been injured what do we tell the people do we tell them go home and lick their wounds
4968146 no that is not possible now delhi spoke of normalcy tourism development bridges roads and tulip gardens now when all that has been proved to be a mirage you are looking at us to cool down
4968147 the present movement would only be contained if the government of india without wasting any further time opens up the srinagar muzaffarabad trade route repeals the draconian special powers act giving sweeping powers to its security forces and also begins the gradual withdrawal of its troops from the hinterland
4968148 that to me appears the only possible means to cool down the tempers at the moment
4968149 do you think the youth who are highly surcharged at the moment are not educated enough to understand the economic fallout of what they are doing
4968150 the masses fully understand what they are doing and how volatile the situation is but having said that it is the responsibility of the indian government to understand that after 18 long years the propaganda that the situation has returned to normalcy has not helped anyone of us
4968151 that is what we have been asking india and pakistan to determine hold a referendum and you would know the results
4968152 that should be the worry of the people why are you worried on that count it is our problem how kashmir survives economically after independence or after merger with pakistan
4968153 allow us to determine our political future and then we will address our economic worries
4968154 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4968155 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4968156 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4968157 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4968158 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4968159 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4968160 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4968161 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4968162 he has now made two of the biggest divorce payments in showbiz history
4968163 at least no one can accuse him of leaving his ex wives short
4968164 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4968165 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4968166 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4968167 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4968168 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4968169 filling your car eating out staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe even without taking house prices into account
4968170 if the uk continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals

4968251 i have prepared government budgets and know how they are padded at the federal level those monies had to be used up by the end of the year and there was always money left over if that takes place at the federal level i am sure it does on the county level id like to think that perhaps i can help see those extra funds find their way into projects that need funding in the county

4968267 i dont know enough about it the amendment to know whether it is a good or bad thing
4968268 but i do know that people were very concerned that it would take away funding for schools and without a tradeoff there was going to be an issue as to where the money was going to come from
4968269 i think we need to be more careful what we put on the ballot and what everyone votes on especially when governments now are struggling with what they have to pay for
4968270 we should be more careful and study things more carefully about the ballot we would rather be careful of up front of what we implement rather than try to fix the problems we have made for ourselves
4968271 in fact i was at a meeting there this morning thursday in lakeland and the association has pledged in excess of 1 million to promote the passage of this amendment
4968272 now keep in mind this is the same group of realtors who supported the passage of amendment 1 that now has florida counties searching for money to pay bills
4968273 now with the judges interpretation of how that amendment is worded for the ballot i was under the impression that the legislature would have to replace the lost taxes for schools
4968274 but the way it reads they are only obligated to do this for the first year so i am now 100 percent against it
4968275 felt it was a more equitable tax than just a property tax
4968276 from my standpoint i was disappointed it was taken off the ballot
4968277 however it may give us a chance to educate the public on our stance on that particular issue
4968278 we heard today in lakeland from lobbyists from the far and how the realtor organization is very much behind amendment 5
4968279 they had not heard this judicial review of the amendment was going to happen they were going to remove the school tax from the property tax and put that burden back on the state to find another way to raise the taxes
4968280 right now people who are renting are not paying taxes yet their children are attending the schools
4968281 i think it is a better way to be fair to pay taxes with sales taxes according to far if the cost of your taxes is lower than more people can afford to buy a home and help realtors to make a living this should help to stir up the business as an individual i feel it is not a fair tax the way its done now
4968282 the winter haven chamber board discussed the potential for that amendment 5 at its summer retreat and the general consensus was that it was a really bad amendment
4968283 i think the biggest problem is it would not address the funding for our schools you only have to look at the university and schools scores to realize that we are not doing something right as far as funding goes

4968308 libraries increasingly see digitization as a preservation strategy while microsofts departure probably wont cause significant upheaval it will reinforce for universities the necessity of ensuring that they retain the rights to their scanned materials or that their digitization projects will be around next semester let alone forever one way to do that is to continue pursuing internal proprietary scanning projects which for many libraries existed for years before google and microsoft made it possible to vastly increase their scope and scale another is to work with nonprofit initiatives but if theres one thing libraries agree on its that the competition between the two companies was healthy

4968342 if i could have my pick i would like to learn that newtons laws must be modified in order to correctly describe gravitational interactions at large distances

4968348 this could be a reason for four neutrons hitting the ganil detectors simultaneously

4968390 weve been in conversation for a number of months with the dep to see if they would consider to having the water body annexed into the towns municipal limits

4968426 he helped people who couldnt help themselves he helped the lame helped the blind helped feed those who couldnt feed themselves
4968427 but jesus was full of grace and truth and we have to try to discern when should grace be applied and when truth is the better medicine

4968524 its a problem in not only urban areas but in low income rural areas as well
4968525 they simply dont understand how schools work or what is expected of them if parents are paying attention they will get their kids to school on time
4968526 school begins monday august 18 2008 7 20 7 20 be there be on time be ready
4968527 a lot of kids in urban communities like to work longer during the summer so they can bring in money for their families
4968528 at a minimum kids like to look good on the first day of school perhaps more than any other time
4968529 often the situation is not more complicated than a case of parents and students not knowing when the first day of school is
4968530 and that situation is exacerbated in neighborhoods with high immigration populations they know when school is supposed to start but not necessarily which day
4968531 to have kids stream in one at a time makes the teachers jobs that much more difficult
4968532 its lost learning time for kids who can ill afford it

4968544 contamination remains that could pose a potential risk to future residents on the tract
4968545 we were excluded and arent really sure of the reason for that
4968546 we never had any indication there was any disposal by bliss or his employees on byrnes property
4968547 a major client of theirs had expressed some reservations about their participation in this project
4968548 it could be that a third party had taken the material and disposed of it without any liability from monsanto
4968549 it could spur more investigations for pcbs at other dioxin sites in missouri as many other sites were only tested for dioxin

4968592 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington

4968617 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4968618 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4968619 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4968620 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4968621 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
4968622 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
4968623 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
4968624 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
4968625 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
4968626 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
4968627 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4968628 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
4968629 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
4968630 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning

4968632 but if you dont have that there is something wrong with you

4968640 it took us a half an hour just to get a cab
4968641 then we took a subway to tiananmen square and the forbidden city some dignitary was being shown through and we commoners kept getting yelled at and forced off the main path
4968642 a local got very angry about it and we almost got caught in the middle of a fistfight between him and the security
4968643 but the crowd was huge and the dancers pulled off a great performance
4968644 i dont think they envisioned their works with a huge coke bottle in the middle of the stage
4968645 the big boss here at coke came to me immediately after the performance and said they do lots of events here and would love to have us do more stuff for them
4968646 the dancers of odt meet this challenge and then surpass it the company is sure to impress wherever they go and will awe their toughest critic
4968647 there were a few roadblocks that we had to overcome

4968680 oleh karena ucapan ulama meski tinggi derajat dan kedudukannya bisa diterima dan bisa ditolak serta kemungkinan bisa salah bisa benar maka saya ingin menulis sebuah dialog ilmiah yang ringkas untuk menjawab fatwa lajnah yang terhormat
4968681 wajib bagi orang yang masih mengasihi dirinya apabila membaca kitab kitab para ulama dan melihat isinya serta mengetahui ucapan mereka agar dia menimbangnya dengan dan sunnah
4968682 ini adalah suatu kesalahan dari lajnah dan aku merasa terganggu dengan adanya fatwa ini fatwa ini telah memecah belah kaum muslimin di seluruh negeri sampai sampai mereka menghubungiku baik dari amerika maupun eropa tidak ada yang dapat mengambil manfaat dari fatwa ini melainkan takfiriyun tukang mengka firkan dan tsauriyun para pemberon tak
4968683 saya tidak suka keluarnya fatwa ini karena membuat bingung manusia
4968684 fadhilatusy syaikh jazakumullahu khoiron apa pendapat anda tentang fatwa yang dikeluarkan oleh lajnah da imah seputar dua kitab syaikh ali bin hasan hafidzahullahu
4968685 saudara kholid bin ali al anbari telah menghadiahkan kepadaku kitab karangannya
4968686 aku mendapatkan kitab syaikh kholid bin ali bin muhammad al anbari yang berjudul
4968687 tidak tersembunyi lagi bagi anda sekalian bahwa mewajibkan mengharamkan hanyalah hak alloh dan rasul nya seba gaimana yang telah dikatakan oleh syaikhul islam ibnu taimiyah rahimahullahu
4968688 dan peliharalah dirimu dari adzab yang terjadi pada hari yang pada waktu itu kamu semua dikembalikan kepada alloh kemudian masing masing diri diberi balasan yang sempurna terhadap apa yang telah dikerjakannya sedang mereka sedikitpun tidak dianiaya dirugikan
4968689 menceritakan kepadaku orang yang terpercaya bahwa para takfiriyun mencoba untuk membujuk syaikh bin baz agar mencekal kitab ini dan mereka berusaha untuk menjelek jelekkannya akan tetapi syaikh membantah mereka hingga mereka pun gagal akan tetapi sepeninggal syaikh mereka berhasil menjalankan makarnya
4968690 now what are you going to do with the information
4968691 o allah i seek refuge with you from the punishment of the grave and from the afflictions of the anti christ and from the afflictions of life and death
4968692 and since the claim to lordship of the anti christ is impossible in and of itself and none of the miracles that he will perform will be sufficient proof of his truthfulness rather it will be a test and a trial with which allah misguides whom he wills and guides whom he wills such as the test of the golden calf with the children of israel it will nevertheless be the greatest trial and the implications of this trial is not limited to those who are present to witness him personally rather the reality of his trial is the falsehood that is at odds with the divine law shariah backed up by apparent miracles so whoever goes along with that which is in opposition to the shariah because of his amazement at some supposed miracle then he has been afflicted by this trial and this is widespread in every era and every place the trial of the anti christ in particular is the severest of trials so if allah protects his servant from it whether he witnesses it personally or not then he will be protected from what is less than it of trials fitan
4968693 and the reference to the trial of the anti christ is simply a reference to a

4968731 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4968732 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4968733 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4968734 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4968783 das unterschiedliche k rperliche niveau der spieler hing auch damit zusammen dass wir im vergleich zur wm 2006 eine woche weniger vorbereitung hatten diese woche aber h tten wir gut gebrauchen k nnen wir m ssen jetzt mit der liga besprechen wie wir das im hinblick auf s dafrika verbessern k nnen
4968784 ob wir nicht wieder den einen oder anderen leistungstest einschieben k nnen die haben wir im vergangenen jahr aus zeitmangel gar nicht mehr durchgef hrt
4968785 ich wei dass das schwierig ist bei dem engen terminkalender der klubs aber wir m ssen dort den hebel ansetzen
4968786 alle spieler auf ein niveau zu bringen wir m ssen deshalb die k rperliche basis der spieler berdenken und ganz sicher auch verbessern
4968787 wir brauchen mehrere spieler die ein finale aufgrund ihrer klasse auch mal alleine entscheiden k nnen das ist eine frage der individuellen st rke und nicht immer eine frage der spielphilosophie oder des trainings

4968791 one must first remove the fallen trees then tidy up the house and cellar and in the third phase bring the shine back to the house

4968796 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
4968797 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
4968798 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4968799 i cant stand the little bastard i couldnt wish it on a nicer man if he wins it he can go into well deserved obscurity in the house of commons if he loses fine
4968800 it cant possibly be henry if we had to put henry up it would be a wider sign that the labour party was in deep deep trouble if we cant find a youngish candidate it just shows that the cupboard is bare and we cant afford that
4968801 compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody elses skin it is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too
4968802 if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion
4968803 it is lack of love for ourselves that inhibits our compassion toward others if we make friends with ourselves then there is no obstacle to opening our hearts and minds to others
4968804 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4968805 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4968806 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4968807 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4968808 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4968809 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4968810 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4968811 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4968812 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4968813 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4968814 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4968815 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4968816 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4968817 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4968818 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4968819 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4968820 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4968821 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4968822 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4968823 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4968824 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4968825 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4968826 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4968827 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4968828 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4968829 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4968830 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4968831 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4968832 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4968833 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4968834 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4968835 this is a planning took where all things are going
4968836 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4968837 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4968838 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4968839 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4968840 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4968841 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4968842 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4968843 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4968844 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4968845 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4968846 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4968847 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4968848 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4968849 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4968850 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4968851 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4968852 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4968853 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4968854 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4968855 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4968856 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4968857 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4968858 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4968859 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4968860 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4968861 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4968862 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4968863 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4968864 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4968865 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4968866 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4968867 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4968868 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4968869 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4968870 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4968871 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4968872 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4968873 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4968874 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4968875 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4968876 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4968877 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4968878 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4968879 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4968880 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4968881 ms binah chair of the california democratic party envior caucus also touched on wave energy and the disastrous repercussions it could have on our oceans
4968882 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon
4968883 our goal is to offer the best customer service and the widest range of pop culture items on ebay at down to earth prices
4968884 all bread will go stale much faster when stored in the fridge we would recommend that bread is stored in a cool dry place such as a bread bin
4968885 i have never seen that logo that fin wouldnt be original or they wouldnt have done that
4968886 as spring arrives thoughts always turn to color and expression young girls feel more comfortable with themselves if they are able to express themselves and dress according to their mood our spring 2007 collection introduces many unique looks incorporating a playful use of embellishments ruffles and cute girly details that will definitely add a little sunshine to any little girls day
4968887 we would appreciate any efforts on the part of the chinese government to put pressure on the dprk north korea to come forward on this issue
4968888 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4968889 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4968890 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4968891 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4968892 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4968893 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4968894 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4968895 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4968896 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4968897 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4968898 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4968899 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4968900 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4968901 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4968902 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4968903 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4968904 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4968905 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4968906 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4968907 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4968908 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4968909 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4968910 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4968911 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4968912 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4968913 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4968914 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4968915 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4968916 het herstelprogramma heeft niet het gewenste effect opgeleverd hij is zondag weer in looppass gegaan maar blijft pijn houden

4968920 the sounds of silence is the song that propelled the 1960s folk music duo simon and garfunkel to popularity

4968923 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
4968924 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently

4968948 so good has the lowdown on anything thats happening in the world of food media hes the guy who broke the lebron james papa johns scandal and the hilarious kraft cheese myspace debacle
4968949 fortune 500 corporations spend millions on r amp d for food products and marketing strategy eick picks them apart in a dc minute
4968950 i really like so good because it generally focuses on the more humorous food related news
4968951 always enjoyable if you havent read it yet do so immediately
4968952 like a bus full of carnies it scares the crap out of me to look at it but i stare anyway
4968953 a sandwich is just a sandwich but eick talking about a sandwich is epic poetry
4968954 jon eick has the rare gift of being diabolically funny without putting others down
4968955 a new blog from funny as hell stand up comedian jon eick
4968956 later dont know the car will stall or not leh
4968957 today you are not going to drive first you will learn amp understand the driving usage inside car blablabla
4968958 everything was pretty much agreed and then i said look gentlemen before we do this can you tell me how youre going to run this club
4968959 im sitting there with all the legal documents in front of me and they outline their plans
4968960 well carve this up and well sell that off and after a while i said enough were not doing the deal
4968961 we got up and walked out we took our papers and went out of the door it wasnt for rangers
4968962 andrei would love to go to england but if it stays like this there will be no deal
4968963 zenit will not sell for a penny less than 25million euros 19 7million and tottenham will not go above 22million 17 3million
4968964 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
4968965 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
4968966 you feel terry will give 100 whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
4968967 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 in his game by being captain
4968968 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays
4968969 he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
4968970 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
4968971 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia
4968972 this time lets not be intimidated by the opposition and play two strikers
4968973 for that to work in qualification it has to be tried against the czechs
4968974 if wayne rooney is still not 100 because of his virus maybe peter crouch and jermain defoe should be given a chance as club mates at portsmouth
4968975 i dont know what the situation is with rooney but id like to see him at the england team hotel for some of the time even if he isnt needed to play
4968976 obviously deans got to be picked for england yet but if he is and hes pain free in the morning he will be available to play
4968977 weve just got to hope its only cramp with craig bellamy and kieron dyer still out its the last thing we need from our point of view to see deano out as well
4968978 he has done ever so well and is in a real run of goals scoring six in five pre season friendlies after his late burst last season
4968979 hes leaner too hes worked hard and has been on a different diet it would be a real shame if hes got another injury now but i think hell be all right
4968980 frustration is an understatement we were terrible for 15 minutes but everything we did after that was a delight
4968981 arguably we should have got something out of it palacios was superb the kid has got everything you want in a footballer and if he keeps playing like this hell be a fantastic one
4968982 it was arsene who recommended him i was trying to sign mathieu flamini for birmingham at the time and couldnt get him but wenger said ive got this lad from honduras on trial and hes worth a look
4968983 he came to birmingham did well and i signed him again for wigan in january
4968984 hes been great and it would take a lot of money to prise him off us now luckily there are only two weeks to go to the transfer deadline
4968985 he was just like the player i saw when i went over to egypt hustling and bustling around
4968986 i wondered whether he could reproduce that in the premier league and it looks like he can
4968987 if he keeps his feet on the ground and adds a little bit of composure to his game then hell do really well for us
4968988 but were frustrated today because of those first 15 minutes when we were dreadful
4968989 there was no way we could have expected to come back and win here after giving them two goals so dearly but we nearly did
4968990 well take the win i thought we were very good in the first half and should have had more goals but their midfield overran us in the second
4968991 we let things slip but at least our defending was very good and weve still got players to come back

4968998 i had written this before at the time of partition when suharawady surrendered only due to political pressure but only suharawady not his followers they went on with the massacre gandhi started his fast
4968999 take his blood to your mahatma tell him if he goes on fast again he can finish it by drinking not orange juice but my sons blood
4969000 i am going to assassinate him in the open before the public because i am going to do it as my duty
4969001 no one should think that gandhi was killed by a madman
4969002 gandhi used to claim the partition would be over his dead body so after partition when he didnt die i killed him

4969021 uit een studie in science uit 2005 blijkt dat uitvloeiingsgesteenten als basalt die hun oorsprong in de aardmantel vinden minder zeldzame aardmetalen bevatten als neodymium en ook minder uranium dan meteorieten die we op aarde vinden omdat geologen ervan uitgaan dat de aarde en meteorieten net als de rest van ons zonnestelsel uit hetzelfde materiaal bestaan moet de rest ergens in een aards reservoir verborgen zitten

4969052 unfortunately it seems that the maltese and gozitan electoral offices are not being pro active in enrolling non maltese eu residents in the electoral register for the european parliament elections for example comparative scrutiny of the respective october electoral registers reveal that in the locality of st pauls bay whereas 2 909 non maltese eu citizens are enrolled in the local council register only 113 are likewise enrolled in the european parliament one
4969053 unfortunately no date has been set for the renewal of i d cards and this is not expected to be started before sometime in 2009
4969054 given that the deadline for enrolment in the european parliament electoral register to be eligible to vote in the european parliament elections next year is late february early march the electoral commission should immediately send a letter to every single resident non maltese eu citizen already enrolled on the local council electoral registers and on its i d card holder data base informing them of their eu voting rights and of how to enroll on the european parliament electoral register

4969061 i think i can do it because ive been training with her i told chiharu the gold medal is for her too
4969062 if icho is to go for a third gold it may be up to her sister too kaori icho said if her 26 year old sister wants to work toward london in 2012 she will too
4969063 im not sure if i want to compete by myself if chiharu will go i should say i will go
4969064 this isnt what i came here for but ill take it and work hard to get back
4969065 i felt better in that match there were a couple of times where i stopped wrestling and i paid for it i paid for it with two points i know myself and i know i can wrestle better
4969066 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect
4969067 everyones buzzing they the players dont think we can get beat by anyone
4969068 we are really provoked and motivated to bring home that gold
4969069 we are not far from it two games more and hopefully we can do it
4969070 nigeria became the first african nation to win the olympic title in soccer in 1996 with a supremely talented squad headlined by the likes of jay jay okocha nwankwo kanu and taribo west
4969071 the 1996 olympics was such a big event for nigeria
4969072 i watched those games like 10 times even after the tournament i had recordings of them and used to play them often
4969073 i dont believe that actually myself i am so close to it if i get that medal i dont know how ill feel but definitely it is going to be a great feeling
4969074 theres hope from our country and other african countries hoping that we can go and make africa proud
4969075 even when we beat the ivory coast they were saying good luck to us hoping that we can go on and win this
4969076 it would be nice if an african team can win it but there are other teams in this tournament south americans as well so its going to be tough really tough
4969077 up first for nigeria is a resilient belgium side that rallied to beat italy 3 2 in the quarterfinals despite playing a man down for more than 70 minutes the nigerians watched much of that match on television before their own clash with ivory coast
4969078 weve worked really hard the past couple of years to qualify for this and to finally get here to finally get to the semifinal it would be really disappointing to go home with nothing

4969083 for years our economy has depended almost exclusively on tourism and gaming gambling rather than by exporting goods and services implicit in this tax strategy was a belief that the revenues from gaming and tourism could keep pace with our growing and diverse population unfortunately this strategy has failed my fellow nevadans the lesson from the last 20 years is clear our revenue system is broken because it has relied on regressive and unstable taxes from gambling

4969191 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4969192 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4969208 what happened to me is what made me who i am today
4969209 since my mum died i have had to fend for myself sometimes you have to grow up quickly regardless of whether you like it or not its just forced upon you
4969210 i guess im lucky i know my parents are still watching me with pride
4969211 giant and bigfoot were the names they used to call me and that was hard
4969212 you have your moments when you try to be strong about it but inside it hurt it stung quite deeply
4969213 it was difficult because my older sister was pregnant and my younger sister was eight so it was left to me the person in the middle the one with the biggest arms you could find
4969214 we were watching the opening ceremony for the 2000 sydney games and i remember thinking one day i want to be part of that
4969215 even after the funeral i didnt go to training because i didnt know what i wanted it was just so hard to do
4969216 then in 2001 i thought no i owe it to my mum for giving me all that money to feed me to always sacrifice our familys financial situation just to get me to training i owed it to her to continue and go as hard as i could
4969217 i was a teenager back then and i finished eighth i am 23 now i have so much more experience under my belt
4969218 as soon as i stepped off the plane from japan i took off for the two hour journey by car
4969219 i was pretty lucky i got to see him again as he passed away shortly after i arrived
4969220 kirsten just said to me youve got nothing to lose here do this one for your dad show them what you got
4969221 yes im married and everything but my mother is still no 1 in my heart
4969222 my sisters and i have had to grow up really quickly
4969223 i could have chosen to be a total crack head or turned to smoking or drinking or whatever and just waste my life on doing something that wasnt really benefiting me in any way
4969224 so thank god i had done athletics and done sports before it happened because path was already set

4969232 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4969233 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4969234 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4969235 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4969236 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4969237 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4969238 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4969239 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4969240 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4969241 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4969242 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4969243 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4969285 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle age years and maybe put off something they thought they couldnt do because they thought theyre too old or thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent if what ive done shows them that they can go out and do it then im absolutely thrilled that would be a rewarding experience if that comes out of this

4969453 if i was alan curbishley i would be worried about that story because paul smith is just about the best connected journalist there is in portsmouth
4969454 it looks to me like theres definitely something in it so id say alan curtbishley hasnt got very long at the start of this season if they dont get off to a flyer
4969455 im not saying west ham should get rid of curbishley but harrys their favourite son hes done a magnificent job with portsmouth and he did a magnificent job with west ham beforehand
4969456 portsmouth from harrys point of view dont seem to want to spend any more money or dont have any money and for harry i think it would be a very attractive proposition to go back again
4969457 from curbishleys point of view he hasnt quite won over the west ham fans there was a little bit of disgruntlement among the supporters last season but then there often is at west ham
4969458 i just think theres no smoke without fire in this one harry redknapp seems to have been angling to get away from portsmouth over the summer and theres clearly a bit of unrest in the way harry feels at portsmouth
4969459 hes won the fa cup what more can he do with portsmouth
4969460 the moneys not there and you saw the players in the community shield last week any older and theyd be taking their pension book at the back they really were looking like an old team
4969461 hes lost sulley muntari one of his better players hes got in peter crouch and younes kaboul and theyre not going to be in the top five or six with those sorts of players
4969462 west ham do have the backing the icelandic money is still there and as shaun said he is still the favoured son
4969463 its another challenge and lets be fair harry loves the next move hes always interested in what comes next and hes never settled anywhere
4969464 he can commute from sandbanks to west ham because he used to when he was manager there before so its viable for him

4969476 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4969477 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4969478 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4969479 if our plans do not come to fruition it is hardly the end of the road
4969480 we want to concentrate on winning and the best news for our supporters is to win games
4969481 in the first half they were attacking the second half we were on top and attacking and continued until the end
4969482 we had chances torres is a key player and he can change games for the team its really important to have these sorts of players
4969483 we tired in the last 15 to 20 minutes which is something i should take responsibility for we should have had some tougher games in pre season
4969484 for all the hard work the number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes is huge and the other 75 minutes goes out of the window
4969485 on thursday he hurt his ankle in training it is not serious i think but he did not train the next day
4969486 overall deco is now in very good condition and gives a balance to the team which is important for us
4969487 he cannot make all the difference on his own but with the team he can because he always has time
4969488 he has time to shoot time to stop the ball and time to play a short or a long pass
4969489 his character is different and important to us because with him other players can grow
4969490 if he is fouled we have a referee to say so but his technical control is fantastic deco can play in any league in the world
4969491 he is my only signing at the moment when they signed a contract with me i told them i want one player deco
4969492 actually i would like one more player but i will not say his name i said if they wanted to change things they needed this player and they tried
4969493 kaka has a contract with milan for five years if you ask milan if they want to sell any players there is only one they would not sell and thats kaka
4969494 technically and i wont say their names two or three players impressed me
4969495 they were better than i thought they would be i changed my ideas about them
4969496 and off the field two or three players who i thought would maybe be not polite and i would have a problem with them proved they were different they had respect and i am satisfied with them
4969497 when you watch games from the outside there are some situations where it seems players arent showing any respect but when you start to work with them you get to know their character and personalities
4969498 its not an easy place to go to but we can take a lot of good things from the community shield last week manchester united then i think we can get a result
4969499 we can improve attacking wise from last week but we defended really well then and need to do that again
4969500 ive played with crouchie a few times and we have a natural understanding but a lot of the boys have not played with him before so it will take a while for others to get used to him
4969501 but everyone is working hard and it will pay off sooner rather than later
4969502 even in pre season its always important to be scoring goals as a striker
4969503 it helps to build confidence and i will be looking to take that into the season
4969504 its not a bottomless pit we cant expect the owner to keep funding it but its hard when you have to sell top players
4969505 a team like that can rip you to pieces if you are not careful and we have to find a way to stop them
4969506 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4969507 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4969508 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4969509 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4969510 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4969511 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful

4969829 would you write a baby love for children with disabilities
4969830 its like half of me is gone she was more than a friend she was my sister my mother all rolled into one
4969831 she looked after both of us she was actually more of a mother to bianca than i am
4969832 she used to hate those trucks and often cursed at them when they came speeding past
4969833 she was like my mother taking me shopping to the movies and to the spur
4969834 she would sit with me hug me and talk about school and stuff she used to like wearing boxers shorts and mitzi her cat slept with her he would lick her nose to wake her up in the morning
4969835 she was a real tomboy she loved to play pool and enjoyed drinking black label she used to joke that the last time she wore a dress was in school
4969836 she always looked after people first her dad later us i dont know what we are going to do without her

4969838 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4969839 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4969840 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4969841 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4969842 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4969843 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4969844 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4969845 the worries that existed dont persist any more on the factory floor
4969846 the first part of the problem was that there was wholesale fear mongering on the part of some service providers they said that the government was going to nationalise pensions or steal the money from pensions and provident funds
4969847 people are under such financial stress that they resigned so as to get their pension money and then went and got or tried to get a job somewhere else
4969848 oddly enough it is more in the boardrooms more among so called educated people that worries remain
4969849 to begin with there are still too many unknowns who will be the asset managers who will collect and monitor the government fund will it be the revenue service that would in itself be a problem because sars is the taxman will it be a defined contribution fund or will it be a pooled fund and if so who will be responsible for investing it and where will it be invested will it go into the public investment corporation
4969850 it is expected that for tbilisi only this number would reach 160 00 there are 21 refugee checkpoints in the georgian capital and the situation is very tense regarding the increasing number of refugees and of those killed during military actions despite this the bulgarians in georgia do not wish to leave there are no georgian refugees wishing to come to bulgaria either to the contrary georgian citizens are asking for visas to go on vacation on the bulgarian black sea coast there is a significant increase in the numbers of those wishing to travel to bulgaria for tourism as reported by the consular office at the bulgarian embassy something that clearly shows that there is no panic among the georgians
4969851 we were able to meet with the towns governor who has two members of the georgian parliament assigned to help him but there is no police force russian or georgian the arriving humanitarian help consistently reaches its recipients we were warned not to stay out during the night due to crime and theft the town square has two shell holes but the statue of stalin is there intact
4969852 on that ground i would prefer it to be a mile as its going to be pretty testing
4969853 hell get a mile and a quarter but it will be more like a mile and a half so we are jumping up stamina wise and guessing a bit
4969854 the trainer thinks hell run up to his guineas form which means well give the derby winner a run to the line and david is never one to go down without a fight
4969855 its his first run since ascot and hes working well he did a bit of work the other day and came through it fine it wasnt a serious gallop but he did it well
4969856 were really excited and honoured that well be staging such a quality race and were grateful to connections for deciding to come to york

4969858 it is a payback from us to the army benevolent fund the care and after care of soldiers is paramount
4969859 filling your car eating out staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe even without taking house prices into account

4969861 he has now made two of the biggest divorce payments in showbiz history

4969864 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4969865 the instability is of course causing concerns in pakistan but it is also not in the interest of pakistans western allies
4969866 by today or tomorrow as there is no room for any delay
4969867 the reason we do that is to be able to cooperate with local authorities it also frees up the roads and just gets us prepared for a storm as it comes
