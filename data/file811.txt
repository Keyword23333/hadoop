8110020 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8110021 i wish to report that andrew jaspan will no longer be editor in chief
8110022 i will come and bid my adieu on the floor at 12noon
8110023 there will be reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial to ensure optimal employment of staff and technology and including outsourcing of elements that will not impact our quality position
8110024 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant

8110028 events like distance they can be a little boring so they cut between that and other events people who dont even know about track have been watching
8110029 every morning i wake up and its basketball on tv

8110031 when people start breaking world records everyones head is turned
8110032 even though i watched at least three world records at these olympics
8110033 because pole vault did not get the attention it deserved they showed the entire 200 and pole vault got maybe four minutes on each side mens and womens

8110036 racial and religious slur that is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8110037 a sturdy complex character drama thats 100 deserving of respect
8110038 its obviously one of the most original daring films about adolescent sexuality ever delivered by a quasi mainstreamer its also a sharp look at racism and not just the american bred kind and a sobering portrait of the rifts and tensions between american and middle eastern mindsets
8110039 and all of this out of a fairly simple period drama set in a houston suburb around the time of the gulf war about a 13 year old half lebanese half irish girl named jasira
8110040 is not exploitation not even a little bit its a smartly written thing with all kinds of intrigues and counterweights built into each character and an earnest residue of humanity seeping through at the finish
8110041 even eckharts character scumbag that he is has tics and shadings that make him more than just a thoughtless statutory rapist even jasiras dad a dictatorial racist thug of the first order comes off as somewhat sympathetic at times and each one is his own way cares for jasira and despite the dark sexual currents and as odd as this sound its also a fairly amusing film really its really boils down to being a neighborhood folks and their quirks movie that okay is a little bit icky in two or three scenes but isnt nearly as icky in a general sense as you might expect
8110042 the more videos they watched the fewer words they knew
8110043 these babies scored about 10 lower on language skills than infants who had not watched these videos

8110046 seru juga kali ya berciuman sambil nunggu cucian di tempat laundry seperti yang dilakukan ross dan rachel dalam friends
8110047 ih seru gimana itu mah bukan budaya kita kayak enggak ada tempat lain aja
8110048 tapi bahwa hasrat itu bisa muncul kapan saja sekali lagi itu bagian dari insting manusia yang wajar dan alamiah sekali
8110049 kalau menurut saya hasrat seksual adalah hak tiap individu harusnya bukan dilarang dengan undang undang justru batasan moral yang harus lebih diefektifkan
8110050 di tengah budaya masyarakat yang makin permisif public display of affection atau mengumbar kemesraan di tempat umum sepertinya semakin longgar
8110051 orang orang dengan kepribadian ekstrovert atau terbuka akan lebih mudah menerima dan melakukannya
8110052 lo memang kenapa kalau saya melakukannya toh saya tidak mengganggu orang lain
8110053 ini yang membuat masyarakat jadi ambigu di satu pihak mereka bisa menerima hal ini sebagai sebuah pemahaman tapi untuk diri sendiri masih cenderung konservatif
8110054 kalau setuju ya silakan jalan tapi kalau tidak ya jangan lakukan yang penting tidak mengganggu orang lain
8110055 jangan sampai satu pihak merasa puas tapi pihak lain malah tertekan ini juga tidak sehat untuk kelangsungan kehidupan seksual keduanya
8110056 kalau di sini sih orang biasanya masih malu dilihatin seperti itu

8110064 tak bisa dipastikan yang perlu dilihat justru kualitas hubungan suami istri yang bersangkutan
8110065 itu yang lebih bicara dibanding kehadiran musik saat mereka tengah berintim intim
8110066 obrolan enggak akan nyambung jika di saat yang sama mendengar suara musik keras mengentak entak kan bahkan musik klasik sekalipun kalau disetel keras keras ya jadi saling enggak dengar
8110067 bisa semiklasik piano solo jazz juga musik romantik jadi tak selalu harus musik klasik
8110068 kita kan sedang melakukan hubungan komunikasi kalau di saat seperti itu kita dengar musik yang bersyair maka ada dua jalur verbal yang ditangkap sekaligus oleh fungsi kognitif seseorang pertama ia menangkap stimulus indrawi melalui sensoris pendengaran auditorial sensory yang kemudian diteruskannya ke dalam sistem susunan saraf pusat nah masukan inilah yang diolah kembali antara lain menggunakan sistem yang dikenal sebagai funelling atau corong kalau butir pertama belum masuk maka butiran pasir berikut belum bisa masuk ke corong karena harus antre begitu seterusnya
8110069 ribet kan karena akan beradu antara syair lagu dan omongannya
8110070 keakraban terutama kedekatan psikis tidak ditentukan oleh musik semata melainkan oleh banyak hal terutama kondisi psikologi yang bersangkutan dalam memberi makna terhadap kehadiran suami istrinya
8110071 sepanjang musik yang diperdengarkan tadi bisa dinikmati oleh pasangan suami istri yang tengah berintim intim membuat keduanya dalam suasana relaks mengapa tidak
8110072 kalau suami istri lagi marahan biarpun disetel lagu seromantis apa pun saya sangsi gairah seksual bisa muncul
8110073 kalaupun ada yang bilang pengaruh musik terhadap seks sedemikian hebat mungkin penelitiannya terlalu bias artinya sudah ada harapan yang berlebihan mengenai hal tersebut
8110074 karena awalnya kan musik muncul sebagai pemujaan terhadap alam semesta dan penciptanya
8110075 pada dasarnya musik menghasilkan vibrasi suara nah itulahyang menggetarkan banyak elemen di dalam tubuh yang kemudian membangkitkan gairah tertentu di antaranya ya gairah erotis itu tadi hanya saja sifatnya sangat individual
8110076 boleh jadi libido mereka yang nongkrong di situ memang sudah tinggi lalu semakin dipacu lagi dengan suasana remang remang dan minuman beralkohol tinggi jadi bukan semata mata karena musiknya
8110077 i n the 21st century we need new and better stories new concepts and new vocabularies and grammar based not on the past but on the dangerous exciting and unexplored present with the understanding that each is at best a provisional reading of reality a single phenomenological profile that one day is likely to be revised if not completely overturned

8110089 saya tidak terlalu peduli dia cantik atau tidak asalkan wajahnya terkesan ramah saya pasti interest apalagi jika wajahnya kekanak kanakan lucu dan penuh senyum rasanya saya akan merasa nyaman berada di dekatnya wajah seperti ini membut saya ingin selalu melindungi dia sebaliknya wajah yang jutek membuat saya ingin kabur darinya

8110095 mccains tendency to speak too freely was proven when he made a distasteful joke at a fund raiser about the first family and then had to apologize to the president
8110096 the members of the society went forth to convert the world
8110097 make their home in a palace or the hut of a savage brave every danger suffer every hardship endure every privation to die of hunger thirst cold or heat disease or violence to labor without reward except that which the virgin mary would extend to them through their sacrifices to save souls from the clutches of the devil
8110098 they were to persuade men where persuasion was available employ force where force was possible
8110099 it was their province to spy out the actions of men meddle in all their affairs fathom the secrets of human hearts interfere in households in cabinets in halls of justice and legislation set father against son and son against father stir up strife between husband and wife mother and daughter
8110100 all earthly relations all human considerations all the ties which men deem sacred were subordinated to the idea that baptism into the church was of more value than anything else that they were commanded by the virgin to rescue men from perdition
8110101 to bring about that end by any means were justifiable each member was to watch every other member report their faithful
8110102 with a zeal such as the world had never before witnessed the jesuits went forth upon their missions
8110103 their history is interwoven with that of every nation a record of self denial hardship suffering martyrdom of burning zeal fiery energy tireless activity unquenchable ardor of religious devotions worldly wisdom benevolence and charity deceit falsehood hypocrisy cruelty and despotism
8110104 if they have been charitable and kind they have also blackened history by the darkest of crimes if they have lifted men to higher and nobler lives they have also sent myriads to prison and burnt hundreds of thousands at the stake
8110105 time has not quenched their zeal and though three hundred and fifty years have passed since their organization they are still making their power felt in every country controlling the consciences and actions of men
8110106 the tomahawk and scalping knife at the bidding of the jesuits will do bloody work from the penobscot to the ohio and the lurid light of burning dwellings will illumine the midnight sky
8110107 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move ever westward
8110108 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
8110109 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
8110110 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
8110111 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
8110112 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves

8110124 orientation is important because it allows new students to get acquainted with the campus and meet lots of other students before classes actually start
8110125 i think it was definitely nice being on the other side of things
8110126 i really looked up to my orientation leader freshman year and that really set the bar so im enjoying introducing the kids to all there is to offer at cornell
8110127 i have mixed feelings about how the orientation leader program has been set up because we had to go pick people up from different buildings which made things overly complicated
8110128 finding everyone was hard and it wastes a lot of time
8110129 its a great time to get partying out of your system with no responsibilities and no parents
8110130 and its a great time to catch up with your friends
8110131 basically for the folks that are getting the noise ordinances the fine is 500 thats a pretty hefty fine the law says is that if you can hear a party from 25 feet from the house theres a violation they just have to make sure they contain the amount of people keep noise and check peoples ids if you get caught serving a minor and the cops break up your party guess whos responsible the residents of the house

8110144 a strong influence over a young obama for nine years of his life rather than just four and was a sex pervert and pothead
8110145 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
8110146 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
8110147 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
8110148 how many of us are friends with unrepentant former terrorist bombers

8110150 god damn america for treating citizens as less than humans
8110151 god damn america as long as she tries to act like she is god and supreme
8110152 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because of stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own backyard america is chickens coming home to roost
8110153 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color the government lied
8110154 we have the two sets of analysis one thats real time which doesnt let us say exactly whats involved but lets us say whether or not we think there is a problem and then the other analysis allows us to get a magnifying glass if you like to further down into the information
8110155 it is a very large stack of car bodies so we are predicting it is going to burn for at least a day or two days and at this stage we cant do any more than keep pumping water onto the outside perimeter to stop it spreading further
8110156 it is a very deep seated fire and there is a lot of plastics inside the metal car bodies and so that is also causing some issue with the burning material
8110157 within a year we want to see increased information available for australian parents and within three years a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8110158 all australian schools public and private need to do more to demonstrate the outcomes they achieve with the resources they receive from the broader community
8110159 we averaged nearly 10 yards per carry on defense and defensively we continue to improve
8110160 this win means a lot to our team that we went out and accomplished our goal to win it was a total team effort everybody played a heck of a game there was a lot of gang tackling on defense and p j art daniels and huntley all ran the ball well on offense
8110161 carl and roger poole stepped up after that and said lets get the running game going after that we averaged 10 yards a carry
8110162 the gift that we share is the willingness to innovate the willingness to fail we are not waiting for air force one to rescue us
8110163 we havent had an honest conversation about things in the democratic conference
8110164 we democrats do a very good job of saying what were for
8110165 dont do a good job of discussing the things we dont like
8110166 we have to figure out how to address peoples anxieties
8110167 what democrats have to do is understand that republicans have it right
8110168 you dont know what you have until its real bullets flying
8110169 at this point i think i know how theyll respond but you dont know
8110170 weve got some more days to practice well get em ready theres a lot more learning to do we need to practice better than we did yesterday weve got to familiarize ourselves more with our opponent its a process and were not quite there yet
8110171 if you ever ask me on tuesday morning if youre ready to play the game on saturday id say no if you are then we could just pack it in and let them go to school the rest of the week
8110172 you just do what you do during the week over and over but to do that you have to practice the way youre going to play you cant just flick a switch and get ready you have to make the investment and do it during the week
8110173 he probably hasnt gotten a lot of sleep getting ready for the first game
8110174 i think maybe its a little bit of his personality he just wants to think about football i dont think he likes having to deal with the obligations that come with being nebraskas head football coach his gig is all football thats when hes really at ease
8110175 were a little nervous about what this winter will be to a lot of people
8110176 and the state needs to open more shelters this year
8110177 the lamps are going out all over europe we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime
8110178 so therefore theres some tickets here if you come to the university at buffalo at 7 oclock thursday those that are looking for a ticket we have tickets here at ub
8110179 i think they had a aa baseball team and i went to a lot of games
8110180 i think back to the 2004 convention that launched barack obama into national prominence
8110181 id like to do the back story on that how it was that a relatively obscure state senator from illinois gets thrown into that role
8110182 im excited about the fact that i get to help show off my home city and my home state to a worldwide audience
8110183 i feel like im getting close to 100 percent which is what i want to get to and the sooner i get there the better
8110184 thats very critical youve got to be out there making your mistakes and learning from those
8110185 i probably couldve gone back in the game if really pressed into it
8110186 the highlight of the renovation project is a new sports complex and stadium for sports including baseball softball soccer football and lacrosse all the field sports
8110187 the proposal includes renovating the performing arts center and construction of a 21st century technology wing a new fitness center and additional classrooms we need to make it a school of the 21st century
8110188 were putting this forward trying to make it so that there is no increase to the local taxpayer
8110189 when you do a capital improvement project like this the state will aid up to 89 percent of the costs while the local share comes form capital reserves which we have put aside for projects such as this
8110190 its a great proposal how else can you say it wed be able to play night games as would the other field sports that and the artificial turf are exciting to think about
8110191 our field is among the best in the league right now but over the past three or four years the lockport soccer boosters have been out here putting dirt down trying to level it off the new stadium would also allow us to host regional events for not just soccer but the other field sports as well
8110192 i want to stress again however that although its not a secret its still very preliminary
8110193 these three will need to put up good scores on a consistent basis for us
8110194 we are very lucky to be returning our entire lineup from last year and the fact that our key players have been playing a lot this summer
8110195 a solid core is returning the players have put in their time in the offseason and made nice improvements so if it translates over into league play we could challenge for the title
8110196 i started begging my parents to let me box when i was like nine or 10 years old
8110197 my mom surprised me with a gift certificate to casals
8110198 hes got a beautiful style to go pro and wed like to do that by the end of the year
8110199 i really want to see him do some good things these next two or three fights
8110200 i love being back in the gym every day after being out with the injuries
8110201 my number one dream is to be able to box for a living
8110202 he has a big local following hes a likable kid hes tough and i think hes going to be a good pro
8110203 i hadnt been on the ballot for 28 years so there was some anxiety wondering how the voters were going to judge my service
8110204 i thought it was going to be a little closer to tell the truth
8110205 but it was an experience i am glad i went through im still young and i really believe i can help people in the long run in public service
8110206 i found that there had been 11 deaths in germany and austria 26 fainted after they received the vaccine and received temporary paralysis in australia
8110207 the company that produces this vaccine is under inspection for shipments of the mmr vaccine that failed usual inspection but were distributed anyway and their vaccines for hepatitis b and pneumonia were recalled
8110208 i was singing the jingle before i even knew what it was
8110209 i just want my friends to think about this and know the facts
8110210 its important to put this into context vaccines can be useful they have played a very important role in eliminating serious infectious disease such as tetanus polio diphtheria
8110211 the issue here is the speed with which gardasil came into use and with which public health authorities have embraced its use
8110212 and thats precisely the same thing that happened with vioxx an anti inflammatory that precipitated what one expert estimated to have caused up to 140 000 heart attacks or other cardiac events worldwide and now is off the market
8110213 it came out again with huge fanfare a big fuss but no studies by independent researchers
8110214 the implication without ever being stated is that they dont need to go for a pap test
8110215 gardasil does not offer full protection it offers at best 70 per cent protection against four strains of hpv that cause cancer versus tetanus which offers 100 per cent protection theyve left out the other 30 per cent
8110216 most thoughtful observers would say that more independent scrutiny is needed as well as careful cost benefit analysis before gardasil can be endorsed wholeheartedly
8110217 the public health community has not in my opinion exercised due diligence
8110218 the gardasil story is an example of the totally inappropriate influence of whats call big pharma over health care practices and decision making
8110219 its wonderful to provide a vaccine that prevents 70 percent of cervical cancers
8110220 it will also prevent abnormal pap smears and the re testing thats required with that and the anxiety and angst abnormal pap smears cause
8110221 that has been used by some vaccine objectors to state this gardasil is unsafe

8110454 there is no one going in or out the situation is very bad with the rains and food is running out they are surrounding the camp
8110455 met with strong resistance from the instigated and mobilized displaced citizens who were incited to put barricades and to move in the streets
8110456 imagine in four months we could have an administration in washington that believes in science
8110457 lets hope that senator mccain when he returns to his life as a senator in january also returns to his senses on energy policy
8110458 we need to hold onto this country its just so precious
8110459 around that core of wild lands hundreds of millions more acres are healthy enough that they can still support the maintenance of resilient ecosystems
8110460 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8110461 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8110462 we will not easily arrest people if they dont break any law

8110465 the operator has been encouraged by the results of the brearley 1h 11 and analogous wells to the extent it has initiated early discussions on drilling a second horizontal into an adjoining acreae section this is a ringing endorsement of exomas land acquisition and farm out business model
8110466 i thought well its an annoyance but its not really hampering our work
8110467 and it was clear they werent upset about something in general they were upset with me
8110468 if you can learn who to avoid and who to seek out thats a lot easier than continually getting hurt
8110469 i think it allows these animals to survive with us and take advantage of us in a much safer more effective way

8110477 lo hacemos convencidos de que las inquietudes esenciales que inspiraron la fundaci n de el litoral siguen vigentes a pesar del tiempo transcurrido
8110478 hoy como ayer creemos en la misma premisa que el diario sustent desde sus inicios que el progreso est estrechamente ligado a una educaci n p blica eficiente
8110479 seguimos convencidos de que la escuela p blica mayoritaria y actualizada es la v a mas directa para construir una sociedad democr tica y pr spera al igual que entonces trabajamos para lograr una soluci n definitiva a las condiciones de pobreza que viven muchos en nuestra regi n por falta de trabajo y capacitaci n
8110480 que fue la continuidad del diario la palabra donde mi abuelo don salvador caputto trabaj y se destac con una pluma notable
8110481 fundar un diario con el fin de abrir un espacio de opini n e informar aventura a la que se uni dos a os m s tarde en las tareas administrativas don pedro vittori
8110482 desde el principio fue un diario que no hizo concesiones con el poder prepotente denunciando abusos y privilegios su l nea editorial siempre reconoci el rol del estado en la educaci n la salud y la seguridad defendi el desarrollo regional las libertades civiles y pol ticas e insisti en los beneficios de generar una cultura del trabajo

8110487 el diario el litoral naci con una profunda convicci n servir al pueblo
8110488 esa vocaci n por lo popular converg a fluidamente con la finalidad del periodismo lograr una comunicaci n masiva ya que las nociones de pueblo y masividad se asocian y retroalimentan en rigor sin la presencia activa de un pueblo vido de informaci n receptivo de las opiniones y cr tico de lo que se publica no habr a diarios ni peri dicos
8110489 el litoral se plante desde el primer momento contribuir a la obra de una sociedad abierta constituida por hombres libres y educados preparados para ganarse el sustento y ejercer su ciudadan a
8110490 desaf o mucho m s complejo que el que propone la obediencia debida del cliente sazonada por la tutela protectora del patriarca
8110491 para entenderlo hay que recordar que los hombres del diario militaban contra el r gimen conservador y sus rigideces sociales y pol ticas
8110492 promovemos una libertad arquitect nica apta para construir estructuras sociales din micas capaces de revisar errores con rapidez y de superarse continuamente a s mismas continu gustavo v ttori dentro de ese encuadre sostenemos a la libertad de prensa como una libertad operativa t ctica que cumple un papel clave en la estrategia general de la democracia constitucional

8110495 estamos a favor de una educaci n que nos abra las mentes y nos conecte con el mundo apoyamos una educaci n que sin dem rito de las pr dicas multiculturales vigorice nuestro castellano una de las tres lenguas m s habladas del mundo apoyamos a nuestros emprendedores y bregaremos por el trabajo decente el cumplimiento de las leyes y la vigencia de la constituci n
8110496 como nacimos del pueblo propiciaremos pol ticas sociales serias responsables comprometidas con la dignidad de los hombres para atender y promover a vastos sectores de nuestra poblaci n que est n hundidos en la miseria la frustraci n y la violencia
8110497 es un motivo de alegr a estar compartiendo estos 90 a os de el litoral
8110498 cuando decimos que una empresa lleva 90 a os informando es una empresa que ha vencido el entusiasmo inicial y se ha incorporado en una vasta regi n de la provincia como uno de los elementos fundamentales que hacen a la integraci n social

8110504 mccain voted 25 times against renewable energy biofuels solar energy and even wind power mccain took more than 1 million in contributions from energy companies now he wants to give those same energy companies 4 billion in tax breaks

8110510 who needs a doctor the healthy or the sick go figure out what this scripture means im after mercy not religion im here to invite outsiders not coddle insiders
8110511 what i have only recently come to see is that mercy is ultimately not a tool of judgment to be dispensed or withheld in response to our behavior but a free choice of a loving god originating from his tender heart
8110512 the wild card of mercy is a characteristic of god not just one of the many ministry arrows in his quiver it is who he is not just simply a description of what he so frequently does

8110523 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8110524 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands
8110525 since presenting our first offer weve spent a great deal of time meeting with the iam to focus on their contract priorities
8110526 we have made substantial movement in pay pension and health care weve withdrawn key proposals that were important to the company but of concern to the union we have been negotiating for more than four months weve had a thorough discussion of all of the issues and we are near the point of presenting a best and final offer that rewards boeing employees for their great work while allowing the company to sustain our success in the future

8110542 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8110543 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8110544 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8110545 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8110546 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last

8110548 samples from foreigners who are detained whether they have been charged or not
8110549 many innocent lives could have been saved had the government began this kind of dna sampling in the 1990s when the technology to do so first became available
8110550 now innocent peoples dna will be put into this huge codis database and it will be very difficult for them to get it out if they are not charged or convicted of a crime
8110551 t hose who support the expanded collection believe that dna sampling could get violent criminals off the streets and prevent them from committing more crimes
8110552 he has always been able to get by on guts and determination more than stuff

8110563 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies
8110564 and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8110565 in an effort to disguise a convention without a message and a candidate without any experience on meaningful energy policy repairing an economy or dangerous international affairs obama supporters are reduced to flimsy attacks
8110566 he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should and he doesnt understand how the policies that he has supported and wants to perpetuate have so terribly misfired
8110567 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8110568 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8110569 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8110570 it was once said of the first george bush it was said that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8110571 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus that bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8110572 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home
8110573 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them

8110592 kaveh mohseni a spokesman for the student movement coordination committee for democracy in iran calls biden a great friend of the mullahs he notes that bidens election campaigns have been financed by islamic charities of the iranian regime based in california and by the silicon iran network a loosely knit group of wealthy iranian american businessmen and women seeking to end the u s trade embargo on iran in exchange the senator does his best to aid the mullahs mohseni argues bidens ties to pro tehran lobbying groups are no secret but so far the elite media has avoided even mentioning the subject
8110593 lyndon johnson reportedly once said im quoting from memory of a colleague from his senate who from his perch on the foreign relations committee had become an arch critic of the war in vietnam its my fault the good people of decided to send the village idiot to washington and i had to find a committee for him i couldnt trust him with anything important to peoples daily lives but he liked to talk about faraway places it made him feel important so i put him on the foreign relations committee so you see its my fault joe biden may have more going for him than johnsons adversary did but you couldnt prove it by his positions on iraq or iran
8110594 the fifth column operatives working toward americas failure in iraq seek not only to wrest power from republicans whom they limn as a threat markedly greater than radical islam they seek to wield power in a direction that is post american they are offended not merely by the national interests but by the very idea of america free self determining exceptional and self assured
8110595 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8110596 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8110597 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8110598 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8110599 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8110600 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8110601 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8110602 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8110603 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8110604 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8110605 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8110606 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8110607 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8110608 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8110609 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8110610 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8110611 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8110612 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8110613 until he turned into the tasmanian devil and went whirling through the grove uprooting trees and flinging sorority girls about and generally wreaking havoc all of which is just too terrible to contemplate
8110614 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of
8110615 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama

8110620 its often the case when you get a better square for the knight that things start to happen
8110621 i feel very sentimental about the friendship and rapport that we have established over these few years here we are half a world apart never having met face to face of different race and different cultural background and we communicate as brothers or as father and son it is truly touching i treasure this friendship now especially when my life has reached such a low ebb
8110622 i look forward to challenging myself every week and competing against myself to see how much i progress
8110623 whenever in life will i get to compete against olympic gold medalists

8110626 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8110627 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8110628 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudices there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8110629 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8110630 i only wish i were a rocket scientist instead of a law school professor
8110631 was one of the great scientists of the 20th century and a leader in neglected tropical diseases
8110632 he inspired many during his lifetime and his vision led an entire field for many decades his legacy is one to be remembered
8110633 we had no immediate intention of carrying out experiments with poliomyelitis viruses
8110634 nevertheless from time to time we had considered the mounting evidence
8110635 effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit
8110636 okay okay everybody calm down the president is on the way hes gonna shoot the damn thing
8110637 yes the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8110638 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8110639 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8110640 now let me tell you if you think theres been dramatic changes in the world and in technology over the last 10 years you aint seen nothing yet the race is on and if you watched the olympics you know chinas going for the gold
8110641 how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8110642 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8110643 after sept 11 if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us every american would have said how can i do my part
8110644 john mccain promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8110645 whether its been rooting out corruption in politics fighting global climate change or calling for a new strategy in iraq john mccain has a record of making bipartisan change and barack obama does not
8110646 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8110647 jefferson got it right at the dawn of the 19th century and its our challenge to get it right at the dawn of the 21st
8110648 this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8110649 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8110650 understands that we must renew our commitment to the american story today
8110651 and you have nancy pelosi the first woman and you have michelle obama
8110652 i believe that hillary clintons speech did exactly what the dnc and the campaign wanted important thing is to be unified
8110653 she is such an amazing woman put a crack in ceiling maybe i could be president of the united states
8110654 all of a sudden he has to have a motorcade escort him just to talk to people at the train station
8110655 he made it a point to come here with his whole family were totally juiced
8110656 so just like someone would put up an ad to sell their used car essentially craigs list has a section that allows you to sell or put up services for erotic services
8110657 i think he did and hes going to have a problem for doing that i dont know if thats against the law but it certainly shows the relationship between the two
8110658 he would post up a profile of the victim on craigs list with the aim of basically promoting prostitution soliciting her out
8110659 but using the internet does that bring up additional problems well it depends whos charging it were very happy to stay in this building
8110660 the scary thing about the internet is although it offers us so many more opportunities to learn about the world and stay in touch with people it unfortunately also becomes a playground for predators
8110661 preocupa me o futuro porque l que vou passar o resto da minha vida
8110662 um dia eu vou morrer e tudo que restar de mim ser o links
8110663 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident werden

8110692 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8110693 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8110694 very honored for voters to have chosen me its really overwhelming first time i ran for office its just really overwhelming
8110695 we presented our alternative to voters as far as what issues we thought were important and mr cameron presented his and voters made their decision and we respect
8110696 i think more training more focusing on what our strengths are and more focusing on accountability so theyre on paper for the entire community to see thats the direction were making
8110697 the message is clear we in permatang pauh and in malaysia we demand change for freedom and justice
8110698 we want an independent judiciary we want the economy to benefit the vast majority not the corrupt few
8110699 i think he feels he has to ride the momentum and given what he has experienced over the past few weeks he will be more convinced than ever that he has to do that
8110700 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
8110701 but if you take a look i think at this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
8110702 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8110703 this measure has been effective on aug 14 and related parties have been notified of it
8110704 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8110705 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
8110706 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
8110707 i think this time i am going to be a little more prepared with having one at home already but its going to be a challenge because the one at home is 3 years old
8110708 its not for a lack of prenatal care we do a very good job of getting women into prenatal care
8110709 more than 90 percent of women in guilford county get prenatal care but still our babies are dying at a much higher rate then the average babies do
8110710 weve made great strides in trying to combat the infant mortality rate and actually have brought it down quite a bit
8110711 but we are still higher than the national average and still one of highest in the state
8110712 at this point from last year we were already at this number so before we are even starting into the final quarter of 2008 we are already seeing the same numbers we saw in 2007
8110713 and so i get the feeling that this year is going to be a little bit higher than last year was
8110714 part of that is awareness that people in the community are aware that our babies are dying at a higher rate getting education on how to prevent pre term delivery getting into care early getting good nutrition during pregnancy
8110715 i sent my mum a text phone message i love you and i am going down
8110716 i called her half an hour later and she couldnt believe i was ok
8110717 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
8110718 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
8110719 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8110720 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8110721 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8110722 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8110723 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8110724 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8110725 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
8110726 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8110727 we dont count by days we count by hours we think by tomorrow it will be finished
8110728 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield
8110729 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
8110730 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
8110731 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
8110732 first thing this morning they came in they read the board and they got right to work
8110733 ive got tests on fridays were going to have our reading test and spelling test were jumping in ready to go this year

8110736 im collecting information im increasing my knowledge base i want folks to come to me and say mo heres whats working well dont mess with that mo here are where the challenges are i want people to feel like they have a voice at the table
8110737 create a new downtown district where you can walk from one to the other past new residential buildings new job offering opportunities and through new parks
8110738 which we believe is a critical site for downtown and an opportunity to do mixed use development with a major commercial retail ground floor tenant
8110739 to follow the investment strategy that the consultants recommend they are asking for over 10 years that the city spend about 14 million
8110740 the average citizen will see a more vibrant cultural district more cultural opportunities and a more vibrant downtown overall
8110741 the clinical team dr z and r have expressed their views and to be fair to them dr z has perhaps a more stronger way presented concerns about delusional disorder
8110742 i have given a commitment to people in the 9 11 truth movement to continue requesting an apology until i have been given one
8110743 if i have not received an apology by august the 30th instead of protesting in auckland as i did last year i will be protesting outside whangarei base hospital
8110744 i want to know who the idiot in the green was
8110745 a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government
8110746 that the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to
8110747 that make up makes you look a a lot better on tv looks like that evil is starting to get to your soul your disgusting wicked new world order trash
8110748 its an awesome feeling to be officially ncaa to say that im an official ncaa college athlete
8110749 we just had to make sure that all of our process was in place and we had good coaches and fully functioning programs and we did such a good job of it that they granted us a wavier so we met all criteria within three years
8110750 it is thrilling to be part of ncaa and recruit women athletes who really care about being part of ncaa and all those activities so its going to be huge for us were thrilled
8110751 it should have an impact if north carolina voters just compare this weeks convention and the candidates against next weeks republican party convention and the candidates
8110752 youre going to see a lot more diversity a lot more youth and vitality this week then youll see in next weeks convention
8110753 i like the message im hearing out of barack obama
8110754 i think obama is right in focusing on the economy and education so that we continue to build on our creativity and innovation
8110755 i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for awhile im done
8110756 after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there
8110757 but i could only do this if i could commit 100 physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8110758 but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility

8110782 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
8110783 i am neither a corn breeder or an editor but a searcher for methods of bringing the inner light to outward manifestation
8110784 a lot of people live in north raleigh that havent been downtown for 10 or 20 years so if they were to come down and when they come down theyre often intimidated by having a hard time figuring out where to park
8110785 one of the recommendations is that because we have so many private spaces that were not being used that the city look at that first as an actual program for getting private spaces brought into the public market
8110786 i think personally one of the big solutions is to have electronic messaging boards outside of the parking decks that tell people how many parking spots are available to the general public
8110787 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
8110788 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats

8110790 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8110791 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8110792 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8110793 unfortunately i wont be able to stay in section 228 because it looks like it will be 7 500 for the psl and 400 for the game
8110794 i think thats unreasonable for anybody i dont care who you are so ill just move to the upper deck so i can keep my seven seats
8110795 my reaction was happiness that there was actually an option without psls

8110804 you couldnt see much of anything except the rain so if a tornado popped up there would be no warning no notice so we immediately contacted the media to tell people that if they were in a mobile home or vehicle to get out of that and seek stronger shelter

8110807 we have had a very robust economy in north carolina weve been growing a lot of people are being here so the early goals we set in north carolina to reduce our waste have not been met and have been growing

8110814 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8110815 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8110816 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way

8110824 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8110825 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8110826 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8110829 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8110830 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

8110839 we missed too many serves in that second game it kind of changes the momentum
8110840 you work really hard to get yourself back in the game and then you miss a serve it kind of deflates it a little bit
8110841 were doing a great job of playing until we get to 20 and then were not putting teams away were trying to coast the rest of the way
8110842 that will be something that we pay attention to throughout the season making sure we finish through to 25

8110890 we share the same common goal as the iraqi government and that is to turn over more and more of the security responsibilities to the iraqi security forces
8110891 thats proceeding well but at the end of the day nothing changes from the fact that we believe strongly that the withdrawal of u s forces of coalition forces ought to be based on the conditions on the ground and what we are seeing is a dramatically improved situation in iraq with respect to security and an ever increasingly capable iraqi security force
8110892 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8110893 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8110894 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8110895 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8110896 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8110897 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8110898 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8110899 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8110900 its early to say who was behind the attack we are looking into all aspects
8110901 they the militants believe this force has become a stooge promoting someone elses agenda
8110902 its no surprise that mccain and bush will be appearing together in the twin cities next week its pretty hard to tell them apart these days

8110911 classified military information and sensitive military technologies are high priority targets for the intelligence agencies of this country
8110912 an espionage operation run by the intelligence organization responsible for collecting scientific and technologic information for israel paid a us government employee to obtain us classified military intelligence documents

8110915 us technology has been acquired by china through israel in the form of the lavi fighter and possibly sam surface to air missile technology

8110917 the majority of steve amp barrys 276 stores will continue to serve customers
8110918 will acquire all steve amp barrys intellectual property rights including its celebrity and brand licenses and the companys key facilities including its port washington n y headquarters columbus ohio distribution center and certain overseas offices
8110919 i am very proud of what weve been able to accomplish with the bitten brand im very pleased that steve amp barrys will be able to continue to deliver on that mission and look forward to continuing our strong partnership
8110920 i have found the cover drive to be the most economical way of dispatching these creatures as the wily little buggers have a habit of trying to leap out of the way at the last moment i have managed to counteract this by playing the shot with a slightly open stance which allows me to make subtle corrections to the angle of the blade by adjusting my bottom hand grip on the bat

8110924 at a time when police are feeling isolated from the communities they are recruited from and live in this ideologically driven denial of democratic rights enjoyed by every other new zealander including public servants just aggravates that feeling of isolation
8110925 the policing bill went through more than two years of community consultation and development and the government policy after that process was that police should be able to serve on councils
8110926 now it has decided at the 11th hour with no consultation to reverse that policy and undermine the rights of every new zealand police officer
8110927 any substantive reason whatsoever for the about face other than a desire to satisfy new zealand first
8110928 i think the public will look at the reality and make up its own mind
8110929 it is a different matter with community boards which act in a purely advisory way and which are quite suitable bodies for police employees to play an active part in
8110930 quite frankly i am very disappointed association president greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8110931 police believed until the very last minute that labour opposed nz firsts bid to deny them the right to serve on councils but that was before they snuck their u turn clause into the policing bill
8110932 labour and nz first have just denied police officers an everyday democratic right enjoyed by every other person in this country
8110933 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente

8110935 nos parece que el gobierno se sigue aferrando a su posici n y no escucha a los pueblos amaz nicos nosotros no reclamamos por un tema de porcentaje nosotros reclamos respeto que nos escuchen y que cada vez que quieran legislar o tomar decisiones sobre las tierras comunales y ancestrales de la selva peruana que conversen con nosotros pues siempre hemos estado abierto al di logo sincero
8110936 para evitar el temor de una supuesta venta masiva de tierras ser a conveniente dejar en 66 el margen de decisi n de transferencia o venta definitiva y dijo que permitir a las comunidades de la sierra para la asociaci n alquiler joint venture con el 51 y de esta manera conciliar los criterios
8110937 que hasta el momento a pesar de nuestra solicitud no han respondido a nuestro pedido
8110938 pues el mundo ya sabe que el gobierno se comprometi a escucharnos y si ocurre lo contrario entonces el mundo tambi n sabr que los ind genas del per no pueden confiar en sus gobernantes

8110941 i want to go on record saying that i think that what cracker barrel is doing with its exclusive music program is a great opportunity for me and for other artists
8110942 im thrilled that they gave me the opportunity to create this album exclusively for their guests in this business where the internet has become so important to reach individual people shopping at cracker barrel is such a great gift
8110943 we are pleased and honored for the opportunity to work with kenny rogers on presenting new songs for our guests
8110944 this new album offers an opportunity to hear just how good kenny rogers is with new material as well as for another listen to some of his classics
8110945 i was just awarded two new projects from kenny rogers i am designing kennys new photography coffee table book called faces amp places it is a book filled with some of the most beautiful photography i have ever seen all shot by kenny himself it will be a retail piece and i am honored and flattered that he wanted me to do it i also just started his new concert tourbook which celebrates his 50 years in the music business this will be sold at all his shows worldwide a big thank you to kenny for his continued belief in what i do
8110946 dont waste your life in doubts and fears spend yourself on the work before you well assured that the right performance of this hours duties will be the best preparation for the hours or ages that follow it

8110949 theres no connection to drugs directly in this case at this point but just historically if criminals from detroit or individuals from detroit are here with no employment and no family connections theyre setting up a drug trade
8110950 i believe the outside presence has heightened and intensified some of the violence as you get people coming from communities where disputes are resolved with violence and here youve got to match that level of intensity
8110951 if they will call us even anonymously to make us aware of addresses descriptions vehicle descriptions
8110952 that can make the process a lot quicker for us pinpointing out of state criminal activity
8110953 maybe even aprils death as tragic and horrific as it was maybe itll bring us together as a west side community to start talking about what can we do
8110954 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8110955 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8110956 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8110957 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8110958 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8110959 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8110960 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8110961 to be honest i dont want to stump up money for a bloke ive never met and theres no way i want to be seen at something like that
8110962 i dont want to say too much but there will be a few union blokes heading along
8110963 but it really has nothing to do with the union its more them supporting mick
8110964 all the people that are coming are coming because theyre friends of mine and they support an innocent man

8110968 blogs engaged in this behavior are called spam blogs and can be recognized by their irrelevant repetitive or nonsensical text along with a large number of links usually all pointing to a single site
8110969 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8110970 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8110971 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8110972 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8110973 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8110974 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8110975 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8110976 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8110977 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8110978 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8110979 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8110980 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8110981 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8110982 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8110983 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8110984 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8110985 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8110986 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8110987 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8110988 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8110989 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8110990 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8110991 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8110992 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8110993 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8110994 no esperaba tantas muestras de afecto quiero agradecer a todos por su apoyo

8110997 what are we going to do for all these weeks its going to be horrible theres no television no cell phones no video games no malls
8110998 theres nothing to do here but watch television play video games and go to the mall
8110999 why not just give up when we see the mess the world is in sometimes we just want to throw our hands in the air and call it quits dont we
8111000 they look at the mess the world is in and they just throw their hands in the air and call it quits

8111021 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
8111022 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8111028 the company continues to invest in building our intellectual property and expanding the companys organisational capacity with the ambition of delivering projects at substantial scale
8111029 as such we have expanded our operational facilities into western australia to service our client base and deliver on ground projects in that state
8111030 what is clear is that demand for our services will escalate the known options for abating greenhouse gases are expensive in comparison to biological sequestration and we are confident that the recognition of biological carbon sinks as a technology will gain traction
8111031 which one of these did mr rudd tell us he was going to do before the election in other words he didnt go to the election saying he would increase taxes
8111032 australians are worse off today than they were a year ago and from our point of view the last thing the economy actually needs at the moment is tax increases
8111033 the board is extremely pleased that the companys growing maturity and capability has enabled us to exceed the aggressive growth targets we set for fy08
8111034 while the global economy is under significantly more pressure than it was a year ago mmas exposure to the offshore oil and gas industry gives the board confidence that the company can deliver ongoing growth in shareholder returns
8111035 in view of this the board has declared a fully franked dividend of 2 cents per share up from 1 cent per share in the previous corresponding period
8111036 furthermore the board has resolved to implement a new dividend policy commencing in the 2009 financial year mma will pay an interim and final dividend reflecting a payout ratio of between 40 and 50 the new dividend policy is designed to take into account the ongoing capital requirements of the company while at the same time transferring valuable franking credits to our shareholders
8111037 on this basis it is pleasing to note that the safety performance across the organization improved against all our measures
8111038 safety performance is one of the key operational determinants of success within the company and within the oil and gas industry overall consequently mma is continually working with our clients to provide a safe work environment
8111039 this type of work is vital to the ongoing development of the company and our success in this project positions us to well to take advantage of other development projects being planned
8111040 this is an extremely positive step for the company and will drive continued growth in earnings from our dampier supply base asset
8111041 fy08 was a year of significant growth for mma but equally importantly the company has established solid foundations for future growth
8111042 we have an exciting year in front of us as investment in fleet expansion and supply base infrastructure sets us up to take advantage of the world scale projects planned for our area of operations
8111043 in addition mma will have at least four vessels operating internationally over the year representing another major growth opportunity for the future
8111044 obviously that is having an impact on what is going on with the market hardly doing anything
8111045 we are hardly going to have any big movers out there
8111046 a fair bit of that has already been accounted into the market
8111047 the volatility we are getting at the moment one per cent is a fairly modest day

8111052 unless somebody comes to the top of the hill they might not look over here we have a sign out there with no names on it that does hurt a little bit people dont know were here
8111053 we definitely get a lot of people up here saying i didnt even know you were up here wal mart seems to take over the whole place
8111054 if you turn at the first turn and go to wal mart on the left side you are never going to see the sign you might just catch a glimpse of it but you might not know whats there
8111055 you got a brand new bank three new restaurants down the bottom of the hill opening got wal mart here getting some traffic and business wise i think its going to be a good move
8111056 a lot of planning teachers worked over the summer and i was proud of them we met as a staff several times to prepare for today and i think with all the extra attention helped lend itself to a smooth opening today says pitzer
8111057 day after fairfax media announces 550 job cuts age editor gets tapped
8111058 the report also identifies an increasing demand among consumers for food and wine tourism experiences
8111059 the food and wine tourism in australia report shows the barossa is the best place in the country for visitors to experience the attractions they expect in a food and wine tourism destination including a rural setting strong heritage values established events and a diverse range of activities
8111060 the findings of the report confirm what south australians have always known the barossa is far more than just a world class wine region
8111061 its food culture is unique and its calendar of events attracts thousands of visitors each year to enjoy the regions famous hospitality and flair for festivities in the year to march 2008 the barossa attracted 197 000 domestic visitors who spent 575 000 nights in the region up 9 on a year ago there were also 892 000 domestic day trips to the barossa in the year to march 2008 up 10 on the year to march 2007
8111062 the past financial year has been an impressive period for tourism barossa and has included the development and launch of the butcher baker winemaker trail and rewards card
8111063 i hope the government receives a fee from coles and woolworths for advertising and promotion of their brand
8111064 they are not being told where to get the best prices they are not being told if woolworths has the same price in all its stores which they dont they are not being told that the cheaper price may be in a supermarket that is 10 kilometres away and any saving they make is lost in the cost of petrol
8111065 the large supermarkets are often found in big malls does grocery choice take into account the cost of parking
8111066 independents are often found in suburbs does grocery choice include a factor for convenience of shopping on the way home
8111067 cosboa has access to experts who can help the government design and publish a website that provides more useful information to consumers until then the site must be closed down
8111068 this is about giving consumers something new that the supermarket chains wont tell them who is the cheapest overall in their area
8111069 this is a government who actually believes that greater competition and transparency will benefit the consumer and thats where we are focused
8111070 ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed

8111072 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8111073 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8111074 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8111075 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8111076 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8111077 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits
8111078 we have lost more marines as a result of motorcycle accidents this year than we ever have before

8111082 the south african native is probably the one impossible person to train in the entire world he is probably impossible by any human standard
8111083 one of the reasons they the japanese have bad eyesight is probably these microscopic characters furigana which have many lines and strokes to them amp we wonder why they went mad and bombed pearl harbor when they knew they couldnt win that the japanese language would be a reason
8111084 hes the arab been going crazy steadily and gradually ever since he lost the early very fertile basins of the middle east hes been going crazy ever since he failed to learn wheat farming and brought about the erosion of all of the fertile areas of the middle east this race has been going for a very very long time and has been eating death for a very long time and it is death
8111085 the problem of south africa is different than the world thinks there is no native problem the native worker gets more than white workers do in england the south african government is not a police state its easier on people than the united states government
8111086 never discuss scientology with the critic just discuss his or her crimes known and unknown
8111087 we are slowly and carefully teaching the unholy a lesson it is as follows we are not a law enforcement agency but we will become interested in the crimes of people who seek to stop us if you oppose scientology we promptly look up and find and expose your crimes if you leave us alone we will leave you alone its very simple even a fool can grasp that and dont underrate our ability to carry it out
8111088 and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorses degraded novels self abnegation has filled the southeast asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax
8111089 make money make more money make other people make money
8111090 drew says he invested a bundle in a company called pay by touch through ubs but the bank concealed the criminal past of john rogers the founder of pay by touch rogers raised 130 mil from investors but made a grand total of 700k
8111091 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8111092 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8111093 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8111094 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8111095 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8111096 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8111097 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8111098 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8111099 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8111100 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8111101 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8111102 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8111103 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8111104 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8111105 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8111106 who are open to doing something on the production side
8111107 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8111108 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8111109 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8111110 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8111111 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8111112 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8111113 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8111114 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8111115 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8111116 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8111117 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8111118 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8111119 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8111120 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8111121 its such an international game that the opportunities to play rugby around the world are great
8111122 i cant imagine anything better over the next four to five years than maybe to end up in japan or wales or italy or france
8111123 whether i get on the field or not ive had a great ride over the last 10 seasons
8111124 theres been great support too i think im going to be more emotional about the support ive had from all the fans and from family
8111125 clinton toopi and i couldnt believe it we were hugging and jumping around grand final week was probably the best experience of my life
8111126 i havent been able to find my groove and i dont blame anyone else for me not playing well
8111127 unfortunately i had a couple of bad runs with injuries i got a few opportunities to stamp my position but i couldnt do it
8111128 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8111129 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8111130 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8111131 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8111132 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8111133 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8111134 they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8111135 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8111136 we found that cricket is a very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8111137 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8111138 its important to note that this restaurant like a courageous superhero has two sides
8111139 sometimes theres so much beauty in the world i feel like i cant take it

8111157 what would you do if you learned one day that your spiritual teacher sexually harassed his male disciples and covered up his sexual affairs a plagiarist who lifted his teachings from other traditions without due reference a spendthrift who lived extravagantly though he took a vow of poverty a questionable business man who engaged in risky and possibly illegal activities and a religious charlatan who consistently told untruths about a variety of issues

8111181 20 of americans have had a revelation from god in the last year and 13 have seen or sensed the presence of an angel
8111182 ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation
8111183 with a perhaps lesser degree of certainty consider the personal accounts of reputable christians
8111184 for by him all things were created both in the heavens and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities a reference to angels all things have been created by him and for him
8111185 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels waging war with the dragon and the dragon and his angels waged war
8111186 therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness
8111187 bless the lord you his angels mighty in strength who perform his word obeying the voice of his word bless the lord all you his hosts you who serve him doing his will
8111188 are they not all ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation
8111189 see that you do not despise one of these little ones for i say to you that their angels in heaven continually behold the face of my father who is in heaven
8111190 some friends and i followed you into the jungle knowing you would camp overnight we waited for you to go to sleep and planned to kill you and take your money and drugs just as we were about to move into your campsite we saw that you were surrounded by 26 armed guards
8111191 no sir i was not the only one to see the guards my jave friends also saw them and we all counted them it was because of those guards that we were afraid and left you alone
8111192 can you tell me the exact date when this happened
8111193 on that night in africa it was morning here i was preparing to play golf as i put my bag in the car i felt the lord leading me to pray for you in fact the urging was so strong that i called the men of this church together to pray for you will all of those men who met with me that day please stand

8111196 you wont believe this but when we returned to our village via the route we had taken to get you to the hospital that red cross building was gone there was nothing there in the place where it was
8111197 i doubt that many figurines of punishing angels found their way into gift boxes last christmas but the bible doesnt hesitate to describe this part of their activity
8111198 knowledge given from above and brought forth in more detail by the high angelic master sheate lady master cassandra and angel carpelpous and the master angel one on high
8111199 angels dont fall out of the sky they emerge from within
8111200 the whole purpose in life is to know your angel self accept it and be it in this way we finally experience true oneness
8111201 the wondrous light of the angels from the elohim to the archangels to the devas and nature spirits are all bringing to you the realization that you are magnificent you are divine now and divine first
8111202 do not do that i am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
8111203 do not do that i am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book worship god
8111204 yes for me it is like an inner voice that tells me what to do and what not to do where to go and where not to go its somebody like god that protects and cares for me
8111205 you seem to be really down and are without hope arent you

8111212 the excuses presented in the cabinet briefing paper simply dont stack up
8111213 the paper acknowledges that better organisation such as separate ballot boxes and colour coding would solve many of the problems experienced in 1999
8111214 it is also an insult to voters to suggest that voters would be confused by an extra question in the ballot box voters have been able to grasp the far more difficult mmp voting process

8111269 the public wants to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens

8111303 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8111304 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8111305 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8111306 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8111307 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system

8111334 this years alc will offer a clear vision of what the icons of the civil rights movement promised a nation full of equal opportunities for all of its citizens
8111335 the conference will be filled with dynamic social and policy content and the debate watch sessions are sure to be memorable everyone will leave the conference better informed and motivated to make a difference back in their communities
8111336 the annual legislative conference is a time for the community to gather from around the country present our shared issues brainstorm resolutions and establish an action plan for the coming year
8111337 we look forward to all contributions as we move forward to address the issues that disproportionately impact african americans and other people of color
8111338 in racial division they are not interested they are sort of bored with it
8111339 the most open discussion of race since the civil rights movement in many ways that is a wonderful moment
8111340 are sometimes reluctant to see what they worked for come to fruition which is a nonracist society because they really want that to happen but it is very difficult to give up on
8111341 it opens your eyes to the concept that black talent is much wider and much more expansive than you thought it was
8111342 everything has changed now and it has become much more complex at that time i touched a very raw nerve as the memory of the 60s was much closer
8111343 it is like othello everybody focuses on the fact that othello is black it is the least important thing about him
8111344 who wants to talk about issues when you can talk about oh hes black
8111345 it would do a great deal for americas image of itself and i dont mean young black boys and girls who can say with a loud resounding voice i can i can

8111355 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8111356 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8111357 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8111358 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8111359 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8111360 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8111361 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8111362 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8111435 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8111436 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8111437 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8111452 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8111453 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8111454 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8111455 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8111456 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8111457 an energy policy that basically says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us

8111466 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8111467 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
8111468 coastal storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area
8111469 barack obamas grandfather stanley dunham told him theres nothing you cant do if he or she is willing to work hard enough its the same idea thats written in the seal of kansas to the stars through difficulty for too many families reaching the stars is more difficult than ever before
8111470 im sure you all remember that girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains case theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home
8111471 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8111472 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8111473 its still a buyers market and likely to be so for a while
8111474 the supply of homes is going to remain very large for quite some time and that means prices are far from hitting bottom
8111475 sales are probably not going to rebound anytime soon because the mortgage conditions continue to get tighter
8111476 so much excess supply out there prices have still got to come down some more
8111477 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8111478 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8111479 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8111480 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8111481 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8111482 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8111483 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8111484 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8111485 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8111486 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8111487 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8111488 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8111489 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8111490 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8111491 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8111492 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8111493 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8111494 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8111495 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8111496 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8111497 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8111498 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8111499 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8111500 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8111501 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing

8111504 surely sanctions cannot be good for any zimbabwean and we have abundant evidence of their ravaging impact we cannot condone such blatant spiteful injury

8111514 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
8111515 nothing nothing is gonna keep me away form this special gathering tonight
8111516 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and bold endeavors
8111517 our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
8111518 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8111519 but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8111520 aus technologischer sicht gibt es keine relevanten unterschiede zwischen den werkzeugen wir k nnen also beim gedanken an neanderthaler nicht mehr davon ausgehen dass sie dumm oder weniger fortschrittlich waren sondern ihre methoden waren einfach anders
8111521 me despert porque las luces llegaron hasta la parte de atr s
8111522 mi esposo vio esta luz brillante de color naranja corri hasta el loft para echar un vistazo y de repente se alejaron era como un bal n de rugby naranja brillante y hab a una especie de halo en torno a ella como un farol de la calle se movi arriba y a la izquierda muy r pidamente
8111523 desapareci en las nubes a continuaci n poco despu s la otra hizo exactamente lo mismo en el mismo punto en las nubes hab a cuatro en total
8111524 yo fui a internet despu s de lo ocurrido y encontr que muchas personas han visto cosas similares no creo que se tratara de linternas chinas porque habr amos visto una llama por debajo de ella pensamos que tal vez era alg n avi n militar pero no pudimos o r ning n motor nunca he visto nada igual en mi vida yo no hab a estado bebiendo alcohol lo juro yo soy la primera en ser esc ptica en algo por el estilo
8111525 los que he visto son peque os alrededor de 85 cm de altura pero estaba oscuro y era dif cil ver de manera adecuada
8111526 no s lo que son pero parecen ser una especie de h brido entre orangut n o chimpanc sin cola
8111527 he subido al macizo dhaulagiri monta a blanca cuatro veces y cada vez he visto las huellas del yeti
8111528 en 1971 uno de los miembros de mi expedici n vio una de estas criaturas
8111529 estaba a tan s lo 15 metros de l y lo observ por alrededor de 40 segundos
8111530 se trataba de algo parecido a un hombre de 150 cm de altura y estaba parado sobren sus patas traseras su cabeza estaba cubierta con una larga y gruesa cabellera y est bamos seguros de que no era un oso o un mono
8111531 definitivamente los animales hab an visitado la cueva y hab a m s huellas en la nieve alrededor de la boca de la caverna
8111532 las huellas que vi eran similares a las fotografiadas por los exploradores brit nicos eric shipton y michael ward en 1951
8111533 he encontrado m s peque as y m s delgados m s como un pie humano con un arco entre el tal n y los dedos de los pies
8111534 what causes quarrels and what causes fights among you is it not this that your passions are at war within you you desire and do not have so you murder you covet and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel
8111535 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111536 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8111537 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8111538 to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8111539 i want you to ask yourself were you in this campaign just for me
8111540 we dont need four more years of the last four year
8111541 24 early next year and wanted to see which card might be the better bet down the road
8111542 the most significant tool we have to reduce tobacco use among young people is tobacco taxation
8111543 i buy at least three packs a week thats six bucks a week
8111544 as finance minister id rather see the whole picture before i start making allocations i might wish we could change
8111545 unallocated is an indication that we want to get another two to three months under our belt a little clearer indication a little more opportunity to talk to our caucus about the savings
8111546 if the prices go down we have opportunities in our capital and perhaps our savings to make some adjustments
8111547 this time we have an opportunity to look slightly differently at the surplus policy
8111548 the difference is that were taking into account a huge and important need for this government to recognize what we needed to do with carbon capture and storage
8111549 if were going to have a bonanza then i think we need to be brave we need to be mavericks we need to save all of the money
8111550 its an enormous slush fund that the government can draw on when they need to quench a political fire
8111551 this is massive massive money and were only talking about 2 5 billion maybe getting saved
8111552 rick philion hazen head coach and i think theyre very excited theyve sat in the wings some of these guys for two three years now behind some talented kids and theyre ready to show what theyve got at the same point inexperience does show every once in a while theres something that happens that they werent ready for and they dont bounce back quite as quick as we hope they would sometimes but hey theyre working hard
8111553 hello hope yer having a good day just feed me the os cd so i can do all the work
8111554 statement by the prime minister of canada august 26 2008 ottawa ontario lieutenant governor of ontario to represent canada at the paralympic games opening ceremony prime minister stephen harper today announced that his honour the honourable david c onley lieutenant governor of ontario will represent canada at the opening ceremony of the beijing 2008 paralympic games to be held on september 6 2008 the lieutenant governor will travel to china instead of her excellency the right honourable micha lle jean governor general of canada
8111555 if its coming this is going to be a watershed election for us and most probably will be the most divisive and nasty election in canadian history
8111556 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8111557 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8111558 politi tjenestemennene behandlet familien p en veldig hard og ydmykende m te det ble brukt t regass mot dem de ble sl tt og utskjelt
8111559 we just started out just wanting to educate our palates
8111560 wed try to identify local producers of grass fed beef free range chickens and fresh organic eggs once youve had those things you dont want to go back but first youve got to source them
8111561 unite the growing sustainable food movement and introduce thousands of people to food that is good clean and fair
8111562 were trying to get as many texas products there as possible
8111563 but its not easy because of the distance and expense involved
8111564 how much gasoline it took to get the food here
8111565 make government an institution of public good not private plunder
8111566 with all these athletes in china i wonder if theyll all get a chance to meet the kids that make their gear
8111567 the daily show no canadian content there either but at least its palatable watching
8111568 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111569 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8111570 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8111571 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8111572 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8111573 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111574 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8111575 it came out of the blue im disappointed if any adult takes advantage of his or her position as a teacher and role model she was popular and she produced a good yearbook she seemed like a regular teacher
8111576 duarte stated she could not remember when she gave student a cocaine
8111577 however she believes it was approximately one week after she gave cocaine to student b
8111578 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111579 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8111580 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8111581 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8111582 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8111583 the more i amp r work we do the less we get come contract time
8111584 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8111585 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8111586 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8111587 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8111588 you can tell a a man who boozes by the company he chooses and you can tell volumes about a politician comfortable with the likes of acorn tony rezko jeremiah wright and william ayers
8111589 and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since he talked about
8111590 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for
8111591 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position
8111592 at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices when americans are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted twenty five times against renewable energy
8111593 against biofuels against solar energy he even voted against wind energy
8111594 if you drilled in all of senator mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well
8111595 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8111596 my friends it is time for us to take back our country senator clinton said early on in her speech
8111597 it is time for us to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team
8111598 and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8111599 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8111600 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you it in for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8111601 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8111602 it is a way to build distributed services across multiple vendors while still keeping your data as private and safe as you would like it to be you can limit it for example for time like only one day only read access photos only and not videos etc
8111603 descobrirmos que o sentimento de felicidade e otimismo tem um efeito de prote o
8111604 kebakaran terjadi sekitar pukul 09 40 wib dan sekarang kita masih memadamkan sisa sisa bara yang masih terbakar
8111605 you can tell a a man who boozes by the company he chooses and you can tell volumes about a politician comfortable with the likes of acorn tony rezko jeremiah wright and william ayers
8111606 i wonder who had a hit first chuck berry or little richard
8111607 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
8111608 i am a proud american a proud senator from the state of new york and a proud supporter of barack obama
8111609 why are there israeli but not mexican american dual nationals
8111610 with intent or reason to believe it would be used to the injury of the united states or to the advantage of a foreign nation israel attempted to communicate deliver or transmit classified confidential and secret information relating to the national defense to a representative officer agent or employee of a foreign government
8111611 shall lose his u s nationality by voting in a political election in a foreign state
8111612 to more than 12 years in prison for giving classified information to an israeli diplomat
8111613 remain free while the government continues with the wider case
8111614 prison time could be sharply reduced in return for his help in prosecuting
8111615 we think he is well suited and will do an excellent job
8111616 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
8111617 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
8111618 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
8111619 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs
8111620 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
8111621 why are the americans talking about getting rid of settlements when they are building a new one right next door
8111622 i agree on the expo hall hours i guess i was on the border of the trapper keeper generation so can
8111623 i love your frank comments kevin your observation about people saying what associations must
8111624 david you made me feel so much better we were all calling them trapper keepers in the daily now
8111625 ive never seen the level of activism i now see
8111626 the number of people who have become more active and visible on the national political front has increased dramatically because people have suddenly sensed that they have to be more active in order to defend themselves as americans defend themselves as arabs and muslims
8111627 in talking to muslims theyre really struggling between two things they dont know whether to view barack obama as a lesser of two evils or a really good candidate that they are excited about
8111628 a lot are apprehensive whether to fully endorse barack obama but theres no doubt they view him as a better candidate than mccain
8111629 if he can do it we can we can reach very high goals for many muslims especially after 9 11 have felt discriminated against hehas given us a lot of hope and inspiration
8111630 people may have thought this will be perfect and very different
8111631 it is different but its not perfect because politics isnt perfect
8111632 change is the issue and change is a word i think that refers to the economy civil liberties and foreign policy and the general mess people think were in
8111633 if the candidates cannot engage the american muslim community in a healthy way which is the worlds most educated muslim community then how can they strengthen economic ties or have a meaningful successful diplomacy in the muslim world
8111634 this is a way of raising our voice in a democratic society
8111635 since were a democratic party group we are sold on the idea of being democrat but we would raise concerns of the muslim community in the democratic party
8111636 part of being a leader is taking stances that are difficult standing up for whats right
8111637 whats right is a vast majority of muslims love this country and feel very blessed to be in this country
8111638 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8111639 he stole the ground from under our feet and he took the sky from above our heads he killed our sons
8111640 and what we get in return is a theatre performance the world is looking at this as if it were a spectacle
8111641 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
8111642 this is not your fathers pinball game this unique sci fi take on pinball includes enemies power ups bonus stages and hidden surprises we know players will love
8111643 alien crush returns is making pinball more sci fi than ever
8111644 this is not your fathers pinball game this unique sci fi take on pinball includes enemies power ups bonus stages and hidden surprises we know players will love
8111645 this is so cool if this is what we think it is
8111646 wouldnt you rather be here first introduced in 1986 the
8111647 as a proud supporter of barack obama now is time to unite for the same purpose it is a fight we must win together we shall not sit on the sidelines
8111648 we dont need four more years of the last four years
8111649 it is fitting that next week bush and mccain will be together in the twin cities of minnesota and st paul as they are like twins the same
8111650 he has asked for my money but not for my vote
8111651 i understand your heartbreak if i had been on the loosing side of this primary my supporters would have been heartbroken too both senator clinton and myself represent americans who have been left out of the system for too long who have suffered from discrimination who have waited lifetimes for this moment of hope for all of us this has not just been a campaign merely of ideas and message but one of heart and soul to those supporters of senator clinton who have had their hopes dashed by her loss i cannot give you your candidate i cannot be her but i can tell you that i will work like hell from the moment i am in office to make sure that no one is ever left out again and so on

8111660 when i see the sales ads for furniture or large appliances i basically
8111661 alverson this election has nothing to do with what happened 40 years ago frankly im sick of regurgitating the 60s every four years give john mccain a medal a gold watch and a handshake we need a president focused on 2010s not the 60s
8111662 it was until 1968 i think every reporter secretly craves for the world to blow up during one of these things
8111663 in any rational trial the defendant would walk because you wouldnt be able to prove that love actually exists
8111664 i agree that we can never know the internal workings of anyones mind but assessment of the motives of political figures goes at least as far back as the ancient greeks and the origins as we know of democracy indeed its part of the democratic process
8111665 i certainly dont think if obama loses that it would be anyones fault as much as his

8111698 we citizens have come to feel isolated uneasy with other people especially authority figures so we became people pleasers even though we lose our own identities in the process we citizens often mistake any personal criticism as a threat
8111699 we citizens took on another compulsive personality such as a workaholic we live life from the standpoint of victims we became reactors rather than actors letting others take the initiative
8111700 we citizens became dependent personalities terrified of abandonment willing to do almost anything to hold onto a relationship in order not to be abandoned yet our country keep choosing insecure relationships
8111701 as citizens we learn to keep our feelings down and bury them deeper year after year we confuse love with pity tending to love those we can rescue even more self defeating we become addicted to excitement in all our affairs preferring constant upset to workable relationships

8111737 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8111738 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8111739 we realised later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8111740 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi
8111741 she was very angry by the sound of her voice when she asked the danish media to leave
8111742 i got the impression she did not want to be hassled
8111743 what if we finally got the candidate this great nation deserves
8111744 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8111745 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8111746 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8111747 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8111748 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8111749 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8111750 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8111751 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8111752 they got a group between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8111753 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8111754 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111755 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8111756 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8111757 well if i dont take this medicine what could happen
8111758 well you just might develop uncomfortable symptoms from the infection itching burning that kind of stuff
8111759 im all done i dont like this please im all done
8111760 pee pee baby go pee pee please please just pee pee baby
8111761 90 percent of the kids who took the preventative antibiotics developed an antibiotic resistant recurrent infection
8111762 oh my goodness oh my goodness look at your eye what is wrong with your eye
8111763 if you have had an allergic reaction to ciprofloxacin do not use this product
8111764 was constructed around this trick and the fan was rewarded although staff were appointed to read every letter sent in few usable ideas were obtained in this way 2
8111765 when mixed with water just not enough to destroy a concrete wall the amount of sodium required to destroy a concrete wall would greatly exceed the size of a cold pill
8111766 the oil combines with the fibers in the padding to create a low level spontaneous combustion
8111767 the ferrous oxide and the aluminum shavings should generate enough heat to explode the battery
8111768 ibm is an important anchor tenant of the universitys technology park and ibm has attracted additional technology based businesses to ballarat professor battersby said
8111769 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1350 employees across 30 enterprises
8111770 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8111771 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8111772 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8111773 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8111774 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8111775 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8111776 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8111777 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8111778 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8111779 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8111780 this election comes down to a simple question do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8111781 let big oil determine and even write our national energy policy
8111782 for the last eight years the bush cheney team stonewalled the taxing of oil company profits and prevented efforts to promote alternative energy production and guess who voted with the bush administration 90 percent of the time john mccain
8111783 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8111784 this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit
8111785 up with obama biden wake up america wake up america wake up america
8111786 once in a lifetime the poet said once in a lifetime hope and history meet in one extraordinary man i thank the good lord that i have lived long enough to meet and help such a man twice in my lifetime john kennedy and barack obama
8111787 o que eu tenho a perder al m de 6 selos e r 12 00
8111788 there are people in this hospital who dont know what i did
8111789 i have seen many patients who have committed murders and rapes who have been involved in sexual torture of victims who have changed dramatically on these medications to the point where they are nowhere near the risk they were
8111790 when i give them the medication many say it is like having a vacation from the deviant thoughts that have plagued them all their lives
8111791 our outpatient clinic which looks after medium to high risk offenders has been running for seven years we treat about 200 patients a year a quarter of whom get antilibidinal medication and we have never had anyone reoffend with a hands on sex crime
8111792 from the age of 11 i was having sexual fantasies
8111793 i was passed around relatives and care homes when i started having fantasies i was living with my aunt and i remember that the thoughts turned to killing i thought about raping and killing her and those thoughts scared me
8111794 that day i was ready to explode id spent half my life fighting thoughts that urged me to rape and kill rape and kill
8111795 i remember walking round the living room with my rifle then i remembered their daughter katie the previous week i had asked her to make love to me she had said no she was a virgin and i respected that but now this thought pushed me over the edge i went from room to room and shot them one by one undressed katies body laid her down and looked at her i didnt touch her now i realise that was the motivation for the killings it was not simply the anger it was sexual the difference between killing them all and not killing them was that girl and i learnt that before i could ever be considered safe it was this paedophilia that i would have to deal with
8111796 before i was never able to meet a woman without thinking about sex
8111797 since being on the lupron i have no sex drive for the first time i have established friendships with women patients that have nothing to do with sex i can get on with life like a normal person
8111798 i come from a dysfunctional family ive been in trouble with the law since i was 8 sex has been part of my life as far back as i can remember my first offence i didnt get charged it was a six year old girl in a group home that i was in i was 13 at the time
8111799 i had been working and drinking with the boys and doing drugs too instead of going to meet my wife and son i saw three girls going into the mall
8111800 i followed them and managed to coerce one outside i got her into an enclosed area held her hand and offered her money for sex it scared the daylights out of her she was about 10
8111801 ive been on medication in the past and found that it didnt help now im on lupron and there is no sex drive there are no sexual desires if id heard of this years ago it would probably have saved me a lot of time in jail and saved a lot of victims
8111802 i dont think id be a danger because ive gone through the programme ive learnt how to see triggers things i wouldnt have thought about in the past that led to my offences
8111803 my psychiatrist was hesitant about putting me on the medication
8111804 i had to say look this is killing me i was inundated with sexually deviant thoughts and i convinced the doctor to let me have it those thoughts went away after a while i stopped thinking deviant thoughts about children without it i would have committed suicide by now
8111805 were aiming to set up protocols for people to follow and to provide supervision and consultation
8111806 i heard about grubins work and met him to find out about the treatment now i am treating my first patient with cyproterone acetate androcur and the results have been amazing
8111807 i had even convinced myself at the time that i was doing nothing wrong
8111808 i have always had urges and sexual fantasies about children when i was offered the chance to go on this medication i was worried at first but i wanted to solve my problems now the urges and thoughts have gone away and i have counselling to help me to understand my problem and deal with it for the first time i can imagine having a positive future
8111809 there may be those who dont like the idea of offenders receiving help
8111810 but these are not individuals who are going to be released because of this treatment they are offenders who have served their time this isnt part of the punishment but aims to reduce the likelihood that they will need to be punished again the question is do you want them out there with treatment or without it
8111811 i hope my medication will stop me having these fantasies so i wont act them out
8111812 i want my life back to be a normal person
8111813 i promised that before i harmed anyone id kill myself
8111814 hes my life if you damage him you damage me the whole street loves him hes really active and a healthy boy
8111815 its a big shock to the family it has hit the mother especially hard she was in shock and hasnt eaten since it happened and the father was all over the place
8111816 he didnt know the kids were going to be there at the time
8111817 i dont like the guns but they have gone now if they havent gone i will make sure
8111818 they have kept him unconscious in hospital so that way he doesnt move around its too early to say at the moment whatll happen
8111819 this is our floor time to go have your picture taken
8111820 no part of the content or the blog may be reproduced without prior written permission
8111821 cuestiona entre otras cosas que los funcionarios de la presidencia de la rep blica hubiesen ocultado tales hechos en lugar de haber efectuado las denuncias pertinentes cuando era oportuno
8111822 como ministerio del poder popular para los pueblos ind genas estamos apoyando ese proceso respetando los derechos de los pueblos ind genas y los derechos de todos porque la revoluci n lleg para apoyar a los m s d biles
8111823 todo esto ha sido un trabajo que se ha venido haciendo pero por supuesto es necesario que se acelere y se trabaje permanentemente
8111824 el pueblo ind gena sabe que el gobierno bolivariano es el nico que le ha reconocido sus derechos hace diez a os no ten amos nada y hoy tenemos derechos todos
8111825 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer
8111826 but we are a small country there cant be 10 people out there who dont already have strong opinions about this man and what hes done
8111827 list items a through e i can handle but your fn g will be the undoing of us all
8111828 tough action is necessary if we are to achieve real change
8111829 there wasnt a seat to be had but as packed as we all were i couldnt believe how cooperative and friendly everyone was everyone was helping everyone it was such a great experience
8111830 when ted came out everyone around me was crying honestly nobody really expected him to make a speech
8111831 hey we were all choked up and fired up people around me were hootin and hollerin
8111832 i cant believe how quiet it was when michelle was up there all those talkative people suddenly went completely silent the whole place was riveted
8111833 the press wants to make a stink about hillary supporters being unhappy but honestly we just dont see it materializing
8111834 when ted and michelle were on stage i really dont think anyone was thinking of anything or anyone else
8111835 i dont hink its gonna work out like its supposed to
8111836 if jerry wins this i might as well pack my bags
8111837 any time i can be in a costume it reminds me of mardi gras
8111838 how did i get black balled for someone elses deal
8111839 n o me acho sexy mas engano bem para a pessoa ser sensual n o precisa ter esse objetivo n o propositalmente que se consegue isso
8111840 todo namorado diz que eu bagun o bastante a pia do banheiro uso at a mesma escova de dente que o ernani porque tenho pregui a de comprar uma nova
8111841 the practical joke didnt work you dont brag about jokes that dont work
8111842 it violated policy but if it was a joke it was not a crime
8111843 it might not be the most brilliant plan in the world but it isnt criminal theft
8111844 no way does an officer mess with money on a search
8111845 enough evidence for the jury to find the defendants guilty
8111846 he wanted to stuff the money up in the toilet and couldnt find a rubber glove to do it
8111847 because you didnt want anyone to know about this so a report that omits material facts is accurate
8111848 were not going to put jokes in our police report
8111849 im not going to say i lied on my tax returns
8111850 we had absolutely no intention of doing anything with that money other than turn it in
8111851 his words were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8111852 i rang the treasurer and he flatly denies it absolutely not true
8111853 it was a question asked of him at a branch meeting about the proceeds and the treasurer made the point that if the electricity reform doesnt proceed there is no other additional infrastructure package for anyone
8111854 i am very happy to be back healthy playing well and winning the first round is always great fun
8111855 but its been a hard year especially the beginning and it was difficult trying to get back into rhythm
8111856 for the long term and for the good of the program this is in our best interest
8111857 tyrod wanted to redshirt and we are trying to do what is in his best interest for him
8111858 i wanted this to be settled and that is the way i like things to be now we know what direction we will be going in this season
8111859 he had tremendous get off he wasnt like a five star recruit but there were a lot of things we liked
8111860 i dont think it was so much him that convinced me to go there sc is a great place and they have great coaching and always have
8111861 i noticed they were on their way up when i was coming in and i wanted to be part of that
8111862 hes a great player who played hard every down with great technique i just vouched for his character and work ethic
8111863 he was a strong player but he benches 510 now and thats off the charts but i was really surprised by his quickness he was a lot quicker than i remembered at sc his lower body strength and his flexibility was better than i remembered
8111864 im smarter than when he first got ahold of me and i was kind of raw ive grown up an awful lot since he last coached me i think his perceptions of me are changing that he realizes that im not 17 anymore and that ive been doing this for a while
8111865 we got sed and bobby and they give us a lot of depth and versatility and were excited about that and coach orgeron is a pass rushing coach so hes teaching us a lot more stuff and weve had a lot more pressure in these recent practices than we had in years before
8111866 very explosive smart player very coachable very nice guy we think hes going to have a big year
8111867 i see a very talented player a very athletic guy
8111868 he has a great attitude a great personality the guy just comes in and wants to go to work he can play the one technique nose tackle or the three technique upfield tackle he has the ability to do both and hes strong enough to do both and i just see great things coming from him
8111869 but sometimes its just weird that your career comes full circle
8111870 he brings us a guy who is still very creative
8111871 hes a great pass receiver and a guy we still think is a heck of a runner
8111872 all i know is i am going to touch the football
8111873 one of the things i wanted when atlanta released me is to be involved this is a fresh start and coach gruden wants to get me involved in both facets the running game and the passing game
8111874 so were really happy to have him back in tampa
8111875 but you can be a good person and help people better themselves in your own way
8111876 kyle anyone can buy an expensive wine the trick is in buying an inexpensive wine that tastes like its expensive
8111877 l o tem comida pronta na geladeira depois que tomar banho coloque a toalha dentro da m quina deus te aben oe estou rezando muito para seu cd ser muito muito bom estou com voc nesta luta e vamos chegar l beijo maria antonia
8111878 it was a speech that said what shes been fighting for is the same that barack has been fighting for incredible i love that woman
8111879 as a young latina most people may not think of me as a person they would go to in search of answers
8111880 told her supporters exactly what they needed and told them to support
8111881 i liked that she was enthusiastic and clearly established the difference between obama and john mccain for those who are threatening to vote for mccain
8111882 im honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud suporter of barack obama
8111883 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8111884 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8111885 i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation
8111886 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8111887 clearly abu dhabi is a central location theres so much construction going on there
8111888 we believe that its beneficial to us in helping protect this city to have officers embedded with their law enforcement authorities there
8111889 though bathing helps us to relax and make us forget every day s stress and tension nonetheless it seems to me that something is missing if for sofas or other pieces of furniture variations are infinite when it comes to the bathtub there is not so much to choose about
8111890 it would be great if we could keep cars out of all parks
8111891 which may or may not be able to handle it
8111892 i dont know about prospect park but its certainly something we should look at
8111893 these discrepancies have existed for years and it is virtually impossible to untangle these records some of which are hand written receipts from the courts
8111894 the city must pursue a long term solution to replace its outdated accounting system and tighten controls over these funds
8111895 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8111896 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8111897 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8111898 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8111899 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8111900 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8111901 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8111902 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8111903 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8111904 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8111905 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8111906 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8111907 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8111908 if the proposal by the port authority is in fact discouraging open access to the airports the port authority may no longer be eligible for faa grants or payments under existing grants until the matter is resolved
8111909 we would prefer that calmer heads prevail but we are prepared to go to court
8111910 the building would allow the dsny to vacate existing facilities that are within the grounds of the hudson river park dsny currently fuels other city agency vehicles at all of our facilities citywide as long as refueling doesnt interfere with department operational needs requirements
8111911 we are already burdened with the one district garage here the ups facility that has 150 trucks the holland tunnel and the maintenance trucks that are on pier 40 on top of that congestion and pollution you are going to give us two more district garages with a 30 000 gallon fuel dump its insanity
8111912 were suspecting that bayer submitted flawed studies to play down the risks of pesticide residues in treated plants
8111913 bayers management has to be called to account since the risks have now been known for more than 10 years
8111914 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8111915 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8111916 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8111917 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8111918 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8111919 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8111920 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8111921 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8111922 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8111923 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8111924 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8111925 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8111926 were pursuing those lines of inquiry and to anticipate when charges will be laid at this stage is a little bit presumptuous
8111927 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8111928 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8111929 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8111930 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8111931 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8111932 if i didnt define myself for myself id be crunched into other peoples definitions of me and eaten alive
8111933 the thing that i want to hear first is that she is satisfied on behalf of us and those who sent us that the platform reflects her policy priorities if that has been improved since she campaigned then that would be a good message
8111934 remind people of why barack obama is much better than john mccain for anyone who supported her
8111935 shes going to have to help people remember what the elections about it wasnt about hillary it was about policies
8111936 thanks a lot and we need to move on to become a united party
8111937 i think we are going to hear that theme again loudly clearly and in a heartfelt way
8111938 i want her to set the tone and the future for women for our daughters for everyone for this country shes going to give us direction shes going to give us enthusiasm shes going to make sure we are a united party because this is her moment this is our moment and this is our opportunity
8111939 the same message she spoke to us at the breakfast on monday when she talked about uniting people and making sure that all of us have the same plan and i think she could do that
8111940 i know hillary for an awful long time and i think she could do that
8111941 i have not made a firm decision ive been a lifelong democrat since bobby kennedy was around ive voted straight democratic its going to be a pretty big decision
8111942 so im going to make my decision that im an american first im going to vote for whoever is the best president
8111943 could ever make me change my mind if hillary isnt the candidate to be nominated i will vote for john mccain
8111944 its true the enemy of my enemy is my friend and it seems like a lot of hillarys voters dont want to vote for barack obama so they come over to the mccain campaign
8111945 id rather vote mccain because hes the least worst of the two because at least i know what he stands on i was in search of a candidate who i could respect and support at least i know mccain respects our country
8111946 we have reconciled our minds to that but right now we want to make sure shes on the roll call she gets her due for all the work and hardship she went through she did get the popular vote she deserves to be on the roll call
8111947 mccain is too conservative hes too right wing similar tactics as bush similar policies and i dont think things are going to change enough with mccain hes going to be pretty close to what weve already had
8111948 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8111949 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8111950 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8111951 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8111952 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8111953 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8111954 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8111955 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8111956 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8111957 i dont like it i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please
8111958 its happened thousands of times thats part of the game
8111959 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8111960 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8111961 the euro had a similar move this morning he said
8111962 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point
8111963 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8111964 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp he said
8111965 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers
8111966 the stock routes are managed at the moment by 47 rural lands protection boards which look after them for biodiversity values and things like that

8112362 when the goal is the defense of the homeland there is no difference between man and woman
8112363 this elderly palestinian woman named fatima al najjar led womens demonstrations at the entrance to the town of beit hanoun in the winter of 2006 calling upon the occupation to leave her town and stop the killing and destruction but despite her advanced age she decided to take a different path
8112364 i sacrifice myself for the sake of allah the homeland and al aqsa i ask allah to accept my sacrifice
8112365 fatima al najjar blew herself up near several soldiers of the occupation thus joining the many palestinian women before her who chose martyrdom over a life of humiliation ayat al akhras hanadi jaradat and rim al riyashi who left her two children behind and decided to blow herself up at the beit hanoun crossing in northern gaza
8112366 when the goal is the defense of the homeland there is no difference between man and woman here the women train and learn how to confront the enemy which plundered the land and besieged their people dozens of young palestinian women undergo training every year university students mothers and working women they know that their role in the conflict is not restricted to nursing the sick and caring for the children and that what they are doing here might just change the equation
8112367 the mothers and daughters of palestine believe that death for the sake of a free palestine is a cheap price to pay compared to a life of humiliation under the boots of the occupation
8112368 this young woman who calls herself lover of al quds has set out more than once on combat operations some of which were successful and others not but she is determined to continue
8112369 this is the belt we wear around our waists so that we can detonate ourselves at the push of a button this is a safety button and so is this we wont explode unless we press this button when god instills the will in our hearts our strength lies not in the body but in the heart if the heart so desires and we are inspired by god to set out every female martyrdom seeker is inspired by allah
8112370 lover of al quds is about to be married but she has told her fianc if my land calls me i will respond to the call she will not sit at home awaiting the soldiers of the occupation instead she will go out to confront them wearing her explosives belt with which she never parts
8112371 even if the jews come on my wedding day i will go out to confront them in my wedding gown nothing will stop me from committing martyrdom i have given up all my dreams and aspirations to become a martyrdom seeker i have lived an ordinary life i have lots of free time i go in and out i draw just like any other girl but when it is the will of allah that we become martyrs i will cast all this aside
8112372 every created soul has his place written for him either in paradise or in the hell fire his happy or miserable fate is predetermined for him
8112373 those of the right hand how happy will be those of the right hand those of the left hand how unhappy will be those of the left hand who will be honored in the garden of bliss a number of the earlier peoples and a few of the later ages on couches wrought of gold reclining face to face youth of never ending bloom will pass round cups and decanters full of sparkling wine they shall not be affected with headache thereby nor shall they get exhausted and such fruits as they fancy bird meats that they relish and companions pure and beautiful with big eyes like pearls within their shells as a reward
8112374 unending and unforbidden exalted beds and maidens incomparable we have formed them in a distinctive fashion and made them virgins loving companions matched in age for the sake of those of the right hand
8112375 but those of the left hand how unhappy those of the left hand they will be in the scorching hot wind and boiling water under the shadow of thick black smoke neither cool nor agreeable they will be gathered together on a certain day which is predetermined then you the erring and the deniers will eat zaqqoom fill your bellies with it and drink scalding water lapping it up like female camels raging of thirst and diseased such will be their entertainment their welcome on the day of doom the welcome of boiling water and the entertainment of roasting in hell this is indeed the ultimate truth

8112393 let us be clear about what has happened in recent years the united states has been providing military aid and advice to an increasingly militaristic georgia whose military budget has increased 30 fold since 2003 much to the chagrin i am sure of the georgian taxpayer us intelligence services played a fundamental role in the 2004 election of its pro western president mikheil saakashvili who in turn has been aggressively courting georgian membership in nato none of these developments have been exactly welcomed by the russians who share a huge border with georgia and run important natural gas pipelines through the region to understand why americans should consider how the us government would react if say texas declared its independence and received massive amounts of military aid and advice from the russians all while the texas president feted his russian counterpart at state dinners in austin and promoted texan membership in a post cold war warsaw pact that had already expanded greatly in the previous 15 years throw into the volatile mix the region of south ossetia which i admit to never having heard of before friday frankly its name reminds me of a miami avenue it is a region within georgia that has long resisted consolidation by the georgian state preferring to secede from it as georgia seceded from russia over the years georgia objected to south ossetias right to self government and while much of the worlds attention was on olympic opening ceremonies in beijing the georgian government the russian government caught unawares objected and so we have the tragic situation that is playing itself out today

8112622 we as a community are increasingly wrapping our children in cotton wool because more and more parents are complaining when their children suffer even minor injuries

8112629 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8112630 i know some will resist these changes he said today
8112631 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8112632 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8112633 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8112634 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8112635 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8112636 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said

8112641 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8112642 we originally were approached in late november and early december and we decided to take the job because the father had actually taken the kids to a war zone
8112643 there was a kitty we used for expenses there were five to six team members but in the end i came home with a six figure debt
8112644 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8112645 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8112646 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier
8112647 there was not a whole lot said she put them directly in a vehicle drove out changed vehicles she talked to the girls in the back and they dropped them off to beirut

8112660 the euro had a similar move this morning he said
8112661 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point
8112662 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8112663 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp he said
8112664 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers
8112665 his words were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8112666 i rang the treasurer and he flatly denies it absolutely not true

8112668 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant

8112671 the remaining four parts will become available in the next few weeks
8112672 what they should do is remove two rows of seats in the right field stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in left field 12 feet
8112673 that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the wall 8 feet and end up in the first row
8112674 and they should raise the wall to the same height in center to eliminate home runs that barely clear the wall and land in the grass
8112675 they should put wind screens up in that gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and center
8112676 im not bitching about this because of my record 4 13 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs
8112677 how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8112678 its ok with me as long as it doesnt take too long

8112692 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission
8112693 we reject that this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our mastheads will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality andexcellence
8112694 you would expect them to say they can maintain quality
8112695 time will tell but you will not find many editors who have figured out how you can lose several hundred staff and keep up the quality without a magic potion
8112696 i was responsible for starting a lot of these sections at a time when the smh had no sections at all
8112697 but the newspapers have gone far too far down the lifestyle track they have done it because they believe these sections command benefits in additional advertising
8112698 after fuelling growth in these sections for two decades it would now be not a bad thing at all if the reduction in costs came from cuts to lifestyle
8112699 what those of us who care about journalism say is that there should be less of this death by a thousand cuts and a deeper analysis and reinvention
8112700 we dont manufacture widgets here or car tyres we responsibly provide information to people
8112701 the point we make is that quality depends on individual journalists and the teams of journalists they put together they seem to want to actively break up the teams and the esprit de corps
8112702 management simply doesnt value quality and this new round of redundancies is another example of it
8112703 you cant expect quality wont be affected when you take out so many
8112704 the people likely to go are the most experienced and valued journalists whom fairfax sees as the most expensive newspapers all over the world are struggling and the ones that are doing better are the ones who are investing in their staff
8112705 we must tell people what they want to know and even more important what they might not want to know about war politics economics schools corruption and the thoughts and deeds of those who lead us we need to tell readers more about barack obama and less about britney spears
8112706 if you look at readership and circulation trends over the last few years newspapers with markets that are very clearly defined very targeted are still growing
8112707 this includes regional dailies like the geelong advertiser and townsville daily bulletin or the gold coast bulletin the national daily the australian its a serious political newspaper were still growing i think the fin is holding on better than the smh and the age it knows its market it is a business newspaper but its those papers that are trying to be all things to all people in the capital cities that are struggling
8112708 its instructive that management at fairfax sees that their core business is in fact lifestyle journalism because lifestyle journalism is just as vulnerable to the internet as classifieds were
8112709 theres not much in lifestyle journalism that you cant get provided easily online and its very cheap for internet providers
8112710 the stock routes are managed at the moment by 47 rural lands protection boards which look after them for biodiversity values and things like that
8112711 a review has recommended to the nsw government that travelling stock routes should be ceded back to the department of lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention which means they have to be profitable
8112712 this means the department of lands can do whatever they see fit with their routes they can lease them or sell them or do whatever they like
8112713 the drovers and environmentalists agree that the network should stay connected and not as bits and pieces of land that all have different values with different developments on them
8112714 jesus christ the liberator of mankind is the everlasting and ever flowing source of all the good things that come to us from the infinite bounty of god so that he who has once saved the world is he who will save it throughout all ages
8112715 barack obama has consistently in this campaign talked about more and more spending as a senator he has proposed a billion dollars of earmark spending for his home state
8112716 john mccain on the other hand has proposed time and again reigning in excessive spending and pulling back on unnecessary pork barrel accounts

8112740 the tac is moving to geelong in january 2009 and paul has indicated to the board he wont be seeking a renewal of his contract mr reed said
8112741 people will always speculate about a departure of this nature but the reality is his contract was due to expire in may and given our move to geelong it was more appropriate to transition to a new ceo ahead of time
8112742 theres been two letters that have gone to them in recent months mr reed said
8112743 the first one highlighted a new procedure that bills had to be accompanied by surgical notes and last month we wrote to them saying they may also be asked to complete a self assessment audit
8112744 they may be sent a copy of their bill asking them to confirm certain details within the bill
8112745 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8112746 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8112747 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8112748 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8112749 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8112750 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8112751 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8112752 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8112753 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8112754 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8112755 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8112756 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8112757 were pursuing those lines of inquiry and to anticipate when charges will be laid at this stage is a little bit presumptuous

8112771 in the past we had pursued adoption through santa clara county
8112772 it was very hard to get our foot in the door
8112773 will act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act
8112774 if we find that there was retaliation we do something about it
8112775 this decision shouldnt deter people from filing whistle blower complaints because they will be investigated by the university
8112776 it just seems like such an inherent conflict of interest
8112777 what possible rationale is there for exempting the university of california from whistle blower
8112778 the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws and not of men
8112779 has many different meanings but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state such as a president serving for a limited term in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a the head of state even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected founding fathers of the united states rarely praised and often criticized democracy which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy

8112790 but how do we really capture the essence of the fairgrounds and what it could be for thousands and thousands of families i dont think weve really cracked that nut
8112791 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8112792 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership

8112798 you look back on the primaries and you see how it happened youre still uncertain that hell go all the way but youre euphoric that hes come this far
8112799 it was so bad that they shut the schools down two years later rather than allow blacks in as a result of brown vs board of education
8112800 a student once asked me how come a woman has never been elected president
8112801 now we can say a woman came really close but maybe well be able to say that an african american man was elected president in the words of the poet langston hughes it will no longer be a dream deferred

8112809 if we find that there was retaliation we do something about it
8112810 this decision shouldnt deter people from filing whistle blower complaints because they will be investigated by the university
8112811 it just seems like such an inherent conflict of interest
8112812 what possible rationale is there for exempting the university of california from whistle blower

8112843 the potential of the national timber industry is no less than that of the oil iron and steel industries
8112844 today the u s is overly reliant on canadian imports to meet its lumber needs we are reaching out to you to correct this problem and we are looking to russia to add equilibrium to our market for this essential commodity for the home building industry
8112845 the ability to produce higher quality products combined with the superior qualities of russian fine grained pine larch and spruce logs virtually guarantees russian log and lumber exporters excellent selling opportunities to buyers throughout western europe and asian markets especially china and japan
8112846 all this shows that the government is pursuing a consistent policy aimed to create conditions for effective development of the russian processing industry

8112848 the stock routes are managed at the moment by 47 rural lands protection boards which look after them for biodiversity values and things like that
8112849 a review has recommended to the nsw government that travelling stock routes should be ceded back to the department of lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention which means they have to be profitable
8112850 this means the department of lands can do whatever they see fit with their routes they can lease them or sell them or do whatever they like
8112851 the drovers and environmentalists agree that the network should stay connected and not as bits and pieces of land that all have different values with different developments on them
8112852 his words were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8112853 i rang the treasurer and he flatly denies it absolutely not true
8112854 it was a question asked of him at a branch meeting about the proceeds and the treasurer made the point that if the electricity reform doesnt proceed there is no other additional infrastructure package for anyone
8112855 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8112856 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8112857 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8112858 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8112859 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8112860 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8112861 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8112862 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8112863 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8112864 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8112865 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8112866 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8112867 were pursuing those lines of inquiry and to anticipate when charges will be laid at this stage is a little bit presumptuous
8112868 we originally were approached in late november and early december and we decided to take the job because the father had actually taken the kids to a war zone
8112869 there was a kitty we used for expenses there were five to six team members but in the end i came home with a six figure debt
8112870 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8112871 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8112872 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier
8112873 there was not a whole lot said she put them directly in a vehicle drove out changed vehicles she talked to the girls in the back and they dropped them off to beirut
8112874 the interrogation involved physical abuse which is known as attention slapping which is a form of torture

8112877 the euro had a similar move this morning he said

8112879 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8112880 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp he said
8112881 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers

8112883 defendants intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach

8112893 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
8112894 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8112895 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking eveidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the are from which pershmerga have just withdrawn

8112898 prime minister nouri malikis negotiators are also bogged down in talks over a long term security agreement with the united states despite a december deadline looming for a deal the shiite led government has also initiated a crackdown on leaders and members of the u s funded sons of iraq movement which includes many former insurgents who allied themselves with america in 2007 to fight al qaeda in iraq since may iraqi security forces have started arresting sunni fighters leaders from the sons of iraq have warned that the measures could drive some of their men back to fighting the government
8112899 fixed deadline for the departure of all u s troops troops from iraq
8112900 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8112901 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8112902 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8112903 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only

8112908 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative

8113002 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8113003 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise

8113048 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8113049 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8113050 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8113051 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8113052 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8113053 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8113054 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8113055 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8113056 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale

8113073 youre going to do just fine on your own you dont need government at all
8113074 not only do we understand heres what were going to do for you
8113075 how do we get our country on the right path
8113076 ok weve heard the rhetoric which of these two gentlemen are going to actually have the policies to help my life
8113077 which of the two are going to help my kid afford the resources to go to college or find a way to have an energy policy that actually lowers gas prices or deals with the concern about whether you know in the small towns that somebodys got to leave their hometown to find a world class job
8113078 for me its all about legacy i wish that there were 48 hours in each day so that i had the stamina and time to expedite all of my ideas accordingly i receive credit for my accomplishments but i tend to think that im just getting started i prefer to move under the radar i stay away from negativity and never stop for anyone in my heart im a product of the culture im not fabricated or premeditated ive been through a lot if i was to ever slow down it would be purely by choice while other individuals are talking drinking smoking or focusing on women im in my own space striving towards a higher plateau we must preserve our culture as djs entertainers enthusiasts purists supporters and so forth actions speak louder than words the time is now

8113080 the most important barrel is the one we dont use
8113081 what we have been able to glean is that the journalists the canadian the australian and the somali are unharmed they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv
8113082 i cant say more than that you can understand that the group may be afraid of a possible armed mission to rescue the journalists
8113083 but the way things have gone in somalia from what we know and from what weve seen in the past thats not necessarily a bad thing that theres been no demand yet
8113084 in the case of some italian aid workers kidnapped a while ago in somalia it took seven to 10 days before any contact was made so you see were still early on
8113085 somalia is a dangerous place there are a lot of various factions and many of them have guns its a confusing place

8113090 it was said that the first george bush was born on third base and thought he hit a triple well with the economy he inherited george w bush was elected on third base and then stole second
8113091 its fitting that john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities next week because these days theyre hard to tell apart
8113092 john mccain votes with bush over 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8113093 you post a lie it is proven 100 false you move the goalposts and post yet another lie and it continues on around till were back to the original lie as if it will somehow become true if its re iterated again the same misquotes over and over again the same hindsight bias appeals to authority etc

8113118 when i was young i never had air conditioning so i dont think i missed it

8113120 induced a major population shift within the country that eventually led to the electoral college defeats of the democratic presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004
8113121 a place like houston could only be tolerable with air conditioning
8113122 the end of the long hot summer the air conditioner and southern culture
8113123 we are frequently told that the riviera or southern california has an ideal climate
8113124 for most people the really essential thing in life is the ordinary work of every day hence they are the ones which people will eventually choose in the largest numbers
8113125 if i could figure out a way to box up this bracing northern air i could make millions and destroy the economy of upstate new york
8113126 i guess you need air conditioning when you get older
8113127 electricitys really gone up but im going to keep it as long as i can
8113128 we have seen a rapid growth in the demand for information about search marketing and we re pleased to be able to provide quality content for our audience of search marketers

8113130 our aim is to provide content in a range of formats that educate and enable marketers to work better smarter in search and internet marketing
8113131 im going to have him in the lineup pretty much everyday
8113132 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8113133 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports
8113134 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8113135 if democrats are telling us hes not ready to be president of the united states we better listen

8113141 the speech was too good it just proves that she should have been the presidential vice presidential nominee
8113142 if you have a job with the oil companies then you deserve to lose it no sympathy
8113143 shes just another partisan democrat theyre all the same i pay no attention
8113144 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8113148 with a little bit of exercise every day people can really get their lives back
8113149 maybe a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy and then reconstruction for example those muscles are so tight and weak exercise can help her relearn something as simple as picking up a bag of groceries and putting them on the top shelf in the kitchen and it can give her back the energy and endurance she needs to take the kids to school
8113150 but these patients also usually have a heightened awareness about taking care of their bodies now
8113151 i like to recruit them early during or right after treatment and capitalize on that awareness they know theyve got a second chance and they want to do it right
8113152 ensuite je me suis enfuie je me suis r fugi e quelques minutes chez un voisin
8113153 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8113154 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8113155 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8113156 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8113157 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8113158 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8113159 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people
8113160 you cant avoid that comparison youve got one candidate with a lot of experience and one with virtually no experience
8113161 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8113162 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be
8113163 i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8113164 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8113165 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8113166 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8113167 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8113168 just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husbands administration
8113169 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8113170 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8113171 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8113172 were taking a stand and not backing down its we the people not we the dnc we are standing up for what is right i know in my heart

8113176 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8113177 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8113178 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8113179 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect

8113189 i started getting hit in the head with the gun and then somebody said he is bleeding
8113190 and when i looked i looked into the barrel of a gun and i tried to run away
8113191 he suffered blows to the head with a police issued baton and a police issued gun
8113192 and he was threatened at gunpoint by these police officers
8113193 theyve been suspended and their weapons have been taken away from them and the investigation continues

8113207 kindergarteners tend to touch a lot of things so as they touch they touch each other they spread germs they get sick easily
8113208 so a child who is an infant has one certain type of immune system that changes where if they receive vaccines as an infant that immune system is strong that over time can wane it can decrease so by the time they are 10 or 11 years old in the sixth or seventh grade that immunity may decrease and that may be a time they may need to be boosted
8113209 some of the outbreaks last week that were reported it was clear in the data that was presented that a lot of that was due to the fact that parents were holding back on giving their children the first or the second measles shot
8113210 so again clear evidence that there is a problem when we hold back on the vaccines and we start seeing outbreaks so is it fair to really put everybody at risk i would argue that it is not
8113211 when you see the season it was important to these guys and the things that are going on in the show that they get in touch with where they came from

8113214 there are a lot of big fans of the show in queens and its nice
8113215 when we were casting it it was essential that we found real new yorkers to have that real feel

8113229 there is only one question in this race which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8113230 in 2007 he voted with the bush administration 95 percent of the time only one candidate in the race offers the change we need to restore the promise of america a person of integrity honesty and love for his country barack obama
8113231 hopefully out of this there will be hundreds of women who will take a stand and say yes i can
8113232 i just think thats what our policy is all about inclusion and honoring that inclusion
8113233 and having the leaders of our party step up to the plate and pave that road for other women to get to the top and be in public service and be in public life i just think its a tremendous tribute

8113482 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than

8113488 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8113489 i still cannot see an easy end to the turbulence
8113490 it might take days or months until everything reaches the point where violence erupts
8113491 even after practice i look at my phone gore said
8113492 im dealing with it i will never get over it he said but everything else has him revved up for 08
8113493 we have a new leader man a new leader on the ship gore said of martz
8113494 when he stands up in the room and you hear him talk you know that he knows what hes talking about everything is going to change this year
8113495 it had to take the whole half to get across the 50 yard line gore recalled
8113496 even when we played chicago you saw other guys guys you never heard of getting open and making good plays thats a big thing
8113497 any time you can take somebody like frank and put him out on the perimeter or get him one on one with someone that is what you want martz said
8113498 you want to put frank in an environment where he can get the ball away from the pack because his open field running is pretty special
8113499 no matter what you did in this league coach martz can still make you feel like you have to prove yourself gore said
8113500 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8113501 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our candidate
8113502 i dont think theres been any quarterback in this league that hasnt had ups and downs
8113503 theres going to be better days you have to continue to come to work with the right attitude and get better because if you dont i think thats how things tend to spiral down
8113504 i think its too easy to get negative to get down and im not going to do that
8113505 just going to take a different approach to this im still young i have to use this time to continue to grow
8113506 i certainly never did have the biggest ego you know its part of the game
8113507 im not thinking about that right now when that time comes in the off season or something well deal with it
8113508 but right now taking on this new role is what it is prepare every day and be ready to go
8113509 weve had zero discussions about alex not being on this football team
8113510 you make a lot of money too and theyre not talking about getting rid of you are they
8113511 you need quarterbacks to win games not just one you need a number of them
8113512 and i have confidence in all three of the guys itd make me nervous to lose him

8113516 most of us in our lifetime didnt think we would have a woman run for president who was actually qualified and capable of winning i think for respect shes earned that roll call vote
8113517 i dont believe that i think theyre going to get on the obama train
8113518 really wanted to see the first woman president of the united states and i just couldnt imagine a better one than her she is so intelligent and at the same time so warm
8113519 ive waited for years for this opportunity and im not going to miss it
8113520 hillary is not going to let anyone mistreat her running for president is tough and she hung in there tough and im proud of her
8113521 but for the staunch hillary supporters they will be voting not pro obama but anti mccain she said if thats what it takes to elect a democrat to the white house thats fine
8113522 for older women this whole series reignited every bad memory that they had of how they were treated as they broke into professions
8113523 you talk to anybody 50 or older it just reminded them of all the tough fights that theyve had as a woman
8113524 when you have deep feelings like that and its very personal and sort of juxtaposed onto a candidate its hard to say its ok and i am 100 percent behind
8113525 oh our first musical was about a songwriter who was suicidal takes place

8113528 now jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to ophir for gold but they never set sail they were wrecked at ezion geber
8113529 you adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward god anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god
8113530 like jehoshaphat we may be precious in the lords sight although our schemes end in disappointment
8113531 do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of
8113532 wheel around and get me out of the fighting ive been wounded
8113533 that is why it drives me crazy when christians use the word
8113534 this seemed to be pure chance it was a bow at random but it struck as if it were a sin seeking missile god orchestrated the unintended actions of man to result in an exercise of his judgment
8113535 it was obvious that god was guiding that arrow and ahabs self will ended in his untimely death
8113536 this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
8113537 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car

8113539 be as original as possible and to come up with some cool sexy cutting edge themes and music
8113540 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
8113541 psalm 37 4 niv it doesnt say that if we delight ourselves in the lord if we live our lives for him and for his purposes he will make us miserable
8113542 god will choose for you what you would choose for yourself if you had enough sense to choose it
8113543 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
8113544 since he did not spare even his own son for us but gave him up for us all wont he also surely give us everything else
8113545 the new school year also means that research via wikipedia is going to be on the rise
8113546 a new school year is about to start and students nationwide will be clamoring for ways to keep up with their school work

8113549 speaking from my own religious tradition in this christmas season 2 000 years ago a homeless woman gave birth to a homeless child in a manger because the inn was full

8113555 gore smiled and admitted that he too has trouble turning on a computer let alone using one
8113556 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8113557 he drank a lot of iced tea during meetings which could have necessitated a restroom break
8113558 yet your administration is killing our texas eagle this makes us sick
8113559 dear mr and mrs delgadillo thank you for your letter regarding the protection of the texas eagle i appreciate hearing from you i share your view that the urgent problem of species extinction and the conservation of biological diversity should be addressed the first step in saving any plant or animal from extinction is to become aware of and respect the fragile ecosystems that make up our environment again thank you for sharing your thoughts with me i look forward to working with you for the future of our planet
8113560 think free as in freedom no free as in no cost
8113561 some sort of savior whos going to swoop in and make everything better
8113562 for the rest of his life jackson expressed regret over not executing his former running mate as a traitor
8113563 republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child
8113564 kerry said that edwards told him several times watch the news tomorrow im really going to go after bush then kerry would watch the news the next night and edwards was nowhere to be seen
8113565 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic

8113569 now the dwelling of god is with men and he will live with them
8113570 write this down for these words are trustworthy and true
8113571 hombre mata a su mujer madre hija el presunto homicida
8113572 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8113573 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8113574 taken into account the expression of free will by the ossetian and abkhaz peoples
8113575 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8113576 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
8113577 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8113578 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8113579 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
8113580 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
8113581 the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to change the borders of europe by force
8113582 a blatant attempt to legalise the results of ethnic cleansing which russian troops are continuing to commit right now as we speak and that have been committed during the last several years
8113583 throwing out the remaining population destroying the villages killing and raping and looting people
8113584 this is 21st century brutal invasion and 21st century large scale ethnic cleansing
8113585 how can the world allow them to get away with this
8113586 this is an unparalleled challenge by russia of international law and order
8113587 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8113588 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8113589 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
8113590 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
8113591 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
8113592 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
8113593 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
8113594 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
8113595 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
8113596 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
8113597 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
8113598 the number of missiles in the hands of hizbullah has doubled if not tripled and that the range of the missiles has been extended and this has been accomplished with the close assistance of the syrians
8113599 hizbullah by admission of its leaders on several occasions has replenished its military capacity since the 2006 war with israel i therefore remain concerned that this border remains vulnerable to such weapons transfers which would represent serious violations of the resolution and constitute a significant threat to the stability and security of lebanon
8113600 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
8113601 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s
8113602 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology
8113603 syrias bad negotiating position with israel is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
8113604 ready to cooperate with russia in any way that can strengthen its security

8113607 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8113608 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8113609 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

8113619 kalaulah seandainya kaum muslimin tahu apa yang ada di dalam ramadhan niscaya umatku akan berangan angan agar satu tahun ramadhan seluruhnya
8113620 jika haditsnya shahih karena dalam hatiku ada keraguan pada jarir bin ayyub al bajali
8113621 wahai manusia sungguh bulan yang agung twlah menaungi kalian bulan yang didalamnya terdapat suatu malam yang lebih baik dari seribu bulan allah menjadikan puasa pada bulan itu sebagai satu kewajiban dan menjadikan shalat malamnya sebagai amalan sunnah
8113622 sumbernya pada ali bin zaid bin jadan dan dia lemah
8113623 aku mendengar imam ahmad dan beliau menyebutkan riwayat orang orang syam dari zuhair bin muhammad berkata
8113624 hafalannya jelek dan hadits dia dari syam lebih mungkar daripada haditsnya yang berasal dari irak karena jeleknya hafalan dia
8113625 hadits hadits yang mereka riwayatkan dari ahli syam ini tidak membuatku kagum
8113626 barangsiapa yang berbuka puasa satu hari pada bulan ramadhan tanpa ada sebab dan tidak pula karena sakit maka puasa satu tahun pun tidak akan dapat mencukupinya walaupun ia berpuasa pada satu tahun tersebut
8113627 dalam hadits ini ada perselisihan tentang hubaib bin abi tsabit dengan perselisihan yang banyak hingga kesimpulannya ada tiga penyakit idhthirab goncang tidak diketahuinya keadaan abil muthawwas dan diragukan pendengaran bapak beliau dari abu hurairah
8113628 jika khabarnya shahih karena aku tidak mengenal abil muthawwas dan tidak pula bapaknya sehingga hadits ini dhaif juga
8113629 manakala hadir dalam keadaan sehat dan istiqomah konsisten di atas rute perjalanan menuju allah azza wa jalla tergantung pada kumpulnya unsur pendukung hati tersebut kepada allah dan menyalurkannya dengan menghadapkan hati tersebut kepada allah azza wa jalla secara menyeluruh karena kusutnya hati tidak akan sembuh kecuali dengan menghadapkan nya kepada allah azza wa jalla sedangkan makan dan minum dengan berlebih lebihan dan berlebih lebihan dalam bergaul terlalu banyak bicara dan tidur termasuk dari unsur unsur yang menjadikan hati bertambah berantakan kusut dan mencerai beraikan hati di setiap tempat dan hal hal tersebut akan memutuskan perjalanan hati menuju allah atau akan melemahkannya menghalangi dan menghentikannya rahmat allah yang maha perkasa lagi penyayang menghendaki untuk mensyariatkan bagi mereka puasa yang menyebabkan hilangnya kelebihan makan dan minum pada hambanya dan akan membersihkan kecenderungan syahwat pada hati yang mana syahwat tersebut dapat merintangi perjalanan hati menuju allah azza wa jalla dan disyariatkannya itikaf berdasarkan maslahah kebaikan yang akan diperoleh hingga seorang hamba dapat mengambil manfaat dari amalan tersebut baik di dunia maupun di akhirat kelak dan disyariatkannya itikaf bagi mereka yang mana maksudnya serta ruhnya adalah berdiamnya hati kepada allah azza wa jalla dan kumpulnya hati kepada allah berkhalwat dengan nya dan memutuskan segala kesibukan dengan makhluk hanya menyibukkan diri kepada allah semata hingga jadilah meng ingat nya kecintaan dan penghadapan kepadanya sebagai ganti kesedihan duka hati dan betikan betikannya sehingga ia mampu mencurahkan kepada nya dan jadilah keinginan semua kepada nya dan semua betikan betikan hati dengan mengingat nya bertafakur dalam mendapatkan keridhaan dengan sesuatu yang mendekatkan dirinya kepada allah sehingga bermesraan dengan berkhalwat dengan allah sebagai ganti kelembutannya terhadap makhluk yang menyebabkan dia berbuat demikian adalah karena kelembutannya tersebut kepada allah pada hari kesedihan di dalam kubur mankala sudah tidak ada lagi yang berbuat lembut kepadanya dan manakala tidak ada lagi yang membahagiakan dirinya selain daripada nya maka inilah maksud dari itikaf yang agung itu
8113630 wahai rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam sesungguhnya aku ini pernah nadzar pada jaman jahiliyyah dahulu yaitu aku akan beritikaf pada malam hari di masjidil haram
8113631 dan sesungguhnya rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam pernah memasukkan kepalanya kepadaku padahal beliau sedang itikaf di masjid
8113632 nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam berwudlu di dalam masjid dengan wudlu yang ringan
8113633 dahulu nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam tatkala beliau sedang itikaf pada sepuluh hari terakhir di bulan ramadhan aku datang mengunjunginya pada malam hari ketika itu di sisinya ada beberapa isteri beliau sedang bergembira ria maka akupun berbincang sejenak kemudian aku bangun untuk kembali maka beliaupun berkata jangan engkau tergesa gesa sampai aku bisa mengantarmu kemudian beliau berdiri bersamaku untuk mengantarkan aku pulang tempat tinggal shafiyyah yaitu rumah usamah bin zaid sesampainya di samping pintu masjid yang terletak di samping pintu ummu salamah lewatlah dua orang laki laki laki laki dari kalangan anshar dan ketika keduanya melihat nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam maka keduanyapun bergegas kemudian nabi pun bersabda
8113634 sesungguhnya syetan itu menjalar menggoda anak adam pada aliran darahnya dan sesungguhnya aku khawatir akan bersarangnya kejelekan di hati kalian atau beliau berkata sesuatu
8113635 nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam itikaf pada sepuluh hari terakhir pada bulan ramadhan sampai al mewafatkan beliau kemudian isteri isteri beliau itikaf setelah itu
8113636 pada atsar tersebut ada suatu dalil yang menunjukkan atas bolehnya wanita itikaf dan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa hal itu dibatasi dengan catatan adanya izin dari wali wali mereka dan aman dari fitnah berdasarkan dalil dali yang banyak mengenai larangan berkhalwat dan kaidah fiqhiyah
8113637 dan orang orang yang tidak mampu berpuasa hendaknya membayar fidyah dengan memberi makan seorang miskin
8113638 diberi rukhsah keringanan red bagi laki laki dan perempuan yang sudah tua renta yang tidak mampu berpuasa hendaknya memberi makan seorang yang miskin dan tidak ada qadha kemudian dimansukh oleh ayat yang artinya
8113639 kami pernah pada bulan ramadhan bersama rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam barangsiapa yang mau berpuasa maka berpuasalah dan barangsiapa yang mau berbuka maka berbukalah tetapi harus berbuka dengan memberi fidyah kepada seorang miskin hingga turun ayat yang artinya
8113640 telah tetap bagi laki laki dan wanita yang sudah lanjut usia dan tidak mampu berpuasa serta wanita yang hamil dan menyusui juka khawatir akan keadaan keduanya untuk berbuka dan memberi makan orang miskin setiap harinya
8113641 adapun keadaan keadaan puasa rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam saat datang ke madinah menetapkan puasa selama tiga hari setiap bulannya dan puasa asyura sampai kemudian allah mewajibkan puasa ramadhan turunlah ayat
8113642 berbuka dan gantinya memberi makan satu mud gandum setiap harinya kepada seorang miskin
8113643 seorang wanita hamil dan menyusui boleh berbuka dan tidak mengqadha
8113644 berbukalah dan berilah makan orang miskin setiap harinya dan tidak perlu mengqadha sanadnya jayyid
8113645 barangsiapa diantara kalian ada yang sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkan itu pada hari hari yang lain
8113646 dan wajib orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa membayar fidyah yaitu memberi makan seorang miskin
8113647 puasalah kalian karena melihat hilal bulan baru red dan berbukalah karena melihat hilal jika kalian terhalangi awan sempurnakanlah bulan syaban tiga puluh hari
8113648 janganlah kalian puasa hingga melihat hilal jika kalian terhalangi awan hitunglah bulan syaban
8113649 jika datang bulan ramadhan puasalah tiga puluh hari kecuali kalian melihat hilal sebelum hari ketiga puluh
8113650 jangan kalian mendahului ramadhan dengan melakukan puasa satu atau dua hari sebelumnya kecuali seseorang yang telah rutin berpuasa maka berpuasalah
8113651 barangsiapa yang berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan berarti telah durhaka kepada abul qasim
8113652 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya berhajilah kalian karena melihat hilal jika kalian tertutup awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan bulan syaban menjadi tiga puluh hari jika ada dua saksi berpuasalah kalian dan berbukalah
8113653 manusia mencari cari hilal maka aku kabarkan kepada nabi bahwa aku melihatnya maka rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam pun menyuruh manusia berpuasa
8113654 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam memerintahkan kami dengan shadaqah fithri sebelum diturunkannya kewajiban zakat dan tatkala diturunkannya kewajiban zakat beliau tidak memerintahkan kami dan tidak pula melarang kami tetapi kami mengerjakan mengeluarkan zakat fithri
8113655 bahwa pada sanadnya ada rawi yang tidak dikenal196 akan tetapi hadits tersebut mempunyai penguat dan dikeluarkan oleh an nasai 5 49 dan ibnu majah 1 585 dan ahmad 6 6 ibnu khuzaimah 4 81 dan al hakim 1 410 dan al baihaqi 4 159 dari beberapa jalan dan sanadnya shahih dan kalaupun dianggap shahih tidak ada dalil yang menunjukkan atas naskh diahapusnya hadits qais yang menunjukkan wajibnya zakat fithri mungkin rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mencukupkan dengan perintah yang pertama karena turunnya suatu kewajiban tidaklah menggugurkan kewajiban yang lain
8113656 ini tidak menunjukkan hilangnya kewajiban zakat fithri tetapi hanya menunjukkan tambahan dalam jenis ibadah tidak mengharuskan dimansukhknya hukum sebelumnya kedudukan zakat harta sebagaiman kedudukan zakat fithri yaitu berkaitan dengan riqab orang per orang
8113657 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan zakat fithri sebanyak satu gantang kurma atau satu gantang gandum atas hamba dan orang yang merdeka kecil dan besar dari kalangan kaum muslimin
8113658 tidak wajib atas orang yang puasa karena hadits ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhuma
8113659 zakat fithri wajib atas orang yang puasa yang kaya atau orang fakir yang mendapatkan makanan dari dia jika illat diwajibkannya karena pensucian maka seluruh orang yang puasa butuh akan hal itu jika berserikat dalam illat berserikat pula dalam hukum
8113660 pensucian disebutkan untuk menghukumi yang dominan zakat fithri diwajibkan pula atas orang yang tidak berpuasa seperti diketahui keshahihannya atau orang yang masuk islam sesaat sebelum terbenamnya matahari
8113661 kami mengeluarkan zakat pada zaman rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam satu gantang makanan satu gantang gandum satu gantang korma satu gantang susu kering satu gantang anggur kering
8113662 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan atu gantang gandum satu gantang korma dan satu gantang salt
8113663 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam menyuruh kami untuk mengeluarkan zakat ramadhan satu gantang makanan dari anak kecil besar budak dan orang yang merdeka
8113664 barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa tepung akan diterima barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa adonan diterima
8113665 zakat fithri satu gantang makanan barangsiapa yang membawa gandum diterima yang membawa korma diterima yang membawa salt gandum yang tidak berkulit diterima yang membawa anggur kering diterima aku mengira beliau berkata
8113666 dulu makanan kami adalah gandum anggur kering susu yang dikeringkan dan korma
8113667 tunaikanlah satu gantang gandum atau korma untuk dua orang satu gantang dari gandum atas orang merdeka hamba anak kecil atau besar
8113668 timbangan yang teranggap adalah timbangannya ahlu mekah dan kiloan yang teranggap adalah kiloan nya orang madinah
8113669 kami diperintah oleh rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mengeluarkan shadaqah fithri atas anak kecil dan orang tua orang merdeka dan hamba dari orang orang yang membekalinya
8113670 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam zakat fithri sebagai pembersih diri bagi yang berpuasa dari perbuatan sia sia dan perbuatan kotor dan sebagai makanan bagi orang orang miskin
8113671 barangsiapa yang menunaikan zakatnya sebelum shalat maka dia adalah zakat yang diterima dan barangsiapa yang menunaikannya setelah shalat maka dia adalah merupakan shadaqah dari beberapa shadaqah yang ada
8113672 dan makan minumlah hingga terang bagimu benang putih dan benang hitam yaitu fajar kemudian sempurnakanlah puasa itu sampai datang malam
8113673 jika lupa hingga makan dan minum hendaklah menyempurnakan puasanya karena sesungguhnya allah yang memberinya makan dan minum
8113674 allah meletakkan tidak menghukum umatku karena salah atau lupa dan karena dipaksa
8113675 barangsiapa yang terpaksa muntah maka tidak wajib baginya untuk mengqadha puasanya dan barangsiapa muntah dengan sengaja maka wajib baginya mengqadha puasanya
8113676 berdiam beberapa malam dan berbuka di bulan ramadhan ini adalah bukti kurang agamanya
8113677 aku pernah bertanya kepada aisyah mengapa orang haid mengqadha puasa tetapi tidak mengqadha shalat aisyah berkata apakah engkau wanita haruri 1 aku menjawab aku bukan haruri tapi hanya sekedar bertanya aisyah berkata kamipun haidh ketika puasa tetapi kami hanya diperintahkan untuk mengqadha puasa tidak diperintahkan untuk mengqadha shalat
8113678 jima dengan sengaja tidak ada ikhtilaf perbedaan pendapat padanya bahwa hal tersebut membatalkan puasa adapaun jika jima tersebut terjadi karena lupa maka sebagian ahli ilmu menganggapnya sama dengan orang yang makan dan minum dengan tidak sengaja
8113679 menunjukkan bahwa jima membatalkan puasa seperti halnya makan dan minum tidak ada perbedaan pendapat akan hal ini
8113680 sekarang pergaulilah mereka dan carilah apa yang telah ditetapkan allah untuk kalian
8113681 pernah datang seseorang kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian ia berkata ya rasulullah binasalah aku rasulullah bertanya apa yang membuatmu binasa orang itu menjawab aku menjimai istriku di bulan ramadhan di siang hari red rasulullah bersabda apakah kamu mampu memerdekakan seorang budak orang itu menjawb tidak rasulullah bersabda apakah engkau mampu memberi makan enam puluh orang miskin orang itu menjawab tidak rasulullah bersabda duduklah diapun duduk kemudian ada yang mengirim satu wadah korma kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam rasulullah bersabda bersedekahlah orang itu berkata tidak ada di antara dua kampung ini keluarga yang lebih miskin dari kami rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pun tertawa hingga terlihat gigi serinya lalu beliau bersabda ambillah berilah makan keluargamu
8113682 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada suatu malam keluar dan shalat di masjid orang orang pun ikut shalat bersamanya dan mereka memperbincangkan shalat tersebut hingga berkumpullah banyak orang ketika beliau shalat mereka pun ikut shalat bersamanya mereka meperbincangkan lagi hingga bertambah banyaklah penghuni masjid pada malam ketiga rasulullah shallalalhu alaihi wa sallam keluar dan shalat ketika malam keempat masjid tidak mampu menampung jamaah hingga beliau hanya keluar untuk melakukan shalat shubuh
8113683 amma badu sesungguhnya aku mengetahui perbuatan kalian semalam namun aku khawatir diwajibkan atas kalian sehingga kalian tidak mampu mengamalkannya
8113684 aku keluar bersama umar bin al khaththab radhiyallahu anhu suatu malam di bulan ramadhan ke masjid ketika itu manusia berkelompok kelompok 2 ada yang shalat sendirian dan ada yang berjamaah maka umar berkata
8113685 sebaik baik bidah adalah ini orang yang tidur lebih baik dari yang bangun ketika itu manusia shalat di awal malam
8113686 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak pernah shalat malam di bulan ramadhan atau selainnya lebih dari sebelas rakaat
8113687 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menghidupkan malam ramadhan bersama manusia delapan rakaat kemudian witir dikeluarkan oleh ibnu hibban dalam shahihnya 920 thabrani dalam as shagir halaman 108 dan ibnu nasr qiyamul lail halaman 90 sanadnya hasan sebagaimana syahidnya
8113688 umar bin al khaththab menyuruh ubay bin kaab dan tamim ad daari untuk mengimami manusia dengan sebelas rakaat
8113689 ketika itu imam membaca dua ratus ayat hingga kami bersandar bertelekan pada tongkat karena lamanya berdiri kami tidak pulang kecuali ketika furu fajar
8113690 bahwa umar mengumpulkan manusia di bulan ramadhan dengan dua puluh satu rakaat membaca dua ratus ayat selesai ketika awal fajar
8113691 aku punya hutang puasa ramadhan dan tiak bisa mengqadhanya kecuali di bulan syaban
8113692 dalam hadits ini sebagai dalil atas bolehnya mengakhirkan qadha ramadhan secara mutlak baik karena udzur ataupun tidak
8113693 mereka itu bersegera untuk mendapat kebaikan kebaikan dan merekalah orang orang yang segera memperolehnya
8113694 maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada hari hari yang lain
8113695 artnya barangsiapa yang punya hutang puasa ramadhan hendaknya diqadha secara berturut turut tidak boleh memisahnya
8113696 kalau mau boleh dipisah kalau mau boleh juga berturut turut
8113697 barangsiapa yang wafat dan mempunyai hutang puasa nadzar hendaknya diganti oleh walinya
8113698 datang seseorang kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian berkata
8113699 tidak tetapi bersedekahlah untuknya setiap harinya setengah gantang untuk setiap muslim
8113700 jika salah seorang dari kalian sakit di bulan ramadhan kemudian wafat sebelum sempat puasa dibayarkan fidyah dan tidak perlu qadha kalau punya hutang nadzar diqadha oleh walinya
8113701 kalau yang mempuasakannya tiga puluh orang seorangnya berpuasa satu hari diperbolehkan
8113702 para sahabat muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah orang orang yang paling bersegera dalam berbuka dan paling akhir dalam sahur
8113703 berpegang dengan rasul mereka dan menolak semua yang merubah sunnah
8113704 umatku akan senantiasa dalam sunnahku selama mereka tidak menunggu bintang ketika berbuka puasa
8113705 agama ini akan senantiasa menang selama manusia menyegerakan berbuka 1 karena orang orang yahudi dan nasrani mengakhirkannya
8113706 hai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kamu dalam islam secara kaffah
8113707 tiga perkara yang merupakan akhlak para nabi menyegerakan berbuka mengakhirkan sahur dan meletakkan tangan kanan red di atas tangan kiri dalam shalat
8113708 marfu dan mauquf shahih adapaun yang marfu ada perawi yang tidak aku ketahui biografinya
8113709 sesungguhnya telah datang kepadamu seorang rasul dari kaummu sendiri berat terasa olehnya penderitaan olehmu sangat menginginkan keimanan dan keselamatan bagimu amat belas kasihan lagi penyayang terhadap orang orang mukmin
8113710 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berbuka dengan korma basah ruthab jika tidak ada ruthab maka berbuka dengan korma kering tamr jika tidak ada tamr maka minum dengan satu tegukan air
8113711 tiga doa yang dikabulkan doanya orang yang berpuasa doanya orang yang terdhalimi dan doanya musafir
8113712 tiga orang yang tidak akan ditolak doanya orang yang puasa ketika berbuka imam yang adil dan doanya orang yang didhalimi
8113713 sesungguhnya orang yang puasa ketika berbuka memiliki doa yang tidak akan ditolak
8113714 telah hilang dahaga dan telah basah uart urat dan telah ditetapkan pahala insya allah
8113715 barangsiapa yang memberi buka orang yang puasa akan mendapatkan pahala seperti pahalanya orang yang berpuasa tanpa mengurangi pahalanya sedikitpun
8113716 telah makan makanan kalian orang orang bajik dan para malaikat bershalawat mendoakan kebaikan atas kalian orang orang yang berpuasa telah berbuka di sisi kalian
8113717 allahumma ath im man ath amanii wa as qi man saqoonii
8113718 ya allah berilah makan orang yang memberiku makan berilah minum orang yang memberiku minum
8113719 ya allah ampunilah mereka dan rahmatilah berilah barakah pada seluruh rizki yang engkau berikan
8113720 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8113721 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8113722 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8113723 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8113724 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8113725 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8113726 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8113727 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8113728 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8113729 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8113730 while the improvement in new home sales in july is definitely a favorable development it comes on the heels of two consecutive months of significant downward revisions to sales numbers for may and june so we have to keep the latest report in perspective
8113731 nevertheless we are cautiously optimistic that home sales are approaching a bottom and that the newly enacted first time home buyer tax credit will help stimulate sales and provide crucial support for a market turnaround
8113732 he votes with george bush 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8113733 john mccain will continue spending 10 billion dollars a month in iraq
8113734 its time for a president who will bring our jobs back and bring our troops home for the change we need its time for barack obama
8113735 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and a fight we must win together
8113736 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8113737 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons why i support barack obama
8113738 agerandet bara f rv rrar det sp nda l get
8113739 agerandet bara f rv rrar det sp nda l get
8113740 bara en galning kunde s tta s mycket p spel trodde han att ryssland skulle st passivt n r han verf ll den sovande staden tschinvali och m rdade hundratals civila de flesta ryska medborgare
8113741 rysslands agerande bara f rv rrar det sp nda l get och komplicerar diplomatiska f rhandlingar
8113742 barack obama r min kandidat vi r i samma lag
8113743 as long as i intend to return thats my residence
8113744 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
8113745 it was a flat out no to somebody who never gets a no from anybody on anything
8113746 when that happened i thought wow there probably are things i could learn about safety
8113747 i havent been on a bike in years and even when i did it wasnt in traffic
8113748 25 percent five year tax abatement for reynolds amp reynolds construction of a new 15 000 square foot facility at miami valley research park research blvd and county line road
8113749 reynolds amp reynolds plans to hire a minimum of eight new full time equivalent employees
8113750 all acquisition construction and installation will be completed by june 1 2009
8113751 ive never smoked pot and im not a teenage sex addict
8113752 was held for questioning and the decision whether to arrest him will be taken at the end of the probe
8113753 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8113754 gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8113755 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered that the claims
8113756 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8113757 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8113758 theres a lot of animus there because it was so close
8113759 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of ber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8113760 but those things only happen if shes seen as doing the right thing now
8113761 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8113762 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8113763 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8113764 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8113765 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8113766 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8113767 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8113768 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8113769 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8113770 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8113771 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8113772 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8113773 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8113774 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8113775 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8113776 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8113777 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8113778 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8113779 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8113780 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8113781 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8113782 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8113783 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8113784 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8113785 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8113786 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8113787 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8113788 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8113789 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8113790 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8113791 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8113792 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8113793 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8113794 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8113795 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8113796 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8113797 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8113798 not a call to go from right to left but from down to up
8113799 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8113800 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8113801 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8113802 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8113803 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8113804 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8113805 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8113806 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8113807 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8113808 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8113809 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8113810 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8113811 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8113812 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8113813 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8113814 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8113815 i started dogs with bones as an idea for people to share photos of their dogs with bones it was difficult to obtain an isp and hosting service in 77 but i persisted i worked day and night often only sleeping 14 hours a day struggling to perfect my dream
8113816 then one day in 2007 i had an epiphany why not expose dogs to the general public wearing those round plastic protective covers around their head i was struggling for so many years with dogs with bones i was conflicted with the idea of trying to launch an entire new concept what would this new endeavor be called would people accept it would my investors accept it
8113817 then one april afternoon in 2007 while cashing in a coupon at cold stone creamery it came to me
8113818 it took a bit of convincing the shareholders of dwc that this in no way portrays dogs eating ice cream after two failed votes i thought it was all over
8113819 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8113820 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8113821 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8113822 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party for a single purpose
8113823 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8113824 thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up
8113825 anyone who saw michelles speech last night will know that she will be a great first lady for america
8113826 the worst is yet to come in the u s were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
8113827 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds he said
8113828 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8113829 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8113830 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8113831 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8113832 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8113833 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8113834 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8113835 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8113836 because for me this is truly about the future were going to give all of you
8113837 thanks to you the glass ceiling now has about 18 million cracks in it
8113838 i am very proud to introduce my hero and my mother senator hillary rodham clinton
8113839 i am here tonight as a proud supporter of barak obama it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barak the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8113840 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8113841 barak obama is my candidate and he must be our president tonight i ask you to remember what a presidential election is really about
8113842 every day americas greatness is bound up in the american people
8113843 you taught me so much and you made me laugh and yes you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8113844 we want to create a world class education system and make college affordable again
8113845 it wont be easy progress never is but it will be impossible if we dont elect barak obama
8113846 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8113847 man is born free and everywhere he is in chains
8113848 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8113849 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8113850 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8113851 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8113852 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8113853 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8113854 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8113855 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8113856 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8113857 its a great community to live in said gerald moore who with brother joel worked at the mill owned by parents jerry and elsie
8113858 we put the date on the saw blade so jerry could hang it up in the new mill said jaime bell one of the organizers of the rebuild effort
8113859 and who knows 50 years from now these kids might be in charge
8113860 i went to brehauts murray harbour for breakfast on tuesday and two people handed me donations because they couldnt make the concert the night before said bell
8113861 im getting people mailing donations in and calling on where to send some money its just fantastic
8113862 lots of people just came and gave and had to leave said bell a member of the celtic ladies
8113863 when it came time for us to play i just couldnt believe how packed it was
8113864 this survey is recognition that tobacco control programs and legislation are making a difference
8113865 however the fight against tobacco is not over there is still much to do and with the prospective amendments to the smoke free places act we are optimistic p e i s smoking rates will continue to drop
8113866 when p e i s new tobacco legislation is implemented p e i will once again be at the forefront of the country in developing smoke free public places and workplaces
8113867 to maintain this level and to make sure there is no future increase it is important to monitor trends in tobacco products that may be appeal to youth and young adults including flavoured cigarillos and chewing tobacco
8113868 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8113869 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8113870 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8113871 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8113872 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8113873 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8113874 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8113875 senior management has been talking with a wide array of possible investors this week

8113877 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8113878 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8113879 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8113880 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8113881 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8113882 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8113883 the product thats in question was some of the roast beef products on the extended maple leaf recall list atlantic prepared foods general manager robert moore told the guardian
8113884 it was in our production on a certain day which was july 29 moore said
8113885 we do not normally use any products from 97 b but it was one of those fluke things that we would have bought any products different than what we normally use and it just happened to be part of the extended list from the maple leaf recall
8113886 we took them all off the shelf as precaution because theres a possible chance that other varieties of roast beef could have been in contact with the roast beef that we used for irving and sub delicious moore said
8113887 we have removed them from the shelves and have replaced them with new products that are not part of that plant number at all which we normally dont have in our plant anyway
8113888 were seeing some new curriculum in some social studies courses that is long overdue theres new curriculum in law new curriculum in trades and its a welcome change
8113889 we do have a lot of upgrades in technology this year you have to keep upgrading technology to keep students interested were trying to keep up with the pace
8113890 i was hoping for something like this dolan said tuesday as details of the 13th annual prince edward island international shellfish festival were unveiled
8113891 never in my wildest dreams did i ever think we were going to get here
8113892 we have fantastic mussels fantastic oysters and what we are doing is we are showcasing them said dolan
8113893 it is a celebration of the harvest its farming in a different way its farming from the water
8113894 there is not a better spot than right here on prince edward island to get shellfish said ghiz
8113895 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8113896 for the long term and for the good of the program this is in our best interest
8113897 tyrod wanted to redshirt and we are trying to do what is in his best interest for him
8113898 i wanted this to be settled and that is the way i like things to be now we know what direction we will be going in this season
8113899 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8113900 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8113901 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that
8113902 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8113903 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8113904 it seems like they are definitely on an uphill climb towards the top
8113905 they have definitely made progress its a team that i think will be here for a long time and seems to be heading in the right direction to win races
8113906 reed is a highly talented driver with a wealth of experience and accomplishments for a 22 year old
8113907 we believe he has a great future ahead of him here at gillett evernham motorsports he will be a great fit with our drivers sponsors and employees
8113908 i think they believe in me as a driver and that means a lot and i believe in them as a team
8113909 you know any type of breakup like that is not the easiest thing in the world to do for either side
8113910 but i feel like it went fairly well im not too sure how good those types of things can go but i think its ok
8113911 i think everybody kind of tried to pull together and tried to make sure that nobody was pointing fingers or anything like that
8113912 its obviously not a fun process to go through thats for sure having the extra pressure on you
8113913 but at the same time long term wise i feel like this is where i want to be

8113936 for the flexibility i can pay a bit more for the loan
8113937 higher returns relative to the risk they are taking on
8113938 we underwrite loans based on todays market and cash flow
8113939 we dont want to lend on anything we dont want to own
8113940 the development activity has gone from zilch to pervasive across the country
8113941 one of the two or three most ambitious plans around and its the largest
8113942 oh no what if gt someone was offended by it
8113943 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8113944 in four months well have an administration that actually believes in science
8113945 its appropriate that mccain and bush will appear together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8113946 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8113947 the big problem we were always going to have was what we had left in our legs we saw today that when joe public got out ahead of us with the schedule weve had and the travel weve had its been taken out of us certainly were pleased to only lose 2 1 joe public had a couple of chances but we had a couple of chances as well so weve given ourselves a chance
8113948 we knew joe public had good players players we had to keep our eyes on and what we saw tonight was exactly what wed thought wed get
8113949 what worked against us was the amount of time it took to get here we had some injuries as well and had to make some changes so that was against us joe public played well and deserved to win the game but were glad that we have a chance next week
8113950 they played better passed the ball better we knew it was going to be tough the biggest thing for us was that we gave ourselves the chance to tie

8113952 ask not what the internet can do for you ask what you can do for the internet
8113953 be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send
8113954 receiving a new truth is adding a new sense right wrongs no man
8113955 which have burdened all the conflict and hindered all the fight
8113956 we dont have a system here the government does not have a solution
8113957 if we did not have foreigners here i dont think the afghan national army or police would come out of their bases
8113958 if just 20 or 30 police had come round from the side they could have stopped them
8113959 you let them know i am going to the temple everyday and praying for barack obama
8113960 its very exciting and certainly my grandmother and our family members not only in india but in this country are all very excited about the future of our country
8113961 i was very proud to be one of the first elected in california to endorse barack obama i supported him for the us senate and he supported me in my race to become the first indian american district attorney in the country
8113962 and i can tell you that i know very well of his commitment to doing good in terms of his leadership of this country and in particular to the very important aspect of a good democracy which is coalition building
8113963 barack was recently in san francisco at a indian american fund raising reception we hosted for him and he proudly declared to the crowd his status as a desi and talked about the need to have an administration in washington dc and the white house that understands the plight of immigrants coming into the country the need to have an administration and policies that reflect good immigration policies and also that look to leadership in terms of having a good relationship with our international neighbours
8113964 i think indian americans can be very proud of our support of barack obama and electing the next president of the united states who again by his own admission will be a desi
8113965 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
8113966 in the dorm indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
8113967 those are friendships have lasted me for years and continue until this day
8113968 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
8113969 i really think that baracks story is our story and his candidacy is an especially extraordinary milestone and a catalyst for our community
8113970 almost every indian american kid growing up in this country who reads that book has unbelievable moments and glimmers of recognition his struggle for an identity his struggle for values his struggle for finding his place in society
8113971 his america represents what all of us would hope and want our america to be
8113972 in terms of the campaign and its impact on our community what i have been so excited about working with so many of us like ann kalayil and subodh chandra and so many of us whove been involved in his campaign from the very beginning whats been extraordinary about this campaign is they have looked to our community not simply for our pocketbooks
8113973 they didnt ask us to open our wallets they asked us to open our minds and our hearts
8113974 so they really looked at us as a full community one that has policy ideals one that has grassroots involvement and engagement and i think in this campaign is really the first time our community has married all the three levers of influence
8113975 policy thought leadership grassroots and ground up involvement and financial strength
8113976 we have an incredible grassroots movement we have probably one of the earliest and best organised efforts within the campaign in terms of mobilising you
8113977 has a very strong finance committee and we have good fundraising at the moment and then we have key people throughout this campaign in positions of policymaking
8113978 these indian american democrats who belong to the oldest political party in the world are leading the charge to strengthen our party elect our candidates and ensure that we build a government that lives up to the ideals that inspired generations of indian immigrants to make america their home
8113979 perhaps these pages include a future dnc chair perhaps they include the first indian american who will manage a presidential campaign perhaps they include a future democratic president of the united states
8113980 what is certain is that this almanac will only grow over time as more and more indian americans achieve positions of leadership within our party
8113981 that is fundamentally the strength of the democratic party the rise of indian american democrats did not happen by accident
8113982 it is not a fortuitous anomaly it is the direct result of a shared set of values that connect the community and our party
8113983 it is a testament to the ongoing efforts of organisations like the indian american leadership initiative to identify recruit train cultivate and develop the next generation of democratic leaders
8113984 deposited in overseas bank accounts belonging to his family members
8113985 further damage the dpps legitimacy in challenging the ruling party
8113986 as the case goes on people will see that it is not the fault of the party but the individual and people will come back
8113987 the scandal will be a media hype for a couple of weeks but the bottom line is people care about their economic situation
8113988 the biggest and best rock show the world has ever witnessed
8113989 obviously on any creative plans well want general agreement from stakeholders and everything will be signed off by locog
8113990 if my dome experience is anything to go by its not that interesting creative sophisticated ideas were ignored they were actually energetically rejected
8113991 unable to distinguish between volume of activity and quality of activity
8113992 instead of having world class art world class architecture you got installations some of which looked as if they were designed by people whose last job had been to make a stand for british gas at a trades fair in antwerp
8113993 a mixed bag but on the whole the best of the hand over shows i can remember interesting and a little quirky
8113994 london needs to do something that is just smart alecky enough but you dont want to push it so far that it becomes disrespectful to the athletes or the olympic tradition
8113995 it looks like we are slowly starting to dig out of this
8113996 the faa is doing things on the cheap when it comes to technology and infrastructure
8113997 if i have a thought that occurs to me ill fire it off
8113998 sometimes it ends up being the lead of a piece or the notion a piece gets framed around
8113999 theres an element of narcissism and class clownery a wisecrack comes into your head and you want to share it
8114000 enjoying the 60 degree weather before it turns into humid soup followed by thunderstorm
8114001 watching michelle obama walkthru at podium daughter bangs gavel and says my dad
8114002 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8114003 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8114004 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in
8114005 i came across one that was a five bedroom for 1 200 and i just kind of was like well maybe they made a typo
8114006 i dont want to lose another 2 200 when ive lost 5 000 last year i have three kids i need to support
8114007 yes theres a family that lives next door right now
8114008 if it sounds too good to be true its a big no for me thats a big red flag
8114009 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8114010 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8114011 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words

8114041 there is no money to keep the kids in school no money to keep a family warm people are getting desperate and turning to crime making the community more insecure

8114050 the idea of creating tag clouds is not new or unique but the wordle application offers those in schools with a uniquely visual way to view and or analyse some text it is very simple to use and the results are created quickly the style can be changed easily if required and easily saved we used this aspect in the library this week when we made a wordle using a number of lists of banned books the authors the titles and types of books were entered into the text box overwhelmingly the word novel stood out a second wordle on banned authors had william shakespeare and george orwell as the standouts this could form part of a greater discussion about the reason for this and we intend to give the issues of banned books and censorship a wider focus at a later date perhaps as part of social justice week run at our school each year we are also using wordles as the basis for one of the competitions for book week we created wordles of synopses of various well known books taking out any references too unique to the book and printed out copies one of the library staff members had fun playing with the colours and formats we did one for bryan strauchan my story and made it black and white bryan strauchan is a fictional character who plays for a football team that happens to have team colours of black and white another book involving animals was done making the wordle resemble tiger stripes the wordles look great laminated and i will also be putting up digital versions on the library website

8114054 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8114055 if democrats are telling us hes not ready to be president of the united states we better listen
8114056 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8114057 im here to make a few points for the good side
8114058 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8114059 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8114060 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8114061 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8114062 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8114063 a letter of recommendation from a counselor or teacher a recommendation provided by a math or science teacher is preferred
8114064 if that high wasnt there gustav would have probably just moved north right into the atlantic
8114065 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8114066 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8114067 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8114068 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8114069 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8114070 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8114071 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8114072 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8114073 this election comes down to a simple question do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8114074 let big oil determine and even write our national energy policy
8114075 for the last eight years the bush cheney team stonewalled the taxing of oil company profits and prevented efforts to promote alternative energy production and guess who voted with the bush administration 90 percent of the time john mccain
8114076 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8114077 this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit

8114099 just seeing his size and his strength i just kept picturing her trying to get away from him and i was just replaying in my head what she may have gone through
8114100 he just looks like an animal he just looks like an animal
8114101 he was very respectful the whole way back didnt have any trouble
8114102 it was very horrific the way that he raped her as we believe the evidence would show the suspect did this

8114106 im all for outlining acceptable behaviour but i dont see a contract as the right way
8114107 i think we underestimate the ability of kids to contribute eight year old kids are quite savvy
8114108 the fact that a child is eight and is asked to contribute to the definition of rules that they are part of is a good thing
8114109 part of a social contracting experience where kids and the teachers negotiate what rules apply in a classroom
8114110 often the origin of these rules is kids themselves its quite a different regime to what happened previously where teachers said these are the rules and you will follow them or these are the consequences
8114111 its a far more collaborative and i think fairer way its not draconian at all
8114112 thats a fairly young age to have a contract which has punitive components to it youre more likely to get somewhere with that age group if you use carrots as opposed to sticks
8114113 i would think its part of the broader trend across australian schools to make them more collaborative and democratic

8114163 i dont know why the issue is any more complicated than that
8114164 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8114165 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8114166 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8114167 less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged comes first and everyone else come last
8114168 barack and joe will champion the issues we care about they will be there with us
8114169 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus came into office on third base and then he stole second
8114170 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8114171 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8114172 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8114173 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8114174 in the 2008 platform instead theyll go with the proper
8114175 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8114176 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8114177 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies
8114178 and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to
8114179 in an effort to disguise a convention without a message and a candidate without any experience on meaningful energy policy repairing an economy or dangerous international affairs obama supporters are reduced to flimsy attacks
8114180 he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should and he doesnt understand how the policies that he has supported and wants to perpetuate have so terribly misfired
8114181 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8114182 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect
8114183 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus that came into office on third base and then he stole second and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8114184 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home
8114185 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8114186 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8114187 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8114188 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8114189 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8114190 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8114191 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice

8114201 did you vote for me because of me or did you vote for me because of the woman with cancer
8114202 when i heard i had more abnormal cells i thought this is the fourth time i have been told i need to have the same operation now
8114203 once you have them burnt off they should not come back but i was too scared
8114204 the doctors were doing tests for my blood loss but they seemed unclear about what it could be it was then that i was told i must have another operation on the dodgy cells on my cervix they had sent a letter to me ages ago telling that i needed to go in for an operation but i had been too scared to do anything about it

8114236 the one thing im getting in order is my eating ive been thinking about that a lot now that ive started going longer distances im not eating terrible foods but i need more energy the other day i ate chinese food then did a mini mock tri a swim then a bike and a run i could feel the heavy greasy food slooowwwing me down by the end of the workout i was thinking to myself if i ate better id feel better about now and id have more energy so now im working on getting on a good healthy diet today i had a banana before my workout
8114237 i want to teach twins max and emme that there are healthy things that taste good growing up i didnt eat vegetables i didnt know there was brown bread id eat a sugar doughnut then go to school totally sugar buzzed wed eat hamburgers for lunch then rice and beans and meat for dinner rice and beans arent bad but the meat was always fried culturally thats just what my mom was fed and so she fed it to us i want to give my kids the healthy stuff early so they can build on it then have little treats
8114238 gnomes on the other hand are smurf like things with beards that sit with fishing rods in the gardens of people who dont know the meaning of taste
8114239 think of pcs as cats they like shiny things and things that move and they are funny to watch but you can never be completely sure of what theyll do next and sometimes they spaz for no apparent reason
8114240 although the d series is lightweight highly energy efficient and cost competitive with other multi channel products these amplifiers also feature input stages and power supplies designed by bryston these are world class audio products
8114241 these are market segments that have been screaming at us for bryston quality in an affordable multi channel configuration
8114242 the d series is a true hi fi solution in a mostly function first category
8114243 although the entire zone amp product category is separate from our audiophile amplifier designs bryston engineers were able to execute class d products at a very high level
8114244 you should live every day like it would be your last and theres not that many people who do
8114245 its a credit to dave he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
8114246 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8114247 it wasnt just physical adventure it was cultural adventure and spiritual adventure such as a voodoo pilgrimage in haiti
8114248 land diving on the tiny island in the pacific called vanuatu tribesmen climb up homemade towers and its sort of like the original bungee jumping
8114249 secretly theyre full of fireworks and dynamite at the stroke of midnight they light them all on fire in a huge loud pyromania display
8114250 we would try to have odd combinations of logos such as gluttony and grandma approved on the same thing
8114251 the icons gave the book a lot of life and people really reacted to the categories which are kind of a snapshot into daves brain
8114252 his direct reports dont follow through his team mates arent team players people dont respond quickly enough to his requests or acknowledge him for his successes his wife doesnt support him the companys culture doesnt support him people dont take him seriously and or he simply has too much to do
8114253 these poor simple folk too fearful or too dull witted to see the vulgarity and evil in their own midst they wail and complain about my uncompromising methods but who among you can say that hanging half a village is too high a price to pay for the assurance that corruption has been exposed and destroyed this day
8114254 i live before the audience of one before others i have nothing to prove nothing to gain and nothing to lose
8114255 its stupid rules that somebody made in i dont know 1850
8114256 now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8114257 how can the guy see with sunglasses from 35 metres away on a foot fault it doesnt make any sense
8114258 its not so complicated the chair umpire when they go with the linesman first when i start to make the foot fault they should tell me listen youre making a foot fault be careful next time im calling it
8114259 and if youre making it on the centre line what difference does it make doesnt help me to serve better
8114260 i think the people in tennis are missing some rules
8114261 its really really disappointing in the fourth set because after a foot fault on the second serve youre facing set point
8114262 i think i have the point here and the people should do something about it if you ask anybody in the locker room they will tell you the same thing its wrong the officials they should change something because they dont understand it
8114263 ive been already on tour for 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis i dont want to fight anybody i dont want any problems on the court i just want to enjoy it
8114264 its not like im playing because im starving to death and i need to do something original to earn money
8114265 it was tricky because the waves were crashing over his head one minute you saw him the next he was under a metre of water his fists were white from clinging on
8114266 if no one had been there he would have given up he was pretty gouged up from the rocks his feet were opened up
8114267 he is a very with a capital v lucky man
8114268 it allows you to call the police and report the intruder immediately
8114269 you can also use it to make sure the kids are home from school by 4 30 or that theyre not home at 1 30

8114579 history tells us basically that this country came to be because of dissent against a government which abused its powers by abusing its citizens the dissidents of that time are heroes now we once again find ourselves under the tyrannical rule of a king george what you read here are those exercising their rights and responsibilities to speak out against injustice i suggest you read on liberty by john stuart mill he describes the idea of personal liberty within a democratic society and the responsibility of its citizens to hold the government to high ideals and codes of conduct you are very wrong we are unhappy because we love the united states so much

8114588 chadwick isnt that who you have a crush on ashli
8114589 well the votes are done for the night lets get the fuck to bed
8114590 our confidence is really high and coach juan carlos osorio is really confident in us
8114591 that helps a lot when the coach is confident in us so were going out there getting the job done like he told us to do and were just winning so well try to keep it up
8114592 once we get going and get some good confidence were able to work real well and its great
8114593 there are a few new additions but for the most part its the same crew
8114594 its just a matter of confidence once we got going and got a couple big wins and started flying its been great we know we can keep a zero on the board and with striker juan pablo angel scoring it helps a lot too when hes getting us a goal a game and giving us some leeway
8114595 sunday was a big challenge for us because we were missing three key players rojas parke and cichero and the guys who stepped on the field did a terrific job
8114596 but its about getting the job done there was a little bit of concern during the week because of the three players who werent allowed to play or werent fit to play and we showed were back in contention again
8114597 i think it was the most solid performance weve had so far since ive been here basically we got the job done in a very good manner we were solid in every line it wasnt fancy soccer it was just very effective soccer and we won against arguably the best team in the league with probably the strongest team that they could play the only player that was missing was brian ching
8114598 its huge having angel back in form otherwise id be crossing to guys that are like five feet dane richards 5 foot 7 and mike magee 5 foot 9 they have different strengths
8114599 but juan pablo angel 6 foot 1 in the air is a big huge threat as we saw again sunday when he scored the opening goal vs houston by heading in a cross
8114600 we probably overlooked the job that juan pietravallo has done in the last three games as an anchorman in front of the back four but his contribution in my opinion is huge now we look like a very well balanced team we can attack we have some threat on the flanks juan pablo angel is always a threat but we are doing a better job defensively
8114601 i think he came in here to do whats hes doing now hes a solid player hes one of those hard tough midfielders and hes showing that week in and week out hes one of those guys who the crowd probably doesnt want to watch because he doesnt appear much in the game but when we need him hes always there i think that hes showed that the more he plays the fitter he gets and the more important he becomes we knew from day one that all four players rojas pietravallo jimenez cichero were going to be big players for us and i think thats been the case in the last three games
8114602 i believe with the effort that we showed sunday and with the team spirit and the way we can play soccer now we can compete against houston and every other team in the league
8114603 as you just mentioned we had three very important players missing and the guys who got the chance took it with both hands and made the best out of it and contributed greatly to a great win thats what this whole game is about its competition its waiting for your chance and putting in the contribution when its required when you get the opportunity and thats what the guys did
8114604 its just right that we have more competition for places and i have more options and hopefully i can decide what is best for the club
8114605 i dont believe we have a very good track record against them
8114606 i really think our depth has played a pretty big role if we can take this confidence which i think we will into d c and then chicago in the red bulls next two league fixtures i think we will be able to get some good results even away from home now
8114607 we expect the same things we always expect in games against d c
8114608 they are always tough they are a good side going forward we showed on aug 10 that we can beat them as well now we got the momentum going and its going to be a different kind of game
8114609 are showing promise vision and commitment to their entrepreneurial ideas
8114610 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8114611 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8114612 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq news
8114613 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8114614 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8114615 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8114616 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8114617 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8114618 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8114619 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8114620 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8114621 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8114622 i dont think its going to happen i think were going to get the stuff just to be safe though because were so close
8114623 so i pose the question this way what musical performance of the 20th century would you most want to either witness or take part in imagine performing in the orchestra for the rite of spring premiere in 1913 or being in the crowd at stalag viii in 1945 for messiaens performance of his quartet for the end of time
8114624 could not believe how close he obama was to becoming president and that no nigger should ever live in the white house
8114625 im going to the convention because i want to see hillary
8114626 i want to be inspired by her encouraged by her to do whats going to be the best thing for all of our futures shes trying to help us all get through this
8114627 typewriter ha remember when we used those it was back when people read newspapers ha ha ha ha ha

8114629 mesmo que seja mentira de uma hora deixa que te chame meu amor
8114630 serves as a device for sharply narrowing the range of policy debate
8114631 what neither of these candidates will be able to i think accomplish is to persuade us to look ourselves in the mirror to see the direction in which we are headed
8114632 you were meant to be here each and everyone of you
8114633 yeah right she hasnt seen my house and i cant possibly get the whole house cleaned by doing a little bit every day
8114634 your perfectionism got you where you are today housework done incorrectly still blesses your family just do it you can do anything for 15 minutes
8114635 would you talk to your children the way you talk to yourself if they dont deserve it you dont either
8114636 oh ive been so bad this week now i have to eat nothing but lettuce and tomatoes to stay within my points for the rest of the week but thats ok i deserve it
8114637 ok i havent been exercising at all so im going to start running in the park m w f and doing an hour of yoga on t th s and if i get up early i could do 50 crunches every morning too ready go
8114638 pada suatu hari salah seorang sahabat rasululloh saw yang utama ali bin abi thalib pernah berkhutbah di hadapan kaum muslimin
8114639 orang yang paling berani adalah engkau sendiri hai amirul mukminin
8114640 orang yang paling berani bukan aku tapi adalah abu bakar ketika kami membuatkan nabi pondok di medan badar kami tanyakan siapakah yang berani menemani rasululloh saw dalam pondok itu dan menjaganya dari serangan kaum musyrik tiada seorang pun yang bersedia melainkan abu bakar sendiri beliau menghunus pedangnya dihadapan nabi untuk membunuh siapa saja yang mendekati pondok nabi itulah orang yang paling berani
8114641 suatu hari pernah aku menyaksikan nabi berjalan kaki di kota mekkah
8114642 adakah orang yang beriman dari kaum firaun yang lebih baik daripada abu bakar
8114643 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
8114644 you know madness is a lot like gravity all you need is a little push
8114645 choreographers music editors costume designers spin coaches jump coaches travel expenses to competitions the expenses really start to become too much for a lot of people
8114646 the training turned out to be very stressful on my parents
8114647 i always said that if i was ever in a position where i could help give back to a young athlete in that situation i would
8114648 our foundation is kind of unique in that we give all of the money to skaters
8114649 now shes at a point where she doesnt need the support of the foundation financially since shes now making money on her own now shes able to come back and skate the show as one of our headliners and raise money and help support the generation right behind
8114650 theyre expensive and i dont think i would be able to do all those things without help from foundation
8114651 hes had a great career and knows what you have to put into it so its great that hes doing this
8114652 they are really the reason the foundation can be successful
8114653 these people that charge a fortune to do shows theyre coming for free
8114654 theyre staying in bunk beds in our house these are olympic champions its amazing
8114655 all of us were at that stage where our parents and our families were struggling to keep us in the sport because its so expensive
8114656 my goal was to help bridge that gap where the athletes are not getting full support from the association but theyre are still incurring the same expenses that an olympic athlete would
8114657 if we can help them through those rough couple of years then we can see them blossom
8114658 when they need the money isnt when they are already on top
8114659 when they need the money is when their families cant make it and so they cant give them the opportunities they need to advance
8114660 its who you are not what you do those are the things that last so much longer than the skating ability he is willing to put in the time and the effort to help other people thats part of his character
8114661 its been very rewarding for me because so many times our success is based on how many medals we win and thats rewarding on an individual level
8114662 to be able to use what youve worked your entire life for to actually help other people instead of just win a medal and hang it around your neck thats the ultimate
8114663 you really need to put these blinds at a level where you can actually see the fuel island
8114664 tell me you dont have to duck to be able to see the fuel island cause i have to
8114665 one day your pride will get the best of you
8114666 i just hope that you will realize it before its too late
8114667 my pride it was helps me to not get hurt by a dumdass like you
8114668 is my pride holding me back from what i want
8114669 damn you broke up with him thats what he said to you
8114670 yea and hes not the first to tell me that either
8114671 your pride is what makes you strong thats what makes you lin
8114672 john by your silence i know what the answer is you dont have to say it
8114673 lin its not that simple there is more to the answer then that
8114674 it is that simple you cant sugar coat it but i have to go
8114675 no command center for the cockroach army in my bedroom please
8114676 mr richards i consider that house yours not mine im sure any person you recommend to take over when you leave will be a good tenant
8114677 and is the fact that she wants to have children in there alright with you
8114678 of course im happy that my house is going to be full of life and probably laughter too
8114679 weve been praying that if this is the place god wants you that the paragguas would say yes and that they would be excited about it i guess we have our answer dont we

8114699 therefore the locals felt anwar was the best whatever the issues whether it was the swearing or others they turned a deaf ear to barisan

8114725 comtel appears to have missed the key demographic to whom this offer would appeal school aged teenagers
8114726 these subscribers often have limited income and would see the significant value in this deal while also having more spare time to fulfil their ad viewing commitments
8114727 the older demographic 18 24 year olds tend to have a higher disposable income and less time to respond to advertising messages to subsidise their mobile spend no doubt the offer will appeal to some people however i believe that this would have been a far more powerful offer on prepaid with the majority of under 18s being on prepaid currently

8114730 a significant increase in the 25 billion government loan program authorized last year to help them build more fuel efficient vehicles
8114731 the loans would allow them to overhaul their plants more quickly than they can otherwise afford to in a dismal time for the united states auto industry
8114732 theres a real urgency in that all of the progress we have made on these new vehicles could come to a standstill if we cant get capital at reasonable rates
8114733 the domestic auto industry now seeks between 40 billion and 50 billion the automakers would like to have a funded plan in place by the end of 2008
8114734 the industry is urging congress to appropriate the funds before the november 4 election and asking the energy department to complete the necessary regulations before the end of the year
8114735 the scheme known as the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program would be available to all vehicle manufacturers with operations in north america as well as parts suppliers
8114736 would be by far the biggest beneficiaries they see the loans as a way of bridging a cash shortage that is likely to continue for at least the next 18 months
8114737 the auto industrys future has been a top issue in midwest battleground states key to the presidential race
8114738 had opposed the retooling efforts arguing that his 5 000 tax credits for consumers who buy fuel efficient vehicles and a 300 million battery prize would accomplish the same goal
8114739 congress should fund the loan program in the energy bill
8114740 previously outlined support for the loans and a 10 year 150 billion program for green manufacturing obamas campaign said friday they would support the 50 billion loan program

8114777 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8114778 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8114779 insulted the most courageous pro life democrat in the land who asked that those who believed in the right to life be accorded the right to speak
8114780 we cannot say we are against abortion and then let our children suffer in broken schools
8114781 mccain voted with bush gt 90 of the time hes not a maverick hes a sidekick
8114782 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y
8114783 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8114784 we do not hit our friends we do not kick our friends we do not push our friends we do not bite our friends and we go pee and poop in the toilet
8114785 i no hit my friends i no kick my friends i no push my friends i no bite my friends and i go pee and poop in the toliet
8114786 i have met young people all over the country who are following in senator clintons footsteps speaking out against injustice at home and abroad courageously fighting for what they believe in not because its popular but because it is right
8114787 and they are raising their voices against the noise to ask the hard questions and vote for senator clinton because their hearts and minds tell them that she is the right choice
8114788 jehmu greene has broken barriers while encouraging our youth to be active in the community and i am proud to have her support
8114789 the youth in our country are hungry for change and i look forward to having her support and guidance in spreading our message
8114790 i hope your community and your black friends treat you like you deserve to be treated after creating that fear in white people minds for a few pieces of gold shame on you youre just a sell out
8114791 black on black crime in the political arena you are living proof that africans hate african americans go back to africa
8114792 this to me is like an awful treason to your own race

8114800 they cant get away with what they think they could get away with
8114801 its so engrained in me to do this because heres my motto if i can dish it out to those models i better be able to take it
8114802 if im going to put my butt in a bikini my ass better be off the back of my kneecaps if i dont look good you know who am i to be doling out all these commands

8114807 the time is now to unite as a single party
8114808 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8114809 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8114810 lets be honest this was a long tough primary campaign hillary got 18 million votes she won all the big states everybody put their heart and soul into that
8114811 a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8114812 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8114813 i see this nation differently than i did 10 months ago
8114814 that this travesty was committed by the democratic party has forever changed my approach to politics
8114815 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
8114816 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
8114817 that the winter of discontent in politics had come for women
8114818 the american womans movement and her interest in great moral and social questions is splintered into a hundred fragments under as many warring leaders
8114819 the feminist movement is dying of partial victory and inanition
8114820 where for years there had been purpose consecrated to an immortal principle
8114821 keeping the light on is probably the best contribution that we can make where there is now stygian darkness
8114822 exactly where men political leaders wanted them bound gagged divided and delivered to the republican and democratic parties
8114823 the feminist crash of the 20s came as a painful shock so painful that it took history several decades to face up to it
8114824 i am sorry for you young women who have to carry on the work in the next 10 years for suffrage was a symbol and you have lost your symbol
8114825 there are no limits to what is possible in america
8114826 its fitting that mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities becuase these days its awfully hard to tell them apart
8114827 this van dyken lady sure seems like a swell gal

8114838 their objectives were not to assist developing countries but as promoted by the trilateral commission to curb world population with a view to serving us strategic and national security interests
8114839 with markets and resources we have a right to make sure that we control them which is logical on the principle that we own the world anyway so of course we have that right

8114843 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught whether by word or our epistle
8114844 but my church is non traditional because were free in the spirit
8114845 i dont like knowing thats going to be out there before she speaks it might injure her credibility a little bit
8114846 i think it will separate them but whether it will actually help bring any mccain voters to any great extent im not sure

8114910 la abstenci n total de la acci n cat lica con respecto a los partidos pol ticos

8114934 wahai manusia sesungguhnya allah swt maha baik dan dia tidak akan menerima kecuali dari yang baik sesungguhnya allah memerintahkan kepada orang orang yang beriman dengan apa yang telah diperintahkan kepada para rasul allah berfirman hai rasul rasul makanlah dari makanan yang baik baik dan kerjakanlah amal yang saleh sesungguhnya aku maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan qs 51 dan berfirman pula hai orang orang yang beriman makanlah di antara rezki yang baik baik yang kami berikan kepadamu dan bersyukurlah kepada allah jika benar benar hanya kepada allah kamu menyembah qs al baqarah 172 kemudian rasulullah menyebutkan tentang seorang yang melakukan perjalanan panjang rambutnya terurai dan berdebu lalu mengangkat tangannya ke langit ya rabbi ya rabbi sedang makanannya haram minumannya haram pakaiananya haram dan dagingnya tumbuh dari yang haram maka bagaimana dia akan dikabulkan untuk itu
8114935 aku sudah berkali kali berdoa namun tidak melihat tanda tanda doaku itu diterima
8114936 ya allah aku berdoa kepada mu sebagaimana engkau perintahkan kepadaku maka kabulkanlah doa kami sebagaimana kau menjanjikannya kepada kami
8114937 akan dikabulkan untuk salah seorang dari kalian selagi dia tidak tergesa gesa dengan mengatakan aku berdoa kepada allah namun dia tidak mengabulkan
8114938 ditangguhkannya pemberian meski sudah dilakukan berulang ulang dalam doa tidak menjadi alasan bagi anda untuk berputus as karena allah menjamin doa anda akan dikabulkan dalam bentuk yang akan dia pilih untukmu bukan dalam bentuk yang anda pilih dan dalam waktu yang dia kehendaki bukan waktu yang anda kehendaki
8114939 seorang hamba akan selalu dikabulkan doanya selagi dia tidak berdoa untuk perbuatan dosa atau memutuskan silaturahmi selagi dia tidak tergesa gesa
8114940 tidaklah seorang muslim berdoa kepada allah swt dengan sesuatu yang tidak mengandung perbuatan dosa atau memutuskan silaturahim kecuali allah akan memberinya salah satu dari tiga hal adakalanya doa segera dikabulkan adakalanya disimpan baginya di akhirat dan adakalanya dia dihindarkan dari keburukan seukuran doa itu
8114941 janganlah kalian berdoa atas diri kalian kecuali dengan kebaikan karena malaikat mengamini apa yang kalian katakan
8114942 janganlah kalian berdoa meminta mati dan jangan mengharap harapkannya jika ada orang yang harus berdoa maka hendaknya dia mengatakan ya allah hidupkan aku jika hidup itu lebih baik bagiku dan matikan aku jika kematian itu lebih baik bagiku
8114943 janganlah kalian mendoakan keburukan untuk diri kalian janganlah kalian mendoakan keburukan untuk anak kalian janganlah kalian mendoakan keburukan untuk harta kalian jangan sampai kalian berada dalam suatu waktu dengan allah yang bila digunakan untuk berdoa jelek allah akan mengabulkan doa jelek kalian
8114944 waspadalah pada doa orang yang terzhalimi allah akan mengangkat doanya di atas awan dan mengatakan kepada doa itu demi kemuliaan dan keagungan ku aku pasti akan menolongmu meskipun setelah beberapa waktu
8114945 barangsiapa diantara kalian melihat kemungkaran maka hendaknya ia mengubahnya dengan tangannya jika tidak mampu maka hendaknya ia mengubahnya dengan lisannya jika tidak mampu maka hendaknya ia mengubahnya dengan hatinya dan itu adalah iman yang paling lemah
8114946 dan hendaklah ada di antara kamu segolongan umat yang menyeru kepada kebajikan menyuruh kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar mereka adalah orang orang yang beruntung
8114947 telah dilaknati orang orang kafir dari bani israil dengan lisan daud dan isa putera maryam yang demikian itu disebabkan mereka durhaka dan selalu melampaui batas mereka satu sama lain selalu tidak melarang tindakan munkar yang mereka perbuat sesungguhnya amat buruklah apa yang selalu mereka perbuat itu
8114948 3 orang yang berdoa kepada allah swt namun tidak dikabulkan bagi mereka seorang punya istri yang akhlaknya rusak namun ia tidak menceraikannya seseorang yang menyerahkan hartanya pada orang lain namun ia tidak melakukan persaksian atasnya dan seorang yang memberikan harta pada orang yang lemah mentalnya
8114949 sesungguhnya allah berfirman dalam hadist qudsi barangsiapa memusuhi kekasih ku maka aku umumkan perang atasnya dan seorang hamba tidak mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan sesuatu yang lebih aku suka dari apa yang telah aku wajibkan seorang hamba ku senantiasa mendekatkan diri pada ku dengan amal amal nafilah sunnah hingga aku mencintainya dan jika aku mencintainya maka aku akan menjadi pedengarannya yang dia gunakan untuk mendengar aku akan menjadi penglihatannya yang ia gunakan untuk melihat aku akan menjadi tangannya yang ia gunakan untuk menangkap dan aku akan menjadi kakinya yang ia gunakan untuk berjalan jika ia meminta kepada ku pasti aku akan memberinya dan jika ia meminta perlindungan kepada ku pasti dia akan aku lindungi

8114961 treaty between his britannic majesty and the king of the netherlands respecting territory and commerce in the east indies
8114962 in complete agreement with the spirit and the content of the treaty concluded between their majesties the kings of the netherlands and great britain
8114963 the division of the lands of johor pahang riau and lingga was stipulated
8114964 t he part of the lands assigned to the latter
8114965 your territory thus extends over johor and pahang on the mainland or on the malay peninsula the territory of your brother abdul rahman extends out over the islands of lingga bintan galang bulan karimon and all other islands whatsoever may be in the sea this is the territory of your brother and whatever is situated on the mainland is yours
8114966 which are in general meaningless for that purpose having been carried out by a state which already having claims to assert in a legal dispute could have taken those actions strictly with the aim of buttressing those claims
8114967 it cannot take into consideration acts having taken place after the date on which the dispute between the parties crystallized unless such acts are a normal continuation of prior acts and are not undertaken for the purpose of improving the legal position of the party which relies on them
8114968 t he protest note of 14 february 1980 crystallized the dispute 17 on this basis the critical date for the dispute over pulau batu puteh is 14 february 1980
8114969 it was only in 1979 that malaysia made a formal claim to the island through the publication of its map
8114970 for the first time during the first round of bilateral discussions between the parties included middle rocks and south ledge in addition to its claim to pulau batu puteh
8114971 response to malaysias statement made a day earlier describing middle rocks and south ledge as two malaysian islands
8114972 i t follows that the critical date for all three features must naturally be the same
8114973 malaysia has an original title to pulau batu puteh of long standing pulau batu puteh is and has always been part of the malaysian state of johor nothing has happened to displace malaysias sovereignty over it singapores presence on the island for the sole purpose of constructing and maintaining a lighthouse there with the permission of the territorial sovereign is insufficient to vest sovereignty in it
8114974 pbp could not at any relevant time be considered as terra nullius and hence susceptible to acquisition through occupation there is nothing to demonstrate that johor had lost its title since there is no evidence that at any time it had the intention of ceding let alone abandoning its sovereignty over the island
8114975 singapores case is that the events of 1847 to 1851 constituted a taking of lawful possession of pedra branca by agents of the british crown in the years that followed the british crown and subsequently singapore continually exercised acts of state authority in respect of pedra branca this effective and peaceful exercise of state authority confirmed and maintained the title gained in the period 1847 to 1851 by the taking of lawful possession on behalf of the crown
8114976 the basis of singapores title to pedra branca can be analysed as follows a the selection of pedra branca as the site for building of the lighthouse with the authorization of the british crown constituted a classic taking of possession titre de souverain b title was acquired by the british crown in accordance with the legal principles governing acquisition of territory in 1847 1851 c the title acquired in 1847 1851 has been maintained by the british crown and its lawful successor the republic of singapore
8114977 i t is obvious that the status of pedra branca in 1847 was that of terra nullius
8114978 singapores title to pedra branca is based upon the taking of lawful possession of the island by the british authorities in singapore during the period 1847 to 1851 malaysia claims that prior to 1847 pedra branca was under the sovereignty of johor however there is absolutely no evidence to support malaysias claim mr president the truth is that prior to 1847 pedra branca was terra nullius and had never been the subject of a prior claim or any manifestation of sovereignty by any sovereign entity
8114979 the burden remains at all times on malaysia to produce specific proof that old johor had sovereignty over pedra branca and carried out acts of a sovereign nature on or over the island malaysia has produced no evidence whatever in this regard
8114980 malaysia appears to forget that the burden of proof in respect of the facts and contentions on which the respective claims of the parties are based will of course lie on the party asserting or putting them forward temple of preah vihear cambodia v thailand merits judgment i c j reports 1962 p 16 it is thus for malaysia to show that johor could demonstrate some title to pedra branca yet it has done no such thing
8114981 t he sultanate of johor covered all the islands within this large area including all those in the singapore straits such as pulau batu puteh and the islands to the north and south of the straits taking in singapore island and the adjacent islands
8114982 pulau batu puteh sitting at the eastern entrance of the singapore straits lies right in the middle of the old sultanate of johor
8114983 rather it is the case that from time immemorial pedra branca pulau batu puteh was under the sovereignty of the sultanate of johor
8114984 possession immemorial is that which has lasted for such a long time that it is impossible to provide evidence of a different situation and of which anybody recalls having heard talk
8114985 there is no evidence that pedra branca belonged to the johor sultanate at any point in its history and certainly not at the beginning of the nineteenth century
8114986 t his was the political condition of the sultanate in 1819 when the british arrived in singapore and on the eve of the signing of the anglo dutch treaty of 1824
8114987 t he sultanate of johor covered all the islands within this large area of its territory including all those in the singapore straits such as pulau batu puteh
8114988 there is in india a kingdom called johore which has long been considered a sovereign principality supremi principatus so that its ruler clearly possessed the authority necessary to conduct a public war against the portuguese
8114989 cruise to the south of singapore straits under the hook of barbukit and in the vicinity of pedra branca
8114990 the king of johor ha d sent an envoy to the governor of melaka to indicate his great displeasure regarding the seizure of the above mentioned two junks not without using offensive and threatening terms in the event that the same thing occurs in the future
8114991 all the islands in the mouth of the straits of malacca with all those in the china seas as far as the natunas
8114992 but extends to the seas straits and islets the latter probably not less than 50 in number within ten geographical miles of its coasts
8114993 it does not upon the whole appear to me that the occupation of rhio could be beneficial to the british government yet its retention on the part of the netherlands government and our exclusion from entering into political relations with the chiefs of all the islands lying south to the straits of singapore and between the peninsula and sumatra may prove a matter of some inconvenience to us as it is in fact virtually amounts to a dismemberment of the principality of johor and must thus be productive of some embarrassment and confusion this may be easily illustrated by an example the carimon islands and the malayan settlement of bulang are two of the principal possessions of the tumongong of johor or singapore and his claim to them is not only allowed by the rival chiefs but satisfactorily ascertained by the voluntary and cheerful allegiance yielded to him by the inhabitants by the present treaty however he must either forego all claims to these possessions or removing to them renounce his connection with the british government
8114994 t he frequent and regular occurrence of acts of piracy in the immediate neighbourhood of singapore
8114995 the places and islands near which these piracies are most frequently committed and where the pirates go for shelter and concealment such as pulo tinghie batu puteh point romania amp c are all within the territories of our well beloved ally and pensionary the sultan of johore or rather of the tomungong of johore for he is the real sovereign
8114996 its probative value is highly suspect considering it does not indicate the source of the information or even the name of its author
8114997 denmark possessed full and entire sovereignty over the whole of greenland and that norway had recognized that sovereignty
8114998 which had not been occupied in such a manner as to bring them effectively under the administration of the danish government
8114999 terrae nullius and that if they ceased to be terrae nullius they must pass under norwegian sovereignty
8115000 another circumstance which must be taken into account by any tribunal which has to adjudicate upon a claim to sovereignty over a particular territory is the extent to which the sovereignty is also claimed by some other power in most of the cases involving claims to territorial sovereignty which have come before an international tribunal there have been two competing claims to the sovereignty and the tribunal has 24 had to decide which of the two is the stronger one of the peculiar features of the present case is that up to 1931 there was no claim by any power other than denmark to the sovereignty over greenland indeed up till 1921 no power disputed the danish claim to sovereignty
8115001 bearing in mind the absence of any claim to sovereignty by another power and the arctic and inaccessible character of the uncolonized parts of the country the king of denmark and norway displayed in 1721 to 1814 his authority to an extent sufficient to give his country a valid claim to sovereignty and that his rights over greenland were not limited to the colonized area
8115002 in fact at every moment on every point of a territory
8115003 i n the exercise of territorial sovereignty there are necessarily gaps intermittence in time and discontinuity in space the fact that a state cannot prove display of sovereignty as regards such a portion of territory cannot forthwith be interpreted as showing that sovereignty is inexistent each case must be appreciated in accordance with the particular circumstances
8115004 continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty peaceful in relation to other states
8115005 strict rules should be carried out against those half fishing half piratical sect the orang ryot or laut being allowed to obtain admittance into the building they frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them in the straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people
8115006 some individuals of the race of malays called orang laut that is men of the sea
8115007 they have a rough exterior and their speech is awkward and uncouth but in other respects i could observe little essential difference between them and other malays these people have adopted the mohammedan religion they are divided into at least twenty tribes distinguished usually by the straits or narrow seas they principally frequent a few of them have habitations on shore but by far the greater number live constantly in their boats and nearly their sole occupation is fishing they are subjects of the king of johore and the same people who have been called orang selat or men of the straits the straits here alluded to being not the great straits of malacca which are extensive beyond their comprehension but the narrow guts running among the little islets that are so abundantly strewed over its eastern entrance under this appellation they have been notorious for their piracies from the earliest knowledge of europeans respecting these countries
8115008 the subjects of the sultan of johor who inhabit the islands are usually by the malays termed orang rayat the common oriental word signifying a subject generally but is here restricted to one class of the sultans subjects they live in small and detached communities or settlements on the several islands under the immediate control of two officers called orang kaya and batin the latter being subordinate to the former these officers are appointed by the sultan of johore differences arising among the parties which cannot be settled by the panglima i e captain are reserved for the decision of the chief or of the sultan himself on their return such are the habits and mode of life of the rayats of johor the sultan of johor can on emergency such as a war with a neighbouring chief command their services on such an occasion it is said he can assemble from the several islands and places under his authority from three hundred to four hundred prows
8115009 malaysia has glossed over the traditional malay concept of sovereignty this concept undermines malaysias claim to an original title it is based mainly on control over people and not control over territory traditional malay sovereignty is people centric and not territory centric
8115010 what it means is that the only reliable way to determine whether a particular territory belonged to a ruler is to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler the concept also means that it was difficult to determine with accuracy the territorial extent of the johor sultanate at any time this would certainly be the case with regard to barren isolated and uninhabited islands such as pedra branca therefore unless malaysia can produce clear evidence of a direct claim to or the actual exercise of sovereign authority over pedra branca any attempt to argue that the island belonged to old johor is totally devoid of merit
8115011 authority in states throughout the world has characteristically been based on a combination of control over people and over territory this applies to the malay states as well as any other the fact that singapore can demonstrate shifting political fortunes and even division within the royal household of johor does not undermine conceptions of continuity in a malay polity ever since the establishment of the sultanate of johor in the early 16th century there have always been rulers who were recognized as such and who commanded the allegiance of the people accordingly and thereby held sway over the territory where those people lived
8115012 in the period relevant to malaysias claim there were two different political entities in the region that were called johor
8115013 t he first proposition is not supported by any evidence
8115014 malaysia tries to prove this proposition by arguing that the effect of the anglo dutch treaty was to split the johor sultanate into two parts and to place pedra branca in the northern part within the british sphere of influence thus allocating it to new johor this is a misrepresentation of the treaty
8115015 divid ing the sultanate of johor into two separate spheres of influence
8115016 his netherlands majesty withdraws the objections which have been made to the occupation of the island of singapore by the subjects of his britannik majesty his britannik majesty however engages that no british establishment shall be made on the carimon isles or on the islands of battam bintang lingin or on any of the other islands south of the straights of singapore nor any treaty concluded by british authority with the chiefs of those islands
8115017 the anglo dutch treaty of 17 march 1824 resulted in the split of the johor riau lingga sultanate it divided the sultanate of johor into two separate spheres of influence islands south of the straits of singapore were left within the 30 dutch sphere of influence that was the riau lingga sultanate while the territory and all islands in the straits of singapore and to the north of the straits were placed within the british sphere of influence and that was the johor sultanate
8115018 the anglo dutch treaty did not contemplate any demarcation line this is clear from the negotiating history of the treaty an earlier draft of the treaty inserted an article providing for a demarcation line but this article was omitted when the text of the treaty was finalized the text of the anglo dutch treaty also confirms that there is no line article x excludes the dutch from any part of the peninsula of malacca that is the malay peninsula while article xii excludes the british from any of the islands south of the straights of singapore there is no provision excluding either state from any part of the straits or any islands within the strait in other words the treaty did not divide up the strait between the two powers the width of the entire strait was left open for access by both states as was intended
8115019 desiring to place upon a footing mutually beneficial their respective possessions and the commerce of their subjects in the east indies so that the welfare and prosperity of both nations may be promoted in all time to come without those differences and jealousies which have in former times interrupted the harmony which ought always to subsist between them and in order to determine certain questions which have occurred in the execution of the convention made at london on the 13th of august 1814 in so far as it respects the possessions his netherlands majesty in the east
8115020 o ur acquisition of these islets under the crawfurd treaty is not at variance with the obligations of the treaty concluded at london in march last i e the anglo dutch treaty of 1824 as they are all situated north of the southern limits of the straights of singapore
8115021 their highnesses the sultan hussain mahomed shah and datu tumungong abdul rahman sri maharajah hereby cede in full sovereignty and property to the honourable the english east india company their heirs and successors for ever the island of singapore situated in the straits of malacca together with the adjacent seas straits and islets to the extent of ten geographical miles from the coast of the said main island of singapore
8115022 johor could not have ceded the territory of singapore island and islets situated within ten geographical i e nautical miles to the english east india company if johor did not have title to it
8115023 the 33 fact that it had a title which it was capable of ceding shows that the johor title to the area before 1824 included both pbp and sovereignty over singapore
8115024 is not based on the treaty of cession of 1824
8115025 t hat treaty dealt only with the main island of singapore and its immediate vicinity and did not extend to the area around pedra branca
8115026 british recognition of prior and continuing sovereignty of the sultanate of johor over all other islands in and around the strait of singapore
8115027 the island of singapore together with the adjacent seas straits and islets to the extent of ten geographical miles
8115028 the anglo dutch treaty did not by its terms effect a division of the johor riau lingga sultanate
8115029 the subsequent dismemberment of the sultanate resulted from the practical fact that sultan abdul rahman who in the eyes of the locals was the legitimate ruler of the johor riau lingga sultanate could no longer exert effective power in the malay peninsula which had fallen within the british sphere the territorial extent of the northern breakaway fragments i e peninsular johor and pahang is not determined by the terms of the anglo dutch treaty but by subsequent acts of and dealings amongst the relevant malay rulers
8115030 one example of such dealing was the express donation of territory by sultan abdul rahman to sultan hussein one year after the anglo dutch treaty was signed this donation was made on the advice of the dutch who wished to avoid any confusion over which territories remained under the control of sultan abdul rahman in the post anglo dutch treaty period in 1825 they sent an official to explain to the sultan the implications of the anglo dutch treaty and to advise him to formally cede the mainland territories of johor and pahang to his brother hussein
8115031 your brother sends you this letter to give you notice of the conclusion of a treaty between his majesty the king of the netherlands and his majesty the king of great britain whereby the division of the lands of johor pahang riau and lingga is stipulated the part of the lands assigned to you my brother i donate to you with complete satisfaction and sincere affection for we are brothers and the only children left behind by our father your territory thus extends over johor and pahang on the mainland or on the malay peninsula the territory of your brother extends out over the islands of lingga bintan galang bulan karimon and all other islands whatsoever may be in the sea this is the territory of your brother and whatever is situated on the mainland is yours on the basis of these premises i earnestly beseech you that your notables the paduka bendahara of pahang and temenggong abdul rahman will not in the slightest concern themselves with the islands that belong to your brother
8115032 t he nature and terms of sultan abdul rahmans donation of territories to sultan hussein is another impediment to malaysias claim that original title to pedra branca is derived from the johor riau lingga sultanate
8115033 even if pedra branca was a possession of the johor riau lingga sultanate which it was not it would have been retained by sultan abdul rahman and not become part of the state of johor
8115034 in its counter memorial singapore suggests that it was not the anglo dutch treaty that determined the extent of the johor sultanate but instead the donation by sultan abdul rahman by letter of 25 june 1825 of mainland territories in peninsular malaya to his brother sultan hussain in 1825 the donation of sultan abdul rahman must be read in the context of what is stipulated under article xii of the anglo dutch treaty of 1824 by no means does it serve as johors title to its territory the territories specified by sultan abdul rahman to be his own the one under the dutch sphere of influence in the letter of 25 june 1825 comprise the islands of lingga bintan galang bulan karimon and all other islands out of these five specified islands three were mentioned in article xii of the anglo dutch treaty of 1824 namely the carimon islands bintang and lingga while the remaining two galang and bulan are islands clearly lying south of the strait of singapore the phrase all other islands refers to all other islands lying within the dutch sphere of influence and not named explicitly in the letter e g batam and singkep to sum up this letter was not a donation but was instead a formal recognition that sultan abdul rahman did not claim sovereignty over johor
8115035 in the eyes of the locals was the legitimate ruler of the johor riau lingga sultanate
8115036 to formally cede the mainland territories of johor and pahang to his brother hussein
8115037 is equivalent to tacit recognition manifested by unilateral conduct which the other party may interpret as consent
8115038 malaysia could somehow show an historic title over the island singapore would still possess sovereignty over pedra branca since singapore has exercised continuous sovereignty over the island while malaysia has done nothing
8115039 the notion of prescription has no role to play in the present case
8115040 still some way in which the court can override johors title on the basis of britains post 1851 conduct
8115041 at a general meeting of the subscribers a wish was expressed that the contributions should if possible be devoted to the building of a light house bearing the name of horsburgh on pedra branca at the entrance of the china sea but nothing definitive was resolved on as this is a design which can only be carried into effect and maintained under the immediate auspices of the british government we beg to express our readiness to hand over the above amount to you in the hope that you will have the goodness to cause a light house called after horsburgh to be erected either on pedra branca or on such other locality as the government of the honble east india company may deem preferable the amount is far from adequate but we trust the well known munificience of the honble company will supply what additional funds may be wanting for an object of such eminent public utility intended at the same time to do honor to the memory of one of the most meritorious of their servants
8115042 i have received my friends letter and in reply desire to acquaint my friend that i perfectly understand his wishes and i am exceedingly pleased at the intention expressed therein as it a light house will enable traders and others to enter and leave this port with greater confidence
8115043 i have duly received my friends communication and understand the contents my friend is desirous of erecting a light house near point romania i can have no possible objection to such a measure indeed i am much pleased that such an undertaking is in contemplation i wish to be guided in all matters by the government so much so that the company are at full liberty to put up a light house there or any spot deemed eligible myself and family for many years have derived support from singapore our dependence is wholly on the english government and we hope to merit the protection of and be favoured by the company on all occasions consistent with propriety
8115044 the funds adverted to amounting to 5513 dollars or 12 978 8 4 companys rupees being still forthcoming as will be perceived by the enclosed copy of a letter from messrs john purvis amp co a and feeling persuaded of the very great necessity for a light house and the advantage it would prove to the growing trade with china i took upon myself to submit the subject for the consideration of captain sir edward belcher c b in the hope that some site might be determined upon which would be free from the objections referred to and meet the object in view the report b of that scientific officer i desire to lay before the right honble the governor general of india with the plan and section of the rock therein alluded to prepared by mr thomson the surveyor together with an outline chart shewing its position with reference to pedra branca the main land of johore and island of romania situated about 32 miles in an e by n direction form singapore this rock is part of the territories of the rajah of johore who with the tamongong c have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the east india company
8115045 lost or injured by touching on the rock in the vicinity of the site selected
8115046 opening of the four ports in china and the establishment of a colony at hong kong
8115047 trusting i have said sufficient to interest the right honble the governor general on a subject of such vast importance to the trade of our country and the safety of the mariner european and native i venture most respectfully to entreat his honors support to the measure with the honble court of directors who may then be induced probably in conjunction with her majestys govt to furnish the additional sum required and order a lantern to be at once constructed in the meantime if permitted i will move the trading community in aid of a work which will perpetuate their gratitude for the facilities afforded to the navigation of these seas by the indefatigable researches of james horsburgh esquire
8115048 wishing to be guided in all matters by the government so much so that the company are at full liberty to put up a light house
8115049 abrogate s and annul s all earlier conventions treaties and agreements
8115050 with the exception of such prior conditions as have conferred on the honourable the english east india company any right or title to the occupation or possession of the island of singapore and its dependencies as above mentioned
8115051 that the english government do covenant and agree to build and keep a light house for the benefit of all nations in relation to their ships or boats upon the said cape rachado commonly called tanjong tuan and in the event of the english government failing to abide by the said agreement then and in such case the cession upon my part to be null and void
8115052 whereas in or about the month of february 1885 it was agreed by and between his late highness abu bakar then maharajah of johore and the governor of the straits settlements that the said maharajah should grant to the government of the straits settlements a plot of ground in the island of pulau pisang in the straits of malacca as a site for a lighthouse and a roadway thereto from the beach and that the said government should build and effectively maintain a lighthouse upon the said island such grant as aforesaid to be void if a lighthouse was not erected within a reasonable time from the date of such grant or if the said government neglected properly to keep and maintain such lighthouse when it was built
8115053 malaysia has always respected the position of singapore as operator of horsburgh lighthouse and i would like to place formally on record that malaysia will continue to do so
8115054 as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance
8115055 decidedly of opinion that pedra branca is the only proper position for a light to be placed for the safety of shipping whether entering or departing for the straits of singapore
8115056 will at once perceive that pedra branca is the only true position
8115057 the whole of the details for the care case of light houses as set forth
8115058 whole of the details for the case of light houses
8115059 requires an intention to acquire sovereignty a permanent intention to do so and overt action to implement the intention and to make the intention to acquire manifest to other states
8115060 such is absolutely necessary or commensurate with the permanent expense which such an establishment must necessarily occasion romania moreover belongs to the sovereign of johore where the british possess no legal jurisdiction it will of course be necessary for the steamer or gun boats to visit pedro branca weekly some benefits would also accrue by requesting his highness the tumongong to form a village at romania under the control of a respectable panghuloo to render assistance to the inmates of the light house in a case of emergency
8115061 the most powerful native chief in these parts allied to british interests he remained at my house for two days employing his leisure in fishing
8115062 on the 27th september the honorable colonel butterworth c b governor of the straits settlements with a party consisting of sir william jeffcott recorder of the straits settlements colonel messitter commanding the troops captain barker h m s amazon mr purvis and the principal merchants of singapore together with several military officers arrived off the rock at 1 p m when they landed and minutely inspected the pharos
8115063 particularly about the measures taken by government to advance the views of the promoters of this public work
8115064 the remainder of the funds necessary to the completion of the testimonial was advanced by the government to be repaid by a light house due on shipping there was otherwise extensive aid afforded in the employment of their steamers gun boats and officers none of the expence of which was charged against the works i have already had the pleasure of mentioning the highly gratifying assistance of the dutch authorities of rhio in placing gun boats as tenders to the operations
8115065 the enterprize of british merchants and the liberal aid of the east india company
8115066 all such lighthouses as are now established in or near to the straits of malacca or singapore
8115067 those parts of the territorial waters of the colony which are outside the limits of any port
8115068 lighthouses buoys beacons and other navigational aids in singapore including those at pedra branca horsburgh and at pulau pisang
8115069 lights and navigational aids within the port limits and on the maintenance of the light at pulau pisang which is not within territorial waters
8115070 to remove doubts as to the exercise of power and jurisdiction by her majesty within diverse countries and places out of her majestys dominions and to render the same more effectual
8115071 by treaty capitulation grant usage sufferance and any other lawful means
8115072 lawful for her majesty to hold exercise and enjoy any power or jurisdiction which her majesty now hath or may at any time hereafter have within any country or place out of her majestys dominions in the same and as ample a manner as if her majesty had acquired such power or jurisdiction by the cession or conquest of territory
8115073 as it is close to the coast of the federation
8115074 all islands and places which on a specific date were administered as part of the colony of singapore
8115075 i am directed to ask for information about the rock some 40 miles from singapore known as pedra branca on which the horsburgh lighthouse stands the matter is relevant to the determination of the boundaries of the colonys territorial waters it appears this rock is outside the limits ceded by sultan hussain and the dato tumunggong to the east india company with the island of singapore in the treaty of 1824 extract at a it was however mentioned in a despatch from the 56 governor of singapore on 28th november 1844 extract at b the lighthouse was built in 1850 by the colony government who have maintained it ever since this by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on the colony 2 in the case of pulau pisang which is also outside the treaty limits of the colony it has been possible to trace an indenture in the johore registry of deeds dated 6th october 1900 this shows that a part of pulau pisang was granted to the crown for the purposes of building a lighthouse certain conditions were attached and it is clear that there was no abrogation of the sovereignty of johore the status of pisang is quite clear 3 it is how now desired to clarify the status of pedra branca i would therefore be most grateful to know whether there is any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been ceded by the government of the state of johore or in any other way disposed of 4 a copy of this letter is being sent to the chief secretary kuala lumpur
8115076 together with adjacent seas straits and islets to the extent of ten geographical miles from the coast of the said main island of singapore
8115077 this rock i e pedra branca is part of a territory of the rajah of johore who with the tumunggong has willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the east india company
8115078 doubtless wish to consult with the commissioner for lands and mines and chief surveyor and any existing archives before forwarding the views of the state government to the chief secretary
8115079 i have the honour to refer to your letter dated 12th june 1953 addressed to the british adviser johore on the question of the status of pedra branca rock some 40 miles from singapore and to inform you that the johore government does not claim ownership of pedra branca
8115080 clearly references the crawfurd treaty of 1824 as determining the relevant territorial limits of singapore and the 1844 permission of johor to the building of the lighthouse
8115081 international usage no doubt conferr ing some rights and obligations on the colony
8115082 that there was no abrogation of the sovereignty of johore the status of pulau pisang is quite clear
8115083 any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it had been ceded by the government of the state of johore or in any other way disposed of
8115084 the legal capacity to write the 1953 letter or to renounce disclaim or confirm title of any part of the territories of johore
8115085 johor a sovereign state transferred to great britain all its rights powers and jurisdiction on matters relating to defence and external affairs
8115086 without the knowledge and consent of his majestys government he will not make any treaty enter into any engagement deal in or correspond on political matters with or send envoys to any foreign state
8115087 the prerogatives power and jurisdiction of his highness within the state of johore shall be those which his highness the sultan of johore possessed on the first day of december 1941 subject nevertheless to the provisions of the federation agreement and this agreement
8115088 complete control of the defence and of all the external affairs of the federation
8115089 a the implementing of treaties conventions and agreements with other countries or international organizations b obligations of the federation in relation to the british empire and any part thereof
8115090 to make laws for the peace order and good government of the federation with respect to the matters set out in the second schedule to this agreement and subject to any qualifications therein
8115091 had no power no competence to deal with matters pertaining to external affairs or to promulgate such laws
8115092 simply that by declaring that johor did not claim pedra branca the letter had the effect of confirming singapores title to pedra branca and of confirming that johor had no title historic or otherwise to the island
8115093 by the same token the 1953 letter did not encroach on the external affairs power of the federation
8115094 save as expressed herein this agreement shall not affect the sovereignty and jurisdiction of their highnesses the rulers in their several states
8115095 relevant to the determination of the boundaries of the colonys territorial waters
8115096 that the johore government does not claim ownership of pedra branca
8115097 o n the strength of the reply we can claim pedra branca
8115098 only result in an undesirable restriction to fishing grounds normally used by singapore fishermen
8115099 for general reasons also any enclosure of the high seas by foreign states is contrary to the interest of this densely populated maritime colony dependent on sea borne trade
8115100 states make statements by which their freedom of action is to be limited a restrictive interpretation is called for
8115101 in order to facilitate the necessary approval from the various government ministries concerned
8115102 firstly singapore had flown the singapore flag over the island secondly when certain malaysian marine boats tried to dock on the island recently for some survey work they were refused permission to land
8115103 the representatives of singapore and malaysia declared that the defence of the two countries was indivisible and required close and continuing co operation between them this declaration was welcomed by the representatives of the other three governments all representatives at the conference regarded it as an indispensable basis for future defence co operation the representative of malaysia and singapore said that their governments were resolved to do their utmost for their own defence and they would welcome the co operation and assistance of the other three governments
8115104 bring down the singapore flag from malaysian soil at pulau pisang
8115105 in order that communications needs for both security and defence could be met
8115106 has raised serious concerns about singapores use of horsburgh lighthouse for non light and especially military purposes
8115107 t his conduct does not fall within the consent given for the construction and operation of the lighthouse
8115108 does not need a bigger island for a better lighthouse what does it need a bigger island for
8115109 extending to the international boundaries wherever they may be established
8115110 but excluding the islands of the states of johore pahang and trengganu and an area three miles from the base lines from which the territorial waters of such islands are measured
8115111 extended malaysian territorial waters to and beyond pulau batu puteh there was no sense at the time that pulau batu puteh and its surrounding waters were anything other than malaysian territory the legislation drew no protest from singapore
8115112 carefully avoided any intrusion into the area in the vicinity of pedra branca pulau batu puteh
8115113 which has sovereignty over pedra branca pulau batu puteh and the adjacent features
8115114 the board formed by statute in 1957 is responsible for the provision and upkeep of all ship navigational aids in singapore waters and for the outlying stations at pedra branca horsburgh in the south china sea and pulau pisang in the malacca strait within singapore waters the board maintains raffles sultan shoal and fullerton lighthouses 33 light beacons 29 unlit beacons 15 light buoys and 8 unlit buoys
8115115 the map still stands as a statement of geographical fact especially when the state adversely affected has itself produced and disseminated it even against its own interest
8115116 a first both middle rocks and south ledge form geographically and morphologically a single group of maritime features and b second malaysia is unable to show that it has appropriated these maritime features through any acts of sovereignty since these uninhabited unoccupied reefs have never been independently appropriated by malaysia they belong to singapore by virtue of them falling within singapores territorial waters generated by pedra branca
8115117 as regards groups of islands it is possible that a group may under certain circumstances be regarded as in law a unit and that the fate of the principal part may involve the rest
8115118 as regards meanguerita the chamber does not consider it possible in the absence of evidence on the point that the legal position of that island could have been other than identical with that of meanguera
8115119 unable to show any exercise of sovereignty over middle rocks to establish a title to them
8115120 1 a low tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide where a low tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island the low water line on that elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea 2 where a low tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island it has no territorial sea of its own
8115121 a coastal state has sovereignty over low tide elevations which are situated within its territorial sea since it has sovereignty over the territorial sea itself
8115122 contrary to middle rocks south ledge is a low tide elevation which as such cannot be subject to separate appropriation
8115123 a coastal state has sovereignty over low tide elevations which are situated within its territorial sea since it has sovereignty over the territorial sea itself the decisive question for the present case is whether a state can acquire sovereignty by appropriation over a low tide elevation situated within the breadth of its territorial sea when that same low tide elevation lies also within the breadth of the territorial sea of another state
8115124 international treaty law is silent on the question whether low tide elevations can be considered to be territory nor is the court aware of a uniform and widespread state practice which might have given rise to a customary rule which unequivocally permits or excludes appropriation of low tide elevations the few existing rules do not justify a general assumption that low tide elevations are territory in the same sense as islands it has never been disputed that islands constitute terra firma and are subject to the rules and principles of territorial acquisition the difference in effects which the law of the sea attributes to islands and low tide elevations is considerable it is thus not established that in the absence of other rules and legal principles low tide elevations can from the viewpoint of the acquisition of sovereignty be fully assimilated with islands or other land territory

8115211 why vote on cha cha when they know so many people are against it why rush cha cha now when they know the senate is against it these maneuvers by arroyos allies in the lower house are suspicious indeed the release of pork barrel funds in time for the cha cha vote also raises more suspicion on the voting
8115212 arroyos allies in congress are definitely pushing the issue of cha cha against all odds it may be a desperate bid or a prelude to something more sinister
8115213 with or without the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain the game plan of mrs arroyo still appears to be charter change the moa now appears to be a mere entry point for cha cha as far as the regime is concerned

8115218 the american church is in the midst of one of the largest mission fields in the world today only three other nations china india and indonesia have more lost people
8115219 essentially what was a churched supposedly christian culture has become an unchurched post christian culture people in our culture are not antichurch they simply view the church as irrelevant to their lives
8115220 each year 3 500 to 4 000 churches close their doors forever yet only 1 100 to 1 500 new churches are started
8115221 there is not a congregation that possesses the ability and the financial resources to attract reach and respond to the needs of all the residents of the community

8115223 would you like for me to seat you with him sir
8115224 he told me to come over and invite you to take a seat at his booth said you are an old friend that was meeting hime here
8115225 i think he is mistaken i am not here to meet with anyone
8115226 glad you could make it jonny boy good to see you in such health and cheer i was beginning to think that you were ignoring me i was thinking that you almost regreting coming in to visist
8115227 adam goodness i could have taken you for someone else funny to see you here i dont ever remember setting at time for us to catch up on things but nevertheless take a seat and tell me the latest
8115228 jonny you seem something the matter is with you expecting someone else along tonight you look a little feverish sudden what the jolly has you up on the pins son
8115229 nothing dear adam i just have a weird feeling is all seems as though someone is watching you know that feeling
8115230 ah most certainly most certainly you see back when i was in
8115231 work have you in the morn jonny tis no better time to endure the late air than with this beautiful thing we have for a barmaid and an old friend like you dont you say
8115232 must we bring you water from this rock numbers 20 10

8115234 1 john 4 1 while at the same time realizing that we are all works in progress
8115235 whoa wait what are you telling me you mean to say why would you are you kidding me
8115236 if x happens then y might happen and the result could possibly be z
8115237 this team is due to blow somebody out and i think its going to be tonight
8115238 you wanted a more lopsided score so we got a more lopsided score
8115239 its a game where defensively i dont think we were quite there
8115240 i dont think we had the energy or commitment level in the first half it looked like we had already played 45 minutes before the first whistle blew a team like columbus is going to punish you for that
8115241 our beat writer for the salt lake tribune didnt want this game as badly as that guy from the dispatch did
8115242 i dont want to say its easy but service like that makes it a lot easier
8115243 if i could get all of the votes that bcs family made for him i might have a chance
8115244 there arent any more cities in the league are there
8115245 i can talk to you about the dallas game if you want
8115246 thats the only thing we can think about and the only thing we have any control over right now
8115247 shawn heard me listening to a scottish folk band called runrig who play traditional and contemporary bagpipes
8115248 i recommend the band to anyone out there who just feels sometimes like they need to rock out to some bagpipes my friends and i back home used to love playing it max volume out the car as we drove so i still keep it up over here
8115249 i havent yet but if it would produce a clearer and louder sound for my bagpipes then it may be a good investment
8115250 i will look into it so watch out columbus if you hear the noise of bagpipes getting closer as youre walking about dont worry its just me driving in your neighborhood with runrig blasting out of my new speakers
8115251 duncan likes to listen and sing along to some band from new zealand
8115252 its decent but it just doesnt match up to the bagpipes and steve lenhart is well educated in speaking spanish and loves the gypsy kings but again its decent music but just not in the same league as the bagpipes
8115253 one of the most common questions i get asked when people find out im scottish is can you play the bagpipes
8115254 i would love to say yes but the truth is that i have never even tried my uncle will is the only one in my family who can play whenever he would stay at my house he would play his bagpipes at like 7 in the morning let me tell you that you cannot sleep through someone playing the bagpipes in the same house it is one loud instrument
8115255 and then she says mr mcdermott we can put you on a flight from newark to chicago to st louis and im thinking thats not too bad considering there are no direct flights
8115256 then she says or we can put you on a flight from newark to lax to st
8115257 so did you take the la flight think of all the magazine reading you could have done plus all the in flight movies you could have watched
8115258 maybe if you got on the la flight they would have given you a parachute
8115259 and a breathing apparatus since youd be at 38 000 feet
8115260 dont worry well be more than happy to give you a little push out of the plane
8115261 we had just watched west ham play liverpool at anfield
8115262 we were walking down this road to the team bus
8115263 so this guy is all excited that were with an mls team he is so drunk he can hardly stand or walk and for some unknown reason he has worn a brazil national team jersey to a liverpool match at anfield not only that but he wants us to autograph his brazil jersey
8115264 so this guy wants to have the columbus crew or maybe the chicago fire sign his brazil jersey but he has nothing to write with
8115265 the guy eventually comes back but does he have a sharpie no he has a ballpoint pen seriously a ballpoint pen we tell him a pen wont work that he needs to get a marker so he takes off again then he eventually comes back with another ballpoint pen we tell him again that a pen wont work and that he needs to get a sharpie
8115266 so what does the guy do he goes to the cop thats right near us the cop is on a horse he asks the cop if the cop has a sharpie
8115267 this cop is waaaay up there on a huge horse
8115268 the largest horse i have ever seen that wasnt pulling a budweiser wagon
8115269 ok then we signed his shirt i think i signed it brian mcbride doc signed it dr j and jason signed it carlos bocanegra since the guy kept calling us the fire and jason used to work for the fire when carlos was there the thing is you couldnt read any of what we wrote anyway because it was a pen basically all we did was ruin the guys brazil jersey with pen marks but he couldnt have been happier he was so excited it was so strange
8115270 you know its a blowout when the supporters are ignoring the game and chanting the name of an ex player
8115271 yes that year and a half at stanford paid off
8115272 i was little and my voice sounded exactly like it does now actually it never changed
8115273 he knows i still have a good relationship with the people up there and that it was the biggest game in their short existence i have some real good friendships with the players coaching staff and fans up there so it was great to see them win the championship in only their second year i was also disappointed that i didnt get to see us have a great victory over salt lake but i was getting score updates on the phone and enjoyed seeing the goals add up
8115274 cleveland won 2 1 but could have made it much more convincing with the chances they created
8115275 but they got the victory they deserved charlotte had a great season but couldnt produce it in the final they showed great respect to cleveland when the city stars picked up the winners trophy and that was great to see it was an enjoyable match and im very happy for the cleveland manager martin rennie who is a fellow scot
8115276 for anyone who watched the olympic opening ceremony they would have heard the bagpipes being played numerous times
8115277 thats an event us scots would have taken gold in bagpipes

8115292 the first known student use of the four year old dna barcoding technology in a public marketplace
8115293 in all cases as higher priced or more desirable species
8115294 shocking and abhorrent that the most vulnerable in society would be targeted in this manner
8115295 a key component of the strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of or who are experiencing educational disadvantage
8115296 simply unfathomable for a small financial rebate the department would jeopardise the future of scores of vulnerable young people around the country and effectively contribute to the problem of early school leaving
8115297 while you have authority to manage how such savings are achieved immediate steps must be taken to apply whatever restrictions are necessary to recruitment and other payroll costs that will deliver the full 3 per cent in 2009
8115298 in view of the overall pressures within which the 2009 estimates are being framed it can be anticipated that the 3 per cent saving target will be a minimum requirement to stay within allocation and such savings should be sustainable over the longer term
8115299 in that regard all possible further pay and non pay efficiency measures that can yield savings beyond the 3 per cent level should be identified
8115300 no man knows himself or can describe himself with fidelity but he can reveal himself

8115302 what the demand for equality of recognition implies is that when we strip all of a persons contingent and accidental characteristics away there remains some essential human quality underneath that is worth of a certain minimal level of respect
8115303 oh bless maybe this guy could be the one maybe he could father my children
8115304 on these sensitive issues i cannot take an immediate decision we will take inputs from intellectuals and come to a collective decision
8115305 this question of the real presence for me revolves around the concept of the timelessness of eternity i look at it this way from our perspective jesus died some 2 000 years ago but from gods perspective because he is outside time and space jesus is still on the cross and he has not yet gone to the cross because time is not linear in eternity jesus is the same yesterday today and forever because he is outside of linear time
8115306 jesus is the same yesterday today and forever because he is outside of linear time
8115307 if this were true which it is not it would make jesus a liar
8115308 also now jesus second coming has taken place in the form of the promisedmessiah 1835 1908 so in my opinion relevance of all such ideas doesnt remain valid there is no such thing as reincarnation this cannot be true
8115309 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being

8115319 god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
8115320 psalm 63 1 2 the psalmist is desperate to cleanse the inside of his vessel first not only first but early in the morning he longed for that encounter with the father every day so much so that he likened his heart to a dry and thirsty land yearning for the heavenly outpouring
8115321 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
8115322 how did you know i was looking for this where did you find one to replace it

8115334 you are interminably lost behind a disease for which there is no definition no cure and even no diagnosis you are a pretty plane through which the hand desires to pass but is stopped at a shimmering and cold as steel surface
8115335 you have this deed this quest you ride this high wave and in pretense you strut as if on a stallion and you hide forever in this charade you a man of honor you walk so proud and yet you never live at all so many would like to love you so many have probably tried and you and your disease will simply not let them in
8115336 the struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting
8115337 leader ruler often in the sense of a state other than his own
8115338 by russian social democrats from the late 1890s through the bolshevik revolution in 1917 15 this sense of hegemony as articulated by lenin referred to the leadership exercised by the proletariat over the other exploited classes
8115339 the class of modern capitalists owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour
8115340 the class of modern wage labourers who having no means of production of their own are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live
8115341 a legal and political forms which express existing real relations of production b forms of consciousness which express a particular class view of the world c a process in which over a whole range of activities men sic become conscious of a fundamental economic conflict and fight it out these three senses would direct our attention respectively to a institutions b forms of consciousness c political and cultural practices
8115342 spontaneous consent given by the great masses of the population to the general direction imposed on social life by the dominant fundamental group i
8115343 apparatus of state coercive power which legally enforces discipline on those groups who do not consent either actively or passively this apparatus is however constituted for the whole of society in anticipation of moments of crisis of command and direction when spontaneous consent has failed
8115344 state political society civil society in other words hegemony protected by the armor of coercion
8115345 state is the entire complex of practical and theoretical activities with which the ruling class not only justifies and maintains its dominance but manages to win the active consent of those over whom it rules
8115346 is not in reality constituted simply by the actual trenches but by the whole organizational and industrial system of the territory which lies to the rear of the army in the field
8115347 massive structures of the modern democracies both as state organizations and as complexes of associations in civil society constitute for the art of politics as it were the trenches and the permanent fortifications of the front in the war of position
8115348 when the state trembled a sturdy structure of civil society was at once revealed the state was only an outer ditch behind which there stood a powerful system of fortresses and earthworks
8115349 to raise the great mass of the population to a particular cultural and moral level a level or type which corresponds to the needs of the productive forces for development and hence to the interests of the ruling class
8115350 school as a positive educative function and the courts as a repressive and negative educative function
8115351 a multitude of other so called private initiatives and activities tend to the same end initiatives and activities which form the apparatus of the political and cultural hegemony of the ruling classes
8115352 educative pressure is applied to single individuals so as to obtain their consent and their collaboration turning necessity and coercion into freedom
8115353 must show in their specific internal life that they have assimilated as principles of moral conduct those rules which in the state are legal obligations in the parties necessity has already become freedom
8115354 type of collective society to which the entire mass must be educated
8115355 the imperial mission of educating and civilizing colonial subjects in the literature and thought of england
8115356 serv ing to strengthen western cultural hegemony in enormously complex ways
8115357 a sense of reality for most people in the society a sense of absolute because experienced reality beyond which it is very difficult for most members of the society to move in most areas of their lives
8115358 in its refusal to equate consciousness with the articulate formal system which can be and ordinarily abstracted as ideology
8115359 it does not just passively exist as a form of dominance it has continually to be renewed recreated defended and modified it is also continually resisted limited altered challenged by pressures not all its own
8115360 the decisive hegemonic function is to control or transform or even incorporate alternatives and opposition
8115361 the dominant culture so to say at once produces and limits its own forms of counter culture
8115362 it is misleading as a general method to reduce all political and cultural initiatives and contributions to the terms of the hegemony
8115363 authentic breaks within and beyond it have often in fact occurred
8115364 if we develop mode of analysis which instead of fixed positions are capable of discerning in good faith the of many actual initiatives and contributions
8115365 modern african thought seems somehow to be basically a product of the west
8115366 the colonial space is therefore an agonistic space despite the imitation and mimicry with which colonised peoples cope with the imperial presence the relationship becomes one of constant if implicit contestation and opposition
8115367 the relationship of developers and to be developed is constituted by the developers knowledge and categories
8115368 natural faculty or self evident procedure for the production of truth
8115369 the effects of extralocal and long term processes are only manifested locally and specifically produced in the actions of individuals living their particular lives inscribed in their bodies and their words
8115370 living in the same era subject to the same historical forces struggling with the same issues
8115371 a sort of primitive grace from which the modern world has fallen
8115372 far from the problematical intangibility of tradition ethnic consciousness reveals social change of which it is a matrix
8115373 i want to make pretend soup and i want to do it now

8115377 but ima take her back hoping that the shit stop
8115378 i cant believe were wasting taxpayer dollars and court resources on this case
8115379 i was told they had no information and no i couldnt see her someone would come talk to us soon an hour passed and i told them we had to know i could see it on their faces that something was wrong
8115380 we were told our only chance was to fly to musc in charleston and put her on an ecmo machine
8115381 we didnt know if she was going to go down the same road as paris
8115382 influenza a and b viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease almost every winter in the united states the flu can cause mild to severe illness and at times can lead to death
8115383 it was an absolute miracle we almost lost her twice while on ecmo the fluid built up in her lungs and the worry was as the end of the machine came it would just stop working
8115384 her right lung was opening but the left lung was not and we thought we lost the left lung a ct scan showed the lung tissue was still able to function
8115385 i was told by doctors they didnt know if she would make it through the night they told me to bring the family right away
8115386 she made it through the night and the next day started getting stronger
8115387 we can only attribute it all to prayer and god pulling off a miracle the doctors even said in 30 some years they have never had a patient as sick as her live
8115388 every week there are huge improvements and we reach big milestones the doctors originally thought she would need the trach for two years
8115389 we have had so much help from the community from people we dont even know one of the hardest things for us was to learn to accept help we never asked anybody people came by the droves it is how we have been able to make it
8115390 when all of this started we knew she was in trouble but never really knew how close to losing her we were our mindset when we went to columbia was we would probably be there a week but four and a half months later we came home
8115391 ok ok mr skeptic lets just assume youre right i will assume your worldview and using your own logic i will see how far i can go towards answering the philosophical problems of reality and knowledge
8115392 a representation usually on a flat surface of the whole or a part of an area
8115393 slow and often bitterly disputed recovery of geographical territory which is at the heart of decolonisation is preceded as empire had been by the charting of cultural territory
8115394 generally more crowded successive maps are not necessarily more truthful
8115395 cultural assimilation is the most effective form of political action
8115396 cultural domination works by consent and often precedes conquest by force
8115397 colonial schools sought to extend foreign domination and economic exploitation of the colony
8115398 education in colonies seems directed at absorption into the metropole and not separate and dependent development of the colonized in their own society and culture
8115399 never found one among them orientalists an opposing political group who could deny that a single shelf of a good european library was worth the whole native literature of india and arabia
8115400 it is no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in england
8115401 we must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern a class of persons indian in blood and colour but english in taste in opinions in morals and in intellect
8115402 annihilate s a people s belief in their names in their languages in their environment in their heritage of struggle in their unity in their capacities and ultimately in themselves it makes them see their past as one wasteland of non achievement and it makes them want to distance themselves from that wasteland it makes them want to identify with that which is furthest removed from themselves
8115403 education far from giving people the confidence in their ability and capacities to overcome obstacles or to become masters of the laws governing external nature as human beings tends to make them feel their inadequacies and their ability to do anything about the condition of their lives
8115404 to decolonize our minds we must not see our own experiences as little islands that are not connected with other processes
8115405 education as a means of mystifying knowledge and hence reality
8115406 the organization curriculum and language medium of these schools has aimed consistently at americanizing the american indian
8115407 if education was intended to permit native people mobility into the mainstream we must ask why in over three centuries it has been so remarkably unsuccessful
8115408 civilization and assimilation in the colonized schooling of native americans

8115411 what he knows about human feelings and that knowledge may exceed his entire personal experience
8115412 figures of speech are used to insinuate wrong ideas move the passions and thereby mislead the judgement
8115413 thinking adults must recover metaphorical abilities in order to intuit in order to make connections that reason may not generate
8115414 the artist who works in words and anecdotes images and facts wants to share with us nothing less than his digested life his life as he savors it in the memories and fantasies most precious however obscurely to him by authentic i mean actual and concrete for the creative imagination in my sense of it is wholly parasitic upon the real world what used to be called creation creative excitement and a sense of useful work have invariably and only come to me when i felt i was transferring with lively accuracy some piece of experienced reality the printed page
8115415 never meet because hes arguing from quantities and im arguing from values
8115416 literature not only sustains histqrical experience and continues a tradition it also through moral risk and formal experimentation and verbal humor transforms the conservative horizon of the readers and helps liberate us all from the determinism of prejudice doctrinal rigidity and barren repetition
8115417 the novel and poem by their very nature are anti totalitarian and therefore subversive and liberating

8115447 orang beriman itu tenteram hati mereka lantaran ingat kepada allah ketahuilah bahawa dengan mengingati allah itu mententeramkan jiwa
8115448 sesungguhnya orang beriman itu ialah mereka yang apabila disebut nama allah takutlah hati mereka dan apabila dibacakan kepada mereka ayat nya kian bertambah iman mereka dan kepada tuhan mereka berserah diri
8115449 orang beriman dan beramal soleh adalah kebahagiaan bagi mereka dan tempat kembali yang baik

8115557 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8115558 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8115559 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8115560 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8115561 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8115562 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8115563 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth

8115570 there are too many choices in hong kong and the pace is so fast that people forget things easily no one stops and looks around or thinks and looks inside their hearts
8115571 you can feel the connection between people and the gratitude that they have towards life but in this city you seem to forget the closeness among each other
8115572 some people think i am crazy but it seems that i have two identities one is ella a normal hongkonger which goes to work while the other identity is an indian who loves the culture and practices of the traditional indian dance and yoga
8115573 he told me that he was a mime artist at the local theatre mime group
8115574 teaching yoga is not easy but there are no politics to deal with i have more freedom and i can share my passion with others
8115575 rather than focusing on peoples faults and weaknesses we should appreciate others for what they are good at
8115576 i have learned how to detach myself in certain situations to have an objective view balance and compromise with different parties to work things out especially at the office
8115577 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8115578 im not in any way trying to promote my qualifications or to dissuade others of my disqualifications to serve on a mccain ticket

8115580 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process

8115585 it would be tough for average joes to beat a couple of yankees at baseball but slamming them in a game of beer pong was no sweat last week
8115586 the fans gave them a beating toward the end chamberlain and giambi got really competitive but it wasnt enough
8115587 tom is the way he is hes not going to change and thats fine
8115588 just as its his prerogative to coach that way and treat people the way he does its my prerogative to do something else and give you a reason why
8115589 if i was lying if i said tom was a great guy that he said tiki i know youre hurt take a day off or if we screwed up he didnt yell at me and said ok tiki with positive reinforcement then id be lying and id be wrong
8115590 coughlin robbed me of what had been one of the most important things i had in my life which was the joy i felt playing football

8115593 i feel great joy for them because i know in a lot of ways i helped a lot of guys on that team
8115594 i know brandon jacobs was someone who benefited from me being there even criticizing someone is a way of getting them to think about themselves
8115595 elis got a strong arm i know hes been really maligned this year you watch him on film it seems like hes going through a process the right way making the right decisions sometimes he just throws some bad balls

8115618 all it would take to stop the wrecking ball is for the new york city landmarks preservation commission to agree to consider our proposal
8115619 i am sure that once they investigate and hold hearings they will be reminded of the national historic significance of the building and the potential for productive future use how could they not agree that the house that ruth built must be saved

8115623 the hall which is privately owned now draws only 350 000 visitors a year a tiny number
8115624 yankee stadium is where the modern game took hold what was started by ruth and gehrig the great players my father saw as a boy continued on through the decades with bill dickey and joe dimaggio i can recall taking the elevated subway train down to the stadium to watch mickey mantle whitey ford and yogi berra play during the 1960s and years later my sons rooted for don mattingly dave winfield and bernie williams great players like derek jeter alex rodriguez and mariano rivera are continuing the tradition today all steeped in the great history began here by babe ruth
8115625 i believe that senator biden fits very well with the decision making method that ive laid out for senator obama
8115626 based on my preliminary grading of how well he accomplishes each of the sets of criteria i believe senator obama should be applauded for the way he approached and made this important decision
8115627 by approaching the decision in a rational and sensible way one that assigns an appropriate level of importance to each of the criteria senators obama and mccain can show the american public that they can make decisions that are for the good of the nation not just for political reasons
8115628 my decision autopsy shows that senator obama correctly chose to assign greater value to leadership ability and experience rather than assistance with electoral college votes when he selected fellow senator biden as a running mate

8115874 boeings strategic thinking is probably second to no one on things like this
8115875 i have no doubt in my mind that the strategy will weigh just as much as the technical or political considerations
8115876 youve got family back at home and its always nice for them to see you in the starting lineup and stuff like that but we do a lot of rotating so were going to play a lot either way
8115877 whichever guy you ever pick to start the other guys right there
8115878 itll be significant to the guy but it wont be that significant to us
8115879 the one good thing is that we both like the discovery channel
8115880 there was only one tv in the apartment we both like the discovery channel and we both like to eat
8115881 kedric needs to be brushed up on fundamentals and things like that
8115882 he doesnt need to be told to go hard he goes hard monty goes hard as well weve just got to get him to do it on a consistent basis all the time thats something he would agree with himself hes got to do it all the time because he does have talent
8115883 i dont agree with it i feel like every time i put my hand down i want to go out and give it all ive got
8115884 i look at it as two guys trying to win football games it just so happens were two defensive linemen
8115885 i assumed i was going to be redshirted so thats why i wanted to play defense to have fun
8115886 i didnt know i would pick it up that well playing on the defensive side of the ball but it worked out well
8115887 im grateful for it its going to help me out later on in my career
8115888 i tried to tell him we really needed a fullback and we had a lot of defensive ends
8115889 he said i dont care i want to play defensive end in two weeks he was a starter at defensive end and hes been a starter for four straight years
8115890 he was asking to go over to the offense on goal line situations
8115891 he gets better every year hes gotten better bigger stronger faster
8115892 hes a tough opponent when the time comes hes definitely going to be able to perform hes going to cause a lot of havoc out there
8115893 hes just a laid back guy hes cool easy to get along with
8115894 i like to hang with him sometimes when i get a chance hes a good guy
8115895 smashing telly is a hand edited collection of the best free instantly available tv on the web
8115896 im just trying to finish this season strong and hopefully get in the playoffs im 0 0 in my mind after every start i try to go out there and not really pay attention to that
8115897 i wasnt really thinking about it i was just trying to go out and get people out i went long in the game and at least saved a couple of guys in the bullpen
8115898 this kid is an animal you see him throw in the bullpen session and he is a strong kid and he has the same pace and concentration in the game this kid has a chance to have a good career
8115899 he changed speeds and threw three pitches for strikes his fastball his slider and curveball
8115900 his curveball is a great strikeout pitch he moved the ball around pitched to contact he did a good job
8115901 it definitely didnt start out how i wanted it to

8115906 anger management is not just for angry people it is for those interested in improving skills to make their relationships better with others
8115907 we have created several anger management courses to meet the needs of a variety of populations that span well beyond what is typically thought of when we think of having an anger problem
8115908 at the completion of any of our high quality programs we expect clients to feel they have gained new knowledge to makes their lives better

8115939 there are things you can do with algae that you cant do with crops
8115940 very importantly you can harvest the algae every day of the year
8115941 with crops its a seasonal thing algae has a strategic advantage with algae if you have a failure you can generally get the system back up in a week and restart it
8115942 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8115943 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8115944 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8115945 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8115946 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8115947 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8115948 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8115949 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8115950 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8115951 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8115952 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions

8115957 these converter boxes are all capable of handling their basic function reasonably well and theyll enable you to use an analog tv after the switch to all digital broadcasts still if you want optimal picture quality from digital broadcasts youd be better off buying a decent digital tv
8115958 we obviously dont want to have fewer viewers weve been involved in educating the public about this for years it is what it is
8115959 i dont know if its an issue of converter box quality as much as its an issue of antennas
8115960 there are so many variables reception quality depends on where youre located whether youre in an apartment building or a single family home with an antenna on the roof when you hook up the converter box youve got to make sure youve got a proper antenna if you dont youll either see nothing or it will look pixelated
8115961 no there is no software update that is how the box is supposed to operate
8115962 why did they even put a guide on the box

8115986 terrorism in whatever form is not accepted by kazakhstan we condemn it in the strongest possible terms there is no justification for it we have supported all anti terrorism initiatives be it by the united states or any other country kazakhstan s support for such initiatives can be assessed by the fact that this country krygistan allowed the u s to use its airspace to reach afghanistan to tackle the taliban and al qaeda immediately after 9 11 kazakhstan also has an arrangement with the nato to provide humanitarian aid this is a very important part of our ties with the u s there are other areas also where we collaborate such as border management immigration processes and combating drug trafficking
8115987 we would like to diversify our contacts in the field of security we have a small military unit whose responsibility is to help kazakhstan s partners in their time of need we are proud of this partnership

8115989 there seems to be an almost overt hostility to cyclists not only from many motorists but more importantly from the planners and highway engineers who create the street environment
8115990 its a combination of factors ranging from overcrowding on public transport to the imposition of the congestion charge
8115991 but undoubtedly the initial trigger was a pro cycling attitude from local authorities who in the past had been negative or even hostile to cycling as are some politicians in australia

8116007 traditionally massively parallel databases were able to parallelize ordinary sql but had limitations when parallelizing more general programs whether written as user defined functions or a database programming language such as pl sql
8116008 in many cases these capabilities simply ran on a single node of an mpp database now analysts and developers can take advantage of the power of mapreduce from within ordinary sql by creating sql mr functions in java python r and more
8116009 good examples are bayesian machine learning approaches clustering algorithms and natural language processing

8116025 you can entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience
8116026 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief tucker bounds spokesman for senaotr mccain said

8116057 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8116058 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy

8116072 madonna seems to be an extraordinarily brilliant business woman in the business of culture
8116073 shes controlled her controversy so every time shes been in controversy it does her good not bad
8116074 outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy
8116075 the whole notion of a democratic republic is that this wasnt just about politicians that anyone could shoot their mouth off about whatever they wanted to
8116076 were in a sad situation if were turning to entertainers for political wisdom
8116077 increased profit was driven by stronger production andhigher commodity prices which outweighed the negative impactof the strong australian dollar and increased productioncosts
8116078 were not opposed to this post office coming to oak creek but we havent been satisfied with the solution that the only place this can go is in our backyard
8116079 is delphi an option i dont know but have we truly investigated that as a primary place
8116080 the only thing i can see that the city of oak creek is going to get out of this is that we might sell a few cheesebugers or we might sell a little gas
8116081 id like to see an itemized list of what benefits the city of oak creek is going to get out of this
8116082 these are favourable for the market but i doubt ifinvestors are willing to continue buying treasuries given thatyields are already low
8116083 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8116084 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8116086 coscos strategy to increase its exposure to chinasdomestic market and intra asia trade paid off
8116087 in the past if someone told me they were worried about the economy i would have told them to have six months of cash flow needs as an emergency fund but right now i would do 12 months
8116088 and i would have a plan for how i could withdraw an additional 24 months from investments that are stable and where selling in a moment of need wont result in a big loss
8116089 at some point the economic cycle will change and things will go back to where people need a smaller cushion but right now its as much psychological as financial and if you dont have enough set aside youre going to be a lot more nervous
8116090 in a good economy or a bad economy as such if we thought three months of expenses in an emergency fund was appropriate two years ago it should be sufficient now unless you believe that something else has changed
8116091 we usually recommend three to six months of expenses depending on how stable someones income stream is
8116092 i think its kind of extreme to keep one to three years of cash flow in a money market fund but i think at that level you consider it part of the portfolio
8116093 it depends on how you want to look at it it takes so long for some people to amass a few months of expenses that they dont want to separate it from the rest of their savings
8116094 what people dont do is play what if and figure out how they would actually go about liquidating their holdings if they had an emergency
8116095 you need to have a plan so that in a typical portfolio you would first access the cash and then have some short term or intermediate bond funds to backstop those cash flow needs especially at a time when selling out of stocks could be very damaging
8116096 you have to decide what you are liquidating or if you will borrow against your 401 k or on a home equity line you have to think about whether borrowing will actually create more problems for you down the line and you need to do it before you have a problem
8116097 families need to define emergencies how much they need to set aside to be comfortable whether they want or need to increase those savings now because they dislike the economy or they are having worries about their job and how they will act if and when something bad actually happens
8116098 is to worry about it enough to know that you can get by if a problem happens to you
8116099 launching a war or revolution on the basis of a cause that seems justified to those starting it but which has little or no hope of success indeed without strong grounds for expecting a good outcome after the inevitable loss of life on all sides is taken into account is not glorious but criminally reckless
8116100 i do not know how he is a professor but anyway he purports to be an economist
8116101 the odd quiggan is good mental exercise all part of lifes rich tapestry et al
8116102 quiggin strikes me as the stereotype of an australian joyful hearty and not particularly aware of his own strength
8116103 his chief delight was drinking cups of coffee at odd hours
8116104 i came to the convention as a pledged hillary delegate and i remain a hillary delegate until the vote is official
8116105 now when this is over and we have our candidate then i will support that candidate
8116106 i think that texas politicians down ticket are going to suffer because shes not on the ticket
8116107 but as sen clinton has said you know i do not approve of that message she approves of the idea of coming together
8116108 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare

8116112 gustav is moving back over water and is expected to regainhurricane strength on wednesday once it clears the southwesternpeninsula of haiti
8116113 why does god let bad things happen to good people
8116114 but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is christ therefore a minister of sin certainly not 18if i rebuild what i destroyed i prove that i am a lawbreaker 19for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for god 20i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me 21i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness could be gained through the law christ died for nothing

8116123 you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8116124 she will do what she has to do for the party she is a graceful lady
8116125 as i recall president clinton and the democrats have done it before
8116126 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8116127 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y
8116128 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8116129 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8116130 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place
8116131 warga sebagian besar sudah tahu dari lsm dan beberapa komponen sosial masyarakat warga mendukung pemberian status tersebut
8116132 tapi janji tidak ditepati malah warga disodorkan cash and resettlement prosesnya juga berlarut larut pemerintah juga tidak dalam posisi membela korban harusnya pemerintah mengeluarkan kebijakan yang keras dengan lapindo

8116134 ayo turun turun biar semuanya selamat kita ikut pak polisi saja
8116135 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8116136 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8116137 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8116138 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8116139 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8116140 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8116141 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8116142 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8116143 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8116144 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8116145 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8116146 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports
8116147 zal can do no wrong the vice president is growing weary of his unpredictability but the president thinks hes still a rock star
8116148 i was on the phone today with asif zardari and he mentioned that he was going to be in dubai on september 2 to meet with you
8116149 can i ask what sort of advice and help are you providing
8116150 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the deals
8116151 he was traveling to london to see them having dinner with them in new york
8116152 this is pioneering a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of free speech with the right to reputation
8116153 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8116154 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8116155 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8116156 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8116157 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped
8116158 i promise you if you ask the russians they will give you a long litany of things where they think they have cooperated with us and we havent given much in return
8116159 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8116160 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8116161 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8116162 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8116163 you cant stop somebody from nairobi from reading it its on the web theyre going to notice and say id quite like to do that i can do that and they apply to come well that is terrific
8116164 its pretty good for coffs harbour its pretty good for the person in nairobi
8116165 its empowering people and the character of people movement is going to change and its essentially going to be an enhancing and enriching thing both economically and socially
8116166 some people dont like that and are really worried about it and i have to say to them its going to be very disappointing century
8116167 the key opportunity to get out of poverty is to move and go somewhere else
8116168 it always has been a crucial part of australias history its becoming very difficult and the debate on migration is very much looking at migration as a threat and not as an opportunity
8116169 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8116170 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8116171 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8116172 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8116173 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8116174 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter

8116207 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
8116208 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8116209 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8116210 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8116211 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
8116212 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself
8116213 to get a kick out of smoking industrial hemp it would take a cigar the size of a telephone pole
8116214 i guess i would just make a plea saying we need the money you know we need the money on roads
8116215 i dont think we should let the threat of a lawsuit force us to implement something thats not well thought out
8116216 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has

8116239 i give up i dont want to feel this pain anymore i dont want to know how many sick children need a home and have been waiting for 8 years
8116240 there is always more always something else to discover about the wonder and majesty and sincerity of our creator there is no arrival we are all on our own journey and we need to share our journey with others
8116241 when you discover that you are riding a dead horse the best strategy is to dismount
8116242 its good for the wexford squad that he has treated them with disdain in that it helps motivate them but i dont think its good for the gaa in general or indeed the media
8116243 what wexford have achieved is quite remarkable and they deserve credit for it not negativity some of joe brollys comments show an arrogance bordering on the objectionable
8116244 they should be showing more respect in wexfords case they deserve a more objective analysis than theyve got
8116245 even when i mention the silver it kills me its killing me today
8116246 the gold was on my fingertips it will haunt me but i have a silver medal so i cant be too bad

8116250 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8116251 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama
8116252 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8116253 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8116254 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
8116255 you know we only need urine samples when youre pregnant right

8116326 choosing someone like mike huckabee would indicate an abandonment of limited government free market principles sorry huckabee supporters thats the quote however picking someone like eric cantor who has tried to help the republican party reclaim the mantel of fiscal conservatism could make the difference between victory and defeat for economic conservatives eric cantor would be a good choice

8116331 its really frustrating that we have this incident of violence now
8116332 theres been hundreds of contacts with officers that have gone very well we may have an isolated instance here and there and the department is committed to fully looking into those instances and if its deemed inappropriate well take the appropriate actions

8116354 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8116355 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8116356 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force
8116357 its absurd and disingenuous for the obama campaign to say we are running this ad they are trying to blame us and use a straw man to take this issue off the table if he thinks having a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist is not an issue that concerns the american people he is deluding himself or being naive

8116382 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
8116383 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
8116384 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
8116385 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
8116386 the good news about our water is its not going anywhere even with extensive farming our groundwater hasnt been pulled away from us
8116387 nah im just im just not feeling too well right now im just going to take a shower and go to sleep
8116388 there is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected
8116389 public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed in an era of abundance
8116390 well be trying to change our water laws in the context that the west is now
8116391 there is no water and theyre trying to apportion droplets
8116392 theyre in the terrible position of trying to judge between needs that are all critical with not enough resources

8116394 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
8116395 and if you know me at all that would be disturbing in so many levels i cant even begin to say
8116396 it felt real good to be back out there on the field with the guys and to get in there and make a couple of plays
8116397 i didnt feel too rusty but i was kind of anxious to be back out there and to get in a situation to make plays so that i could test my body out
8116398 the offense is based on trust the quarterbacks trust that we are going to be at the right place at the right time and as receivers we have to trust that the quarterback is going to get the ball where it needs to be
8116399 regardless of who is back there the trust factor is the same for me its just my job to be where im supposed to be
8116400 there are definitely a lot of weapons and through training camp weve done nothing but gotten better
8116401 guys are getting back this week and coming into this last week its just a matter of really tuning in and fixing the last little mistakes so that we are ready for week one

8116414 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8116415 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8116446 he did a good job went through the individual today took a couple of the other plays so well see how he is jeff ferguson just spoke to him so well see how he is inside that would be a good thing if he was able to
8116447 i hope so he took some reps today if we can get him15 20 snaps or so in the game thatd be really good
8116448 he looks like hes enjoying himself thats good i know hes excited about the offense hes had real good communication with mike martz about his role in the offense way back from the time i even hired mike i think its one thing to communicate about it its another when all of a sudden you see that its happening i think that pleases frank and obviously that pleases us all because hes a real key integral part of what we do i think thats why you see him bubbly like he is
8116449 i havent noticed any difference i havent noticed anything hes been very positive throughout training camp i think he recognizes that hes getting better the communications been good not only with me but with mike martz as well
8116450 im not looking to get into the quarterback needs to believe hes the quarterback without question the other guys need to be ready at all times because you never know the other guy could be out getting a shoelace fixed so they have to be ready to go in but other than that weve named our starter and thats that everyone including our backup quarterbacks im hopeful are pulling for him to do a great job because the better he does the better we are but again everybody has to stay ready
8116451 right now jeff ulbrichs working with the first group takeo spikes is doing a real good job right now weve got about two or three different packages of defense whether its 3 4 4 3 or the sub package so theres a little bit to learn for takeo when a guy holds out if he goes back to the place he was at its an easy transistion for an older player but obviously hes got a little catching up to do because he held out of camp hes making real good progress hes going to contribute in one way or another im not sure what it will be yet
8116452 id have to go back and look at the film i cant answer that right on the money i like what i see with where hes at right now i do hes a more mature person naturally all of us would be after a couple of years its hard to answer that question
8116453 right now i would say right now the one that comes to mind would be the offense obviously im just going off of preseason if i compare preseason this preseason to last years preseason and be specific with that because the regular season is a whole nother game then we are much improved there last year i know we struggled throughout the preseason offensively this year weve made some plays weve had our share of not so good plays but weve made a lot of good plays so that would be the area other than that theres really none that i would comment on
8116454 i would hope so thus far in preseason again comparing them to preseason a year ago although theyve been banged up they have done a better job than last years group i cant remember if we were banged up in the preseason or not as far as that position goes banged up or not the group has done a good job
8116455 i think its always player on player first matchups would be first and then the second thing would obviously be the scheme that could entail coverage it could entail rush
8116456 thats a good question were still in the process of learning that what i like is his style of play is the same wherever he is hes very physical and hes very good i wouldnt call him a finesse edge rusher like some guys are but those kind of guys also cant do the other things that he does so well they dont the run typically as well as he does either so right now i think he can rush both inside and outside and thats what weve been doing with him
8116457 if youve got somebody that takes a down off which everybodys got a breaking breaking point has been not nearly as frequent as some guys
8116458 well try to but at the same time like i said well move him around as you already mentioned
8116459 i dont know if hes full go obviously youre talking about a physical thing nothing else i would like to get him some play this week he needs to play when it comes to him thats really what im thinking about more than anything else hell play some
8116460 like i said we are in a preseason guys i dont want to jump ahead weve got san diego this week and thats all we are going to talk about and we arent going to talk about anything else its a short term focus for us completely and i dont want to get way out there thats a mistake
8116461 san diego is very similar they are a 3 4 team so theres an awful lot of similarities so weve been basically working against each other this week and tomorrow will curtail some things in the short goal line area for the opponent but other than that weve done a lot of work this week against one another
8116462 well if it started today hed be the guy so well see where he is in a week but today he would
8116463 yes weve had zero discussions about alex not being on this football team
8116464 yeah it is you make a lot of money too they dont talk about getting rid of you are they theres been no talk
8116465 lets not deal with the hypothetical im confident i know this much you need quarterbacks to win games not just one you need a number of them and im confident in all three of the guys itd make me nervous to lose a guy if thats the case but again we have had no discussions
8116466 right now shaun is working in the third group but again that doesnt mean i have less confidence in shaun i was there last year and you guys were there too and he did a real nice job so thats good
8116467 could i see weeks tell me how its going to happen right now they kind of are set how they are well work from there

8116472 originally we were talking about going with a realtor but we found out how much savings wed have by selling it on our own
8116473 people would have open houses every sunday and there would be a lot of traffic up this road and a lot of people would stop by the house and grab a flyer and call us and want to look at the house
8116474 we have statistics from our national association that show using a realtor results in you getting more money for the final sale of your home the increase you get on that sale more than makes up for fees and commissions in using a realtor
8116475 a lot of things involved are legal contracts disclosures property condition disclosures and whatnot that the realtors have knowledge about and can help you get through that process with relative ease rather than having to do it themselves
8116476 i would definitely try selling it on your own for a few months and if you get to crunch time use a realtor then
8116477 weve launched a world stage this year our desire has always been to be across generations across denominations and across cultures
8116478 people have different tastes and different styles and anyone thats traveled around the world picks that up that there is not one specific style thats related to christianity
8116479 it is about the message that jesus christ brought that he said for god so loved the world that he gave his only son and for us its about that message and being relevant with that message so we do that in a variety of ways and a variety of styles

8116493 i know but id like to change that soon hopefully yeah we all flirt with the tiniest notion of self conclusion in one simplified motion see the trick is that you are never supposed to act on it no matter how unbearable this misery gets i would be lying if i said that things would never get rough and all this clich motivation it could never be enough i could stand here all night trying to convince you but what good would that do my offer stands and you must choose
8116494 alright you win but i only give you one night to prove yourself to be better than my attempt at flight i swear to god if you hurt me i will leap i will toss myself from these very cliffs and youll never see it coming
8116495 settle precious i know what youre going through because ten minutes before you got here i was gonna jump too yeah we all flirt with the tiniest notion of self conclusion in one simplified motion see the trick is that you are never supposed to act on it no matter how unbearable this misery gets

8116499 she is going through the leanest patch of her career and she expected adi to stand by her
8116500 but seeing her sagging brand value adi chose to concentrate on what sells rather than his obligations to a friend
8116501 when adi confronted rani over it all her frustration burst out and she answered back bluntly stating she has no control over what media chose to write their argument spiraled increasingly out of control with rani accusing adi of being a changed person
8116502 after they quit slanging they stopped talking to each other a few days later when rani visited yash raj studios on an errand she avoided adi who was present in the studio premises at that time

8116507 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8116567 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted this is a serious warning a warning to all and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
8116568 as this next generation workforce get recruited into your company they expect to use the equipment and applications that theyre used to
8116569 they have a deep affinity to social networking they have loyalty to their mobile devices over corporate issued equipment and they have an instinct to share information that poses a challenge for us said craig scroggie vice president pacific region symantec

8116578 mom he is the biggest teacher in the world he can even touch the ceiling he is like 9 feet tall
8116579 its a continuation of this trend that eyeballs are going to other places on the internet and advertisers are recognizing that
8116580 peaceful rallies across the country to register strong protest against the repeated attacks
8116581 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a
8116582 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8116583 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8116584 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8116585 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8116586 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8116587 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8116588 my friends it is time to take back the country we love whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8116589 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8116590 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8116591 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas we need a president who understands that we cant solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy
8116592 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation and less affordable health care more high gas prices and less alternative energy more jobs getting shipped overseas and fewer jobs created here more skyrocketing debt home foreclosures and mounting bills that are crushing our middle class families more war less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged come first and everyone else comes last
8116593 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8116599 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8116600 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8116601 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8116602 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8116603 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8116604 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8116605 and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally brothers whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the god of peace will be with you
8116606 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the ppl in this country who feel invisible
8116607 it makes sense to me that next week george bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre hard to tell apart
8116608 keep going before we can keep going weve got to get going and elect barack obama as the next president of the united states
8116609 never give in never give in never never never never in nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense

8116637 but streams that run for a long distance above ground gradually gather for themselves somewhat of the soil through which they flow
8116638 sermons and books are well enough but streams that run for a long distance above ground gradually gather for themselves somewhat of the soil through which they flow and they lose the cool freshness with which they started from the spring head truth is sweetest where it breaks from the smitten rock for at its first gush it has lost none of its heavenliness and vitality it is always best to drink at the well and not from the tank you shall find that reading the word of god for yourselves reading it rather than notes upon it is the surest way of growing in grace

8116726 well when it comes to things like extra marital relations people justify their sins by saying theyre in love the bible is clear on these things but emotion reigns supreme in this world take a man marrying a man for instance
8116727 does it say in the bible that men shouldnt marry grandpa
8116728 the column i wrote referenced romans chapter 1 so if your want to know more read the bible and learn from god youre old enough to discern right from wrong arent you
8116729 i understand what its saying grandpa especially in verse 26 and 27 but why would the editor leave that part out it seems so important
8116730 son it all comes down to making money the newspaper dont want to print something that might offend a reader because that would lower sells thats the first lesson on writing money rules all even editors and publishers
8116731 that dont matter no more son the bible says lots of stuff and no one cares
8116732 nothing cept keep writing for god and keep trusting him to guide my words
8116733 sure you can id be delighted but remember you might never get on the page

8116737 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy

8116739 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial strategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together

8116769 incorporates some twangy country picking with a little bit of hard core electric jamming to produce a quite effective song of heartbreak and personal regret
8116770 self penned by jimmy is written about a poor boy who observes the wealthy world around him with envy
8116771 although quite romantic sounds thrown together and a little bunched up in jimmys attempt to woo his lover
8116772 also comes off a little drug on and confusing at times making it quite easy to ignore and pass over for the next track
8116773 is actually quite inspiring but leans the album a little to far towards the personal scars that jimmy has faced
8116774 is also decent in its own right but again focuses towards a cliched message that is also slightly over the top
8116775 and dimine them to mach the style of this album wrong those two songs were perfect as they were and were among the best on his first album this time around they come off a little show offish and overdone in many parts while underdone instrumentally

8116806 i thought she was a class act she defended her campaign she did it all
8116807 that was her best speech ever and had the crowd in her hand im not shocked that she would do the minimum for obama because the clintons have always been about themselves there was no poetry in it then how could it be her best speech her speech was of somebody who is coming back i like that part this is somebody who is saying im a presence she tacked herself on to everything she said about obama he was almost an accessory to her but as i say what do you expect from the clintons
8116808 she showed herself to be shockingly good in marshaling her own strengths she looked really strong and there were probably some people in the audience wondering if perhaps they picked the wrong candidate

8116825 obama is running to restore that fair shot for every american for far too many americans that fair shot is becoming a long shot
8116826 these threats were more severe and more threatening because of the policies of this administration the president never tapped into our greatest resource the character and resolve of the american people
8116827 we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8116828 in 4 months we will have an administration that actually believes in science
8116829 if we rebuild our military and alliances we can restore americas leadership around the world
8116830 barack obama knows we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground who appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but who appeal to us first and foremost as americans

8116836 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8116837 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last 8 years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8116838 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8116843 are the reasons that i am supporting barack obama for president
8116844 there are no limits to what is possible in america
8116845 we need a president who understands that the genius of america has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class
8116846 government must be about we the people not we the favored few
8116847 just think of what america will be i cannot wait to watch barack obama sign into law a health care program that covers every single american
8116848 she will be a great first lady for ameria americans are fortunate that joe biden will be at barack obamas side
8116849 we dont need 4 more of the last 8 years

8116856 perhaps hoping to turn a fresh page from the democratic convention advisers to sen john mccain are considering a thursday night vice presidential announcement
8116857 although the unofficial word from campaign headquarters is that friday is still more likely
8116858 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8116859 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8116860 still got some twists and turns between now and november
8116861 theres not much doubt where the momentum is coming from 69 of voters in the state have seen the television ads about elizabeth doles 93 ranking for effectiveness in the us senate and among those folks hagan has an even wider 45 39 lead doles saving grace is voters who dont watch much tv she leads 45 34 with those who have not seen the ad
8116862 one of two things is going to have to happen for obama to win the state hes going to have to up his share of the white vote probably by bringing out voters under 30 in extreme record numbers or hes going to need black voters to turn out at a rate disproportionate to their representation in the overall population something that would be virtually unprecedented
8116863 will be dominated by the same two people who dominated the democratic party for the last generation and who have come to denver in much different roles than they wanted she speaks tuesday its his turn wednesday
8116864 for the clintons the politics of the week are simple accept the cheers of the many democrats who still support them be lavish in their praise for obama make sure that if he loses no one can say it was because they were covertly rooting for that result
8116865 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a tossup in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start
8116866 that at least three people were under arrest on firearms and drug charges in connection with a possible plot to kill sen barack obama during his speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination on thursday night
8116867 it was not clear how well along the possible plot was or whether the people under arrest had found a way to overcome the heavy security surrounding the democratic convention
8116868 has become a best selling title in the very brief time since barack obama the democrats presumptive presidential nominee announced that mr biden would be his running mate the book was released by random house last summer shortly after mr biden announced he was running for president but initial sales were unimpressive that was then as of sunday afternoon the book was at no 31 on the amazon com bestseller list and no 11 on barnes amp nobles list
8116869 a political convention has become an anachronism the glory days of smoke filled rooms delegates in funny hats and suspenseful roll call votes are gone conventions are now excuses for both parties to bludgeon the television networks into running four nights of political infomercials the elaborate and seemingly endless negotiations over whether hillary clinton will get a full roll call vote on wednesday night or whether the balloting will quickly be broken off for an obama by acclamation confetti drop illustrate how ridiculously ritualized the whole quadrennial spectacle has become so in a sense every reporter in denver is on the television beat and the journalistic danger lies in confusing the attitudes of the studio audience the delegates with the sentiments of nielsen families the voters

8116896 we originally were approached in late november and early december and we decided to take the job because the father had actually taken the kids to a war zone
8116897 there was a kitty we used for expenses there were five to six team members but in the end i came home with a six figure debt
8116898 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8116899 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8116900 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier

8116907 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech
8116908 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
8116909 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
8116910 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
8116911 what we set out to do last night i think was accomplished in a very very big way
8116912 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
8116913 my vote is a protest vote i live in ohio i know our votes count in a very special way because whoever wins ohio is often the person who becomes the president of the united states and i do not want to reward the democratic party with my vote i am disgusted with them
8116914 i feel like the democrats have not been practicing democracy
8116915 i have been a democrat for 30 years and have voted the party all the way down to dogcatcher not so this year
8116916 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8116917 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8116918 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8116919 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8116920 what we set out to do last night i think was accomplished in a very very big way
8116921 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8116922 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
8116923 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8116924 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
8116925 what we set out to do last night i think was accomplished in a very very big way
8116926 obama is just a regular guy whose mama was once on food stamps for 5 minutes before his bank vice president granny sent him to a private school in hawaii
8116927 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8116928 all ill say to that is that i have one less house than john kerry
8116929 fight for obama but first i want to honor the votes that were cast for clinton
8116930 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8116931 id say bills message is not even coded its a clear statement that obama cant deliver and mccain can

8116941 obama has a problem if he cant even get all the people in the convention hall together
8116942 he says repubs have this info but probably will not do anything until he is nominated
8116943 look i know about the race card i know about race im african american and it was obama who played the race card and its going to come back and bite obama in the butt
8116944 are proud yes i understand that but you want someone who can

8116952 wigwag gloria made my 10 best list of the idiot of the world about 2 weeks ago she comes in at about 6
8116953 quick call lands end they didnt ship the persimmon and the logan
8116954 somehow the dems have been able in their infinite wisdom to take the woman who won 18 million votes over the last year and make sure she isnt the 1 or 2 on the ticket
8116955 you arent going to win anyone over if you call them
8116956 im not trying to win anyone over im trying to win an argument
8116957 certain media outlets during the primary acted like obama was the messiah
8116958 somehow the dems have been able in their infinite wisdom to take the woman who won 18 million votes over the last year and make sure she isnt the 1 or 2 on the ticket
8116959 how about the people that would of voted for barack shouldnt their votes be counted
8116960 wigwag they didnt have hillary in that poll why not
8116961 in my own life in my own small way i have tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
8116962 see thats why i left a job at a big law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
8116963 barack obama believes in a fair shot for all americans
8116964 finally we have an unconfirmed report from inside the pepsi center that hillary is going to make an important announcement tonight
8116965 seriously on august 26th 2008 at 10 05 pm said don t worry wigwag its probably just a rumor what could she announce
8116966 rd you are going to demand they re introduce the era in the next congress
8116967 equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex
8116968 oh i havent played with them in a while cute little things
8116969 the time spent in a meeting an item is inversely proportional to its value up to a limit
8116970 the question i want to ask the publishing association is why a group that publishes scholarly journals feels the need to go this route
8116971 private sector non profit and commercial publishers serve researchers and scientists by managing and funding the peer review process disseminating authors work investing in technology and preserving millions of peer reviewed articles as part of the permanent record of science
8116972 finland finland finland the country where i quite want to be finland finland finland its the country for me youre so near to russia so far from japan quite a long way from cairo lots of miles from vietnam
8116973 dear so and so i believe ms smith should be promoted on the grounds that i recommend she should be promoted because i say so
8116974 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he made in 2002
8116975 allowed the studios to provide in quantity a product needed in quantity
8116976 the right of exhibitors to cancel 10 of the product is futile
8116977 because it is perfectly easy for the producers to put in 10 of films which the exhibitors are certain to reject before reaching the objectionable ones
8116978 the old hollywood studios had far more leeway to make an uncommercial film because even the smallest movies had a built in market provided by block booking
8116979 nuestro comandante en jefe fidel castro particip en la inauguraci n y en la clausura de aquel congreso e incluso nuestro m ximo l der se pronunci a favor de que lo declararan como un soldado m s del esperanto
8116980 so i happily accepted villarreals preview chapter last fall and now that im on sciblogs i want to give it the attention pr plug it deserves
8116981 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
8116982 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
8116983 at a time when police are feeling isolated from the communities they are recruited from and live in this ideologically driven denial of democratic rights enjoyed by every other new zealander including public servants just aggravates that feeling of isolation
8116984 the policing bill went through more than two years of community consultation and development and the government policy after that process was that police should be able to serve on councils
8116985 now it has decided at the 11th hour with no consultation to reverse that policy and undermine the rights of every new zealand police officer
8116986 any substantive reason whatsoever for the about face other than a desire to satisfy new zealand first
8116987 i think the public will look at the reality and make up its own mind
8116988 it is a different matter with community boards which act in a purely advisory way and which are quite suitable bodies for police employees to play an active part in
8116989 quite frankly i am very disappointed association president greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8116990 police believed until the very last minute that labour opposed nz firsts bid to deny them the right to serve on councils but that was before they snuck their u turn clause into the policing bill
8116991 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8116992 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8116993 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8116994 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8116995 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8116996 i havent seen a definite release date for the blackberry curve on the at amp t network and the reported issues with the 3g radio may be delaying the release there were reports that the infineon chip was a possible cause of the problem
8116997 network changes to make a faulty 3g device work in our network because its from apple
8116998 im just not convinced this is apples problem here in richmond va i get horrible 3g data performance
8116999 man no matter how many people spend unmeasurable hours trying to help me i will continue to complain and discredit them
8117000 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy
8117001 the most recent studies by wired and others bluestest in sweden seem to be all starting to point the finger at the networks and not the phone
8117002 made the iphone 3g use the network in ways and to levels that have never happened before and problems are appearing because like the tyres in my example the networks at least some of them simply cant handle it
8117003 es una maldici n hacerse viejo parece que todo te hace da o
8117004 mi familia me atiende hasta donde puede sal reci n del hospital donde estuve internado por una infecci n estomacal es una maldici n hacerse viejo porque parece que todo te hace da o
8117005 el doctor en el hospital me dijo que si sobreviv a a esta enfermedad infecci n estomacal iba a ser una bendici n del se or por que a mi edad ya es dif cil curar estas cosas
8117006 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8117007 the sport has a pace where you have to be very sensitive if this works well and it will work well i think this will help the sport help us get it right in an area that has become increasingly difficult
8117008 i dont plan on giving any home runs up on thursday so it shouldnt really bother me
8117009 as long as we can keep throwing baseballs while theyre doing the reviews that delay wont be a problem but i hope im not the first one who has to do it
8117010 i dont know if its necessary or not but i know its going to be fair to both teams you dont want home runs taken away from you
8117011 if its more than a handful of times ill be surprised its such a tough call in some other ballparks i really think they need help on those calls theres still going to be human error but with our technology theyre going to get it right
8117012 im more old school im a guy who likes the human decision of the umpire right call or wrong call
8117013 a guy might be safe and hes called out and everyone jumps up and down the fans go crazy thats kind of cool
8117014 there are a lot of bad calls you just get through it where will this end and this system isnt going to be perfect either theyre not going to catch everything
8117015 i think its really great every other sport has it why not baseball
8117016 if you have the technology why not use it everyones happier if the call is right
8117017 they can do balls and strikes that would be fine with me
8117018 i dont want to make any predictions that ill be sorry about but there are some people that believe if we handle it right it could actually be efficient in shortening the game a little bit
8117019 t he republicans are going to use from day one through day fourto hammer sen barackobama
8117020 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill d mo up there for five minutes and let her throw
8117021 there was no car crash david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all
8117022 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8117023 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8117024 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8117025 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8117026 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8117027 i will not discuss anything outside of my mourning and sympathy for the upshaw family
8117028 no word on how it went i have no idea
8117029 hes going through the appeal process no clue what went on or when its going to be finished im sure it will be done in a timely fashion
8117030 i feel like im getting close to 100 percent which is what i want to get to and the sooner i get there the better
8117031 no permitir a q nadie se interpusiera en lo q ser a su nuevo imperio el reino de kira
8117032 y en los postreros d as se levantar la bestia con poder y gloria y muchos adorar n su figura y su nombre pero su reinado durar poco x q dios bajar de nuevo a la tierra y se iniciar el juicio de la humanidad y encerrar de nuevo a la bestia y sus seguidores x la eternidad en las llamas del infierno preparado para ellos
8117033 si no me dejas hacer esto entonces no podr s ser llamado heredero del reino
8117034 when you consider that fabs in taiwan and southeast asia have basically been leading the charge in equipment spending this year theres certainly an active movement at those fabs to further automate their processes
8117035 and what were seeing is that when process engineers visually estimate transfer coordinates for robots particularly when they cant see those targets they run into more wafer scrap downtime for troubleshooting and reduced yield the practice essentially disrupts the overriding goal of automation
8117036 voting with bush 90 of the time doesnt make you a maverick it makes you a sidekick

8117041 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8117042 in a fun sort of way my relationship with george lucas is quite similar to that of a master and padawan hes a good mentor teaching me how he made star wars and i have been a student of his for the past three years
8117043 he was very excited and very involved in the project
8117044 we met about three times a week in the creative early stages and george came up with quite a few ideas
8117045 it is a very stylised aggressive new look weve tried to take it to the next level with the texture high colour contrast and the dynamic direction of battle scenes

8117047 the parliament speaker has said anwar will be sworn in as an mp on thursday
8117048 we will all be there to welcome anwar as the leader of the opposition and the parliament will be very different with his voice
8117049 it is a real morale boost for the pakatan rakyat in parliament
8117050 the problem is not to blame the problem is to understand the process
8117051 in five years we will not do everything also the next government will blame us
8117052 we saw the weaknesses of the government and that we are now going to change
8117053 with the surge in popularity for ordering clothes online we see that 90 of men dont know their exact size

8117060 if you look at what carl did it was a pretty smooth bump and run to get him out of the way and something you typically see at bristol
8117061 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8117062 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8117063 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8117064 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8117065 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8117066 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8117067 as part of technorati media well be able to grow the community and further improve our platform to attract new audiences
8117068 technoratis mission to help bloggers and people who read blogs is the ideal complement for us
8117069 amounts to suing someone for attempted distribution something the copyright act has never recognized
8117070 defendants intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach
8117071 the deliberate destruction by itself compels the conclusion that such evidence supported plaintiffs case

8117224 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8117225 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
8117226 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8117227 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8117228 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8117229 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8117230 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8117231 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8117232 oh ive got to get my picture with biff henderson of letterman hold on a second
8117233 i havent yet run into anybody who doesnt want one in fact i usually run into people who want more than one
8117234 weve got a lot to be proud of in the democratic party
8117235 i saw everybody walking out of the hall with those michelle signs
8117236 but i can never get home with any ive left a lot behind for the hotel maids
8117237 a lot of a convention is about the image that is projected to the country
8117238 these are probably gonna be thrown in the trash now
8117239 but i hope to get a few of them to show my boys that their dad amounted to something at some point
8117240 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8117241 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8117242 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8117243 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8117244 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8117245 and that is especially important for us to believe on this day because were meeting on a historic day
8117246 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got into arguments from time to time who contributed so generously to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8117247 so lets devote all the passion and the energy we have and theres a lot of it
8117248 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8117249 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8117250 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8117251 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8117252 hillary got a raw deal right we dont want obama right it seems like were on the same team
8117253 go and put them back how they are suppose to be
8117254 we all know that he wants to be loved just call him call him any time of day or night
8117255 talk to him about anything talk to him about the olympics or what he thinks about a certain congressional district or even about the new york times sunday crossword puzzle obama could even put the phone in a drawer and just let president clinton talk away it wouldnt take much it could be so easy
8117256 i could see that clinton might have endorsed him obama has a lot of attributes he values
8117257 one difference between the two guys is that obama never had an uncle buddy who lived in a trailer
8117258 with his memorable cast and nicely underplayed big themes zebrun delivers a new and worthy perspective on the 9 11 experience
8117259 here we have a large wooden executive desk with matching credenza
8117260 it was a nice crowd but the sale of office furniture and equipment is down
8117261 there are a lot of empty offices around the city
8117262 nope two hundred cmon people this is probably a 1 000 set up
8117263 have a co worker give you one of my checks made out for 50 and take that if you cannot go i will just send it with a note
8117264 his physicians had been wary of the trip especially his exposure to crowds given the weakness of his immune system
8117265 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8117266 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8117267 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8117268 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8117269 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8117270 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8117271 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8117272 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8117273 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8117274 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8117275 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8117276 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8117277 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8117278 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8117279 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8117280 ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter and culture which we put on like an overcoat is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable
8117281 these people are more interested in showing how divided the democratic party might be divided if hillarys people become complete assholes and forget their democratic roots and vote for john mccain than the cohesion the party is showing on the stage right now
8117282 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe

8117289 you are crossing your right leg over your left with your left arm crossed over your right and your head is tilted slightly to your right
8117290 you are frowning your arms are crossed and you are breathing heavily
8117291 could this behavior mean something else to someone else in the room
8117292 you are crossing your right leg over your left with your left arm crossed over your right and your head is tilted slightly to your right
8117293 you are frowning your arms are crossed and you are breathing heavily
8117294 could this behavior mean something else to someone else in the room
8117295 if i had the money we would not be talking right now
8117296 it clearly needed some work we painted as much as we could afford but its a much bigger project than what had been done
8117297 the idea was to not have it drag out to ask people to help a cause they feel very close to
8117298 no catholic no evangelical can ethically vote obama and biden because they support legalized child killing by abortion
8117299 every christian voter needs to see obama and biden for what they are the most strident supporters of child killing ever seen in a presidential race
8117300 abortion is murder and no faithful christian catholic or protestant can vote for obama its that simple
8117301 if we take a more free market approach i think
8117302 if we need energy we will find a way to get it
8117303 if you look at democratic sen barack obama and how he raises money for his campaign it was just so viral one person tells another using facebook
8117304 everyone has an answer about who theyre going to vote for
8117305 i think ultimately im just not sure how different either of them will be
8117306 theyre both reaching out toward the middle right now so whats the difference
8117307 what i mostly see is a lot of compromising on both sides and a lot of bringing people under the umbrella so theres no strong center
8117308 i just feel like everyone speaks in this lingo of either the other sides failure or our success and thats how political campaigns are won but its refreshing when you think that someones talking about an issue because they believe in it
8117309 theres a difference in experience theres a difference in the approach to decision making i think obama does seem more inspirational to me but mccain has a lot of experience in doing the kind of mind bending or boundary crossing things obama talks about
8117310 i wouldnt even call myself a democrat im definitely an independent or a moderate but ive seen a lot of people who arent interested in politics get very interested again in the political system and the democratic system here in the united states which i think is something very good for the country and good for the future
8117311 id really like to see obama and vice presidential candidate sen joseph biden be able to tie in whats going on now with what obamas message was in the past cause i think getting out of the primary season into the election season its getting dangerous now to fall into what obama would call the old style of politics and obamas definitely in danger of falling into that himself if hes not careful any politician would be
8117312 every step of the way since that clear day 19 months ago
8117313 i think she resonated with me and in that sense what she was saying was a broad vision of america and ive got to take it into consideration
8117314 they are incredible examples and inspirational whether they are in the white house or not i think this has been a really great thing for america to have them running
8117315 her emphasis on family values and the love of family and of america as a family and moving forward im no expert in politics but its not something thats traditionally associated with the democratic party
8117316 i find it especially interesting as a young evangelical christian how the democratic party is in ways saying a lot of the things that my generation of christians are saying about values and community and working together what michelle obama is saying is mirroring a lot of what i am hearing in other places its interesting a convergence of two different worlds
8117317 in 1996 bob dole citing the clinton campaigns scabrous fundrainsing exclaimed

8117320 all the senior women in my district so many of them have said to me that theyre afraid theyll never see a woman in the white house
8117321 shes a true american heroine and i think she just won the presidential race for obama
8117322 it was the way she said it her inflection and her poise this came from her heart and i think a lot of us were listening

8117340 we have been monitoring traffic for a long time and trends dont just happen for no reason in the past six months congestion has eased quite significantly the credit crunch is clearly the reason for that
8117341 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at slower and more economical speeds
8117342 part of the reason for these decreases is simply that there are fewer cars on the road as the price of fuel is making it too expensive for people to drive
8117343 peoples budgets are being squeezed and what is happening is that they are changing their driving habits while they are not necessarily getting rid of their cars they arent driving as often or they are perhaps car sharing to save money
8117344 the figures show that congestion has steadily continued to ease over the past six months it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next year or so because the credit crunch looks like its going to continue
8117345 it is true that people appear to be aware of what is known as eco driving they realise that if they drive slower they will be able to make a tank of fuel go that bit further its quite sensible when you consider most people will be paying upwards of 60 for a tank of fuel

8117357 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8117358 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8117359 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8117360 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8117361 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8117362 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8117363 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8117364 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears
8117365 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8117366 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8117367 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8117368 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me

8117373 who am i that i should go to pharoah and bring the israelites out of egypt
8117374 the call of jesus teaches us that our relation to the world has been built on an illusion all the time we thought we had enjoyed a direct relation with men and things this is what had hindered us from faith and obedience now we learn that in the most intimate relationships of life in our kinship with father and mother brothres and sisters in married love and in our duty to the community direct relationships are impossible we cannot establish direct contact outside ourselves except through him jesus through his word and through our following of him to think otherwise is to deceive ourselves

8117380 i think that speaks to the amount of respect he has for our friendship weve been together now for over 20 years
8117381 i suspect theres a tremendous chance hell be on the property next year but the most important thing is that he gets his knee back where he wants to

8117383 meanwhile we continue to provide our customers with products and services to address their needs and ensure that consumers get the full benefits of sirfs innovations
8117384 like all americans westerners grumble at the rising cost of gasoline and home heating but we also host the nations greatest storehouse of natural resources and worry about how the rush to drill for gas and oil mine uranium and eventually perhaps produce oil shale can affect our fragile environment and precious water resources and we cant wait for both parties to address those issues
8117385 we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8117409 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8117410 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8117411 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8117412 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8117413 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8117414 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8117415 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8117416 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8117417 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8117418 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8117419 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8117420 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home

8117433 la cat strofe provocada por el accidente del avi n md macdonald douglas de spanair el pasado 20 de agosto en el aeropuerto de madrid barajas con un balance de 154 muertos y 19 heridos es solo la punta del iceberg de una situaci n que se agrava d a a d a que se hace insostenible y que tanto las empresas a reas como aena como el gobierno espa ol como los gobiernos auton micos y como la uni n europea son colectiva y directamente responsables debido al modelo neoliberal de transporte a reo desarrollado en estos 15 ltimos a os

8117435 the seventeenth century philosopher john locke noted that we christians say we believe the most marvelous earth shattering and revolutionary things that we are fully loved by a good and all powerful god who will never fail to secure us in life and death that we are therefore free to experience and exhibit selfless love and courage and joy every day no matter what for eternity but how many of us live as if these things are true john locke estimated not one in ten thousand dallas willard has written so clearly regarding the nature of faith namely we believe something not when we say we do or even when we believe we do but when we act as if we do
8117436 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
8117437 for he who lacks these things is shortsighted even to blindness and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his sins
8117438 we have as our ambition our goal in life that which we live for that which we want to accomplish more than anything else to be pleasing to him
8117439 if i acted crazy i did it for god christs love has moved me to such extremes his love has the first and last word in everything we do
8117440 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because it is right
8117441 damaged damaged damaged damaged i thought that i should let you know that my heart is damaged damaged so damaged so damaged and you can blame the one before so how you gonna fix it fix it fix it

8117488 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president i was sixty two years old when i made the decision and i thought it was my one shot at the prize

8117492 he has led more than 50 murder trials and some of the states biggest and most complex fraud trials
8117493 judge brebner has already made a lasting contribution to the law in south australia
8117494 im sure he will build on this in his new role as a judge of the district court

8117496 mum was just a great person and she didnt deserve to die the way she died
8117497 she was the most precious mother sister and friend that ever lived on this earth she would have done anything for anyone
8117498 my immediate call is for the meeting of waterport victor harbor to adelaide and welch roads be put into an 80 km hr zone as a matter of urgency and planning take place on the possibility of a rural roundabout
8117499 the continuing impact on families through ongoing accidents must be addressed
8117500 as development of our community extends further along the adelaide road the merits of a lower speed limit will become more evident
8117501 a reduction in the speed limit seems inevitable and we are trying to lock in an early timeframe for this to occur
8117502 the speed limit must be reduced all along that area
8117503 something has got to be done it was the second fatal accident in 12 months and minor accidents happen all the time
8117504 in the end we need a roundabout but how many lives do we have to lose before that happens weve lost too many already
8117505 have applied to hold protests even though they know that they are more likely to end up in jail than in a protest zone
8117506 the olympics are for the government we ordinary chinese still have to earn a living
8117507 of course the residents of the former british colony did not experience communist rule there and are as a consequence less cynical than their mainland compatriots
8117508 there was so much buildup to athens and so many concerns about security and facilities that when we got to torino we felt like we were playing catch up and trying to get the public interested in the games
8117509 what will the air be like after olympics is over and we are gone
8117510 why does mommy eat ice cream out of the container and cry

8117518 in the court of international public opinion china will be seen to have gotten away with cheating in these olympics

8117520 on july 31st 2001 lopez lomong was able to run from africa and landed in the upstate new york community of tully and into a new life
8117521 two new americans received the i o c waiver of the three year waiting period after getting citizenship this year the equestrian phillip p dutton who won two gold medals for australia and the canoeist heather corrie who is also a british citizen
8117522 in my opinion china needs to consider recognizing dual citizenship
8117523 a competitor who has represented one country in the olympic games in continental or regional games or in world or regional championships recognised by the relevant if and who has changed his nationality or acquired a new nationality may participate in the olympic games to represent his new country provided that at least three years have passed since the competitor last represented his former country this period may be reduced or even cancelled with the agreement of the nocs and if concerned by the ioc executive board which takes into account the circumstances of each case
8117524 as i said your post is symptomatic of chinas larger problem which is of credibility
8117525 does the west have a better reputation and more credibility than china in being truthful
8117526 where does this impression come from on what reality is it based
8117527 if we check the record on which country rank highest in sending doping athletes to represent them in the olympics i am sure to find western countries way ahead of china who has a credibility problem
8117528 the human mind can really be a freak of nature
8117529 one thing i have learned from my experiences is that those who are really crazy always insist that they are sane
8117530 did the united states bend its laws and standard procedures to make it more expedient for lomong to become a citizen than for the average jose from mexico
8117531 there is less and less potential for self examination and innovation
8117532 by the way every single one of the athletes on team china has been born to chinese parents and raised in the territory of the peoples republic of china under the red flag wearing the red young pioneers scarf nourished with chinese food water and culture take that hypocrites of the world
8117533 the west simply doesnt share our preoccupation with race as such granting citizenship to established athletes from other countries is no problem for them while most chinese would react in horror to find a white person from the u s or western europe playing for china
8117534 how do you win in this court you win by manipulation duplicity and above all by just being a jerk
8117535 the mistake of chinawatcher and others is that they view the chinese as a passive and helpless recipient of western public opinions
8117536 intenational public opinion is a bitch you do what you have to do with a bitch take her out buy her shit but never let a bitch ruin your day chinese wants foriegn correspondents expats to know what we think to like china everybody wants to be understood but theres only so much you can do the last thing you want to do is to start a piss off contest with a bitch
8117537 dude how did this become about tibet is everything about tibet as ive said elsewhere the girls age isnt the focus for me its about the flawed process and the flaws in chinese governmental accountability at whichever level of government you feel the flaws occurred
8117538 and women use this word far often than men besides some women are proud to be bitches now they think the word has a mixed touch of fashionism and feminism they have a top liner magazine titled bitch you are too out but if you say its the rule of the place i will certainly repsect it
8117539 the key thing in achieving understanding is to look at the pattern the trend the big picture the gestalt with a historical and global perspective coming up with sharp theoretical models for representing the patterns is the crucial step incidents looked in isolation are never illuminating
8117540 you win by manipulation duplicity and above all by just being a jerk learn from the americans and europeans and dont be an idiot

8117553 there were some airports that were affected more than others
8117554 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8117555 so what we had to do was dump all of the flight plan information that was in the system and then manually enter the people who were waiting to take off
8117556 thats what created the ripple effect throughout the system and created the delays that we had
8117557 there is no indication of a terrorism nexus at this time
8117558 the pads last whistle blow is unjustified unnecessary provocative and illegal
8117559 if the pad really wants to bring down the government it should do so through the parliament that is the proper democratic place to do it
8117560 ideological grouping whose motives have gone from clear cut to incomprehensible
8117561 with most if not all key contentious political issues now in the hands of the courts the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8117562 even though the station may be seen as partial but they should not have expressed their dislike in such a violent manner
8117563 the interior minister has instructed us to restore law and order as soon as possible

8117566 if the pad really wants to bring down the government it should do so through the parliament that is the proper democratic place to do it
8117567 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in the health insurance from public health insurance
8117568 the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8117569 to take one ounce of comfort from these statistics would be deluding yourself
8117570 todays announcement reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8117571 another 816 000 americans fell into poverty in 2007 including nearly 500 000 children bringing the total increase in americans in poverty under president bush to 5 7 million and on bushs watch an additional 7 2 million americans have fallen into the ranks of the uninsured

8117578 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8117579 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
8117580 since the united states is a permanent member of the u n security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
8117581 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border on the korean peninsula
8117582 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world

8117836 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse

8117851 sure nearstore is not raid dp and sure thats really bad but it is not as bad as it could be because vtl raid isnt quite as bad as normal single parity raid
8117852 there is almost no situation in which if you have a sufficiently large amount of data archiving doesnt make financial sense even if you deduplicate all your backups it is still usually better to archive it that way you dont have to back it up at all
8117853 if there are other platforms that do i will happily add them to my list
8117854 the advantages of dual parity are in robust data protection specifically raid 6 can sustain two simultaneous drive failures in any raid group without loss of data
8117855 raid 5 is dangerous anyone running raid 5 on large 1tb drives and theyre getting larger is running a serious and measurable risk the likelihood of one drive failing for some reason and say a single bit media error on another during raid reconstruct has increased to levels that make single parity systems much more likely to suffer catastrophic data loss in everyday operation
8117856 especailly worrying is that these kind of drives are being used for archive backup and recovery and dr purposes
8117857 content mirroring on ahem centera cas for improved disk failure protection and rebuild times compared to raid3 amp raid5
8117858 raid dp from netapp is a proprietary implementation of raid double parity for data protection
8117859 even with good raid protection it is still important to evaluate threats to data loss and implement proper backup and replication technologies to ensure that your most important data is protected in all situations
8117860 the added reliability of raid 6 may come at the cost of performance when compared with other raid types raid 6 has a disadvantage to raid 5 and raid 1 0 for small random writes and system write bandwidth performance which are most applications but other i o profiles are not affected as significantly
8117861 this is exactly why raid dp gets deployed by default and is the de facto standard on all netapp implementations it dramatically increases the data availability by surviving the
8117862 it was his living room collection in spring 2000 that sealed his reputation a range of tables and chairs transformed into clothing slipcovers became dresses chairs were folded into an attach case and a round table became a skirt the models serenely picked up the furniture put it on and walked off

8117865 i can also confirm that tape smart sizing works exactly as advertised
8117866 tape smart sizing sample s the data for compressibility as its being written to the vtl and then dynamically adjust the size of that virtual tape to match the estimated compressed capacity of the physical tape it will be written to the lto 3 virtual tape is now automatically adjusted depending on what type of data is being written to it and how it will compress in the real tape world welcome to not wasting money or space on extra physical tapes when using a vtl
8117867 i hope we are able to pass these reform bills in this congress
8117868 you forgot to mention that i warned the people about the british coming
8117869 what should we be looking for in our next president certainly someone who is very very very old
8117870 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8117871 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8117872 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8117873 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8117874 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8117875 we only have a very few players who are not able to effectively communicate in english
8117876 would be subject to the new york state human rights law with respect to any tournaments taking place in new york and it is possible that the public accommodations provisions of that law could apply to this situation
8117877 but we have reached out to others who are not korean and other international players and impressed upon them the need to speak english and the requirements of this policy players have been very supportive of it
8117878 from what i can see golfers from other countries will not be required to speak only english while engaged in lpga activities rather they will be required to pass an english proficiency test if the lpga can show that english proficiency is a relevant qualification to competing in a professional golf tournament in the u s they would have a defense to any claim that they are discriminating unlawfully
8117879 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8117880 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8117881 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8117882 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish

8117887 the only thing that mccain will recycle is the same failed george bush energy policy
8117888 with the right leadership theres no nation we cant out hustle or outcompete
8117889 the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas and when hope replaces fear
8117890 most people will see little if any disruption the closures will be past the main arrivals pick up area
8117891 people will have time to move their cars our goal is to have a lot of signage explaining what is going on
8117892 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8117893 you know starting the week off by introducing barack obama to the nation is not a bad goal
8117894 aside from teddy kennedy and michelle obama not much happened on the first day
8117895 en mi opini n eso la propuesta de alan garc a est muy bien pero que se garantice los que significa el derecho de los pueblos ind genas a que esta iniciativa tambi n provenga de los mismas comunidades
8117896 los pueblos ind genas ya no van hacer movilizaciones que perjudican a los propios peruanos nosotros ya nos hemos hecho escuchar estamos en la agenda y realmente queremos ir al di logo como ciudadanos peruanos
8117897 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8117898 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8117899 i still cannot see an easy end to the turbulence
8117900 it might take days or months until everything reaches the point where violence erupts
8117901 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
8117902 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8117903 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8117904 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8117905 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church of northern colorado
8117906 santa barbara is a symbol for the country and the world on the dangers that can occur with offshore oil drilling
8117907 the problem is were addicted to oil and this addiction is slowly poisoning us all more pollution more global warming and more economic instability
8117908 more oil is not the answer it is the problem
8117909 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8117910 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8117911 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8117912 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8117913 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8117914 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8117915 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8117916 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8117917 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8117918 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8117919 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8117920 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8117921 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8117922 my mother was born before women had the right to vote my daughter was able to vote for her mother for president
8117923 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8117924 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8117925 it is time now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8117926 freezing in the dark money power politics and the vast left wing conspiracy
8117927 a philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery
8117928 hard work duty and obligation self reliance high levels of national pride pro life values rejection of homosexuality belief in the importance of religion and god in ones life and that children should learn respect and obedience
8117929 they are both going to do what they have to do
8117930 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
8117931 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8117932 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
8117933 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
8117934 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
8117935 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people politicos guide to the conventions
8117936 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
8117937 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
8117938 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
8117939 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
8117940 hillary is very goal oriented and so the goal shifted from ive got to win to baracks got to win
8117941 with bill clinton the transition was harder because he wasnt the candidate its difficult when the candidate and the target of obamas primary campaign is his wife
8117942 so look i can unequivocally say i will not be running for national office in four years
8117943 caring for the least among us each and every day
8117944 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing
8117945 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand
8117946 for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do

8117977 when will mayor daley step up and show us what theyve done with that money and whether or not the schools have gotten better with all of that funding
8117978 we are here because we want to work with the leaders of both parties regardless of the outcome of the election on a number of very very critical issues in this country
8117979 our basic objective is we want to keep enough people in the senate that we can sustain a filibuster
8117980 more democrats remind me that thats a good idea than republicans because they know that if they belong just to the labor unions and the trial lawyers they may have a resounding number of victories but they wont be here very long to enjoy them

8118021 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8118022 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8118023 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8118024 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8118025 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video

8118048 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships

8118054 my life depended on football so much that when it was gone even the chance of not being able to have it paralyzed me with fear schweiger said
8118055 so i started to do crazy stuff the drinking and drugs and girls were an escape because i just wanted to be free from the pain when id do that stuff id be free for a minute but when i was done the pain came back twofold every time
8118056 i found that i was playing football for acceptance and fame and was motivated by fear

8118065 i was really looking forward not to lose to the same player twice in a row and especially this close to the defeat so im happy about that
8118066 it is pretty open no one is really dominating the game like it used to be before
8118067 i think it could give me an opportunity to come back to a great level
8118068 since i arrived on campus andy has been a great leader for this program on the field in the locker room in the classroom and done everything we ask of all student athletes
8118069 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes
8118070 when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
8118071 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8118072 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8118073 things like this you hope to learn from and get better
8118074 even though weve got manny were not gonna beat peoples brains out
8118075 were not gonna go out there and outscore people in high scoring games very much
8118076 he earned it he didnt get it by default i love the way that it went down as opposed to him just being out here and not having competition
8118077 i couldnt move right to left i couldnt go to my left you cant tell the coach nah lets just run right it doesnt work too good
8118078 i knew after getting hurt i couldnt come in and mess around this was kind of make or break that probably added a little extra motivation for me getting that thing fixed has been the biggest thing
8118079 before jake got hurt he was playing well but he wasnt the same jake that we see right now

8118098 while things look better in 2007 than they did in 2006 i think theres a lot of cause for con that in 2008 as we see the effects of higher unemployment and greater fiscal pressures on states those numbers will start going back up again
8118099 our public programs are valiantly trying to pick up the slack from the erosion of private coverage by employers and individuals but now this budget crisis threatens to make severe cuts in the public programs that are the last hope for so many californians
8118100 with the worsening economy its harder for families to pick up that coverage if theyre bearing a higher share of that cost a small change coupled with higher gas and higher food prices makes it more difficult
8118101 the real story is how easy we have made it in america to get someone else to pay their bills after they get sick
8118102 when your dealing with outside branches or los and a big company has a larger target on their back than most a company can do a great job with compliance and still get into a mess of one kind or another

8118116 its a reminder of the time when campus didnt extend much beyond the quad
8118117 its like i tell our players youre only as good as your last game
8118118 in our last game we werent very good so we still have a ways to go thats the one thing we stressed from our very first meeting we made some progress and i want them to be proud of that i want them to feel good about that but on the same token we still have a ways to go
8118119 the positives if there are positives are obviously that you know exactly where you are
8118120 when you play a team the caliber of missouri its going to give you an opportunity to know exactly where your program is and the things you have to work on
8118121 i think our practice has probably been a little bit more spirited
8118122 when you go to camp you dont worry about one game you prepare for the season but you always have that game in the back of your mind its a great challenge and a great opportunity our guys i think are really enjoying the fact of being able to compete against a top team like missouri
8118123 theyve got almost everybody back from a defense that was really pretty good
8118124 they were able to stymie people last year and they got better and better as the year went along which really added to the success of their team
8118125 were not unlike where we were a year ago today
8118126 we werent sure where we were going to be we had a chance to be a pretty good running team we felt like the opportunity was there we knew rashard had a bunch of god given ability but he hadnt done it yet
8118127 we have a pretty good feel for what daniel can do we have a pretty good feel for what mikel leshoure can do and troy pollard jason ford was the last guy that we hadnt seen before camp i dont see at this point one guy taking it over but if they do thats great
8118128 we told them in the very first meeting in january that everything we do is to try to win games
8118129 whether it be the workouts whether it be camp whether it be lifting the meetings that we have whatever it is its just to try to win games that opportunity starts saturday night

8118137 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8118138 my advice is that these cracks do not present a risk under normal use but that crowds during riverfire on the walkway would pose problems
8118139 this has been a difficult decision but the safety of the public is paramount and thats why we are closing the section of the walkway now
8118140 reparations bring me off but im still gon talk which is available for download now
8118141 few acts combine rap music pro gay sloganeering and spiritual enlightenment quite like yo majesty
8118142 if punk was originally about defying labels celebrating misfits creating new sounds and doing it all on ones own terms hand wringers about that genre should open their ears and listen no further because by those criteria yo majesty is the most punk fucking rock thing out there right now
8118143 yo majesty absolutely blew my mind shunda k amp jwl b came out and tore into a set that was explosive aggressive and relentless
8118144 ive always been interested in the idea of performance art
8118145 i got into looking at what peoples experience of art could be
8118146 santa barbara has a rich performing arts tradition but not a lot of it is really cutting edge or avant garde
8118147 at caf for the past 31 years thats what weve done thats our niche as a new director i saw that there were all these amazing performing arts events that had happened here in the 1970s and 80s but they hadnt been happening in recent history
8118148 it was a very important time in contemporary art it was very interdisciplinary a lot of early performances reflected the kind of art being shown in alternative spaces in new york and los angeles we wanted to bring about a dialogue about contemporary art that was not occurring in santa barbara at that time
8118149 the nea national endowment for the arts was supporting alternative arts programming so grants could be written and obtained quite readily to bring performance artists to caf
8118150 that was one big reason we had good viable program we had good grant writers and a lot of people who traveled enough to see interesting performance art that could be brought back here
8118151 id get a few weeks away and id go oh no i havent planned anything for forum lounge this month
8118152 i feel like performance art is going through a renaissance
8118153 the fact that caf is bringing this work to santa barbara again is exciting its so important and the programming for this year is so strong
8118154 these days people think santa barbara is for billionaires and tourists
8118155 theres always room for improvement ive never made the perfect bowl
8118156 i thought printmaking was a waste of effort at first because i didnt know how to do it
8118157 as i began to do more and more i developed my own technique i liked the surprises youd get from a print
8118158 little shifts happen when you being to push and suddenly amazing things happen
8118159 if im in the middle of working and im in a hurry ill just stash it somewhere
8118160 if you keep these kids on the field you keep them off the streets
8118161 id rather have jericho in the midst of this controversy on the field than dealing drugs on a street corner
8118162 when something good happens to me i like to wait two weeks before i tell anyone

8118185 leah and my mother were girlhood friends in new orleans

8118225 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
8118226 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
8118227 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
8118228 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
8118229 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
8118230 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
8118231 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
8118232 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
8118233 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
8118234 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
8118235 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
8118236 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
8118237 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
8118238 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
8118239 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
8118240 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
8118241 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
8118242 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
8118243 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
8118244 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
8118245 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
8118246 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
8118247 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
8118248 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
8118249 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
8118250 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
8118251 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
8118252 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
8118253 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
8118254 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
8118255 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
8118256 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
8118257 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
8118258 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

8118308 hell be given every chance to make the team when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8118309 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress
8118310 were not going to be able to start finding that out until we drop the puck for real
8118311 the key word for the maple leafs management and coaching is going to be patience you cant force things to happen you have to let them unfold and happen at their own pace
8118312 we will be patient we will give a lot of young players that opportunity to become better players and to become a good hockey team
8118313 i think most hockey fans in this area understand what our situation is here i think they have a pretty good feeling for what has to be done to build a much better team
8118314 the feeling i get from many leafs fans is that they
8118315 the maple leafs are perennially and justifiably measured against the franchises last stanley cup winner in 1967 and there are precious can mark bell regain his form

8118318 did you vote just for me or for the woman with cancer
8118319 were you in it for me or for the cause
8118320 i think that obama is the best choice because he
8118321 were you in this for me or in it for

8118323 the only reason many of her supporters were voting for clinton was because she was a woman

8118334 any gi who say he didnt get laid last night is just bragging
8118335 1 offense preceedeing an attack by the american army there is always artillery bombardment for at least 12 hours when this is begun at dawn or on the previous night there are frequently an attack and an advance in the afternoon attack formation they are quite brave and use mainly automatic rifles on rare occasions they send out ahead patrols of 2 or 3 men outline of infantry attack when they come 300 or 400 meters in front of the fortified positions first of all they always stop construct fortified positions in the last phase of combat they use flamethrowers and molotov cocktails so long as even one of our men remains in a position and resists they do not break through they penetrate little by little most cautiously but very steadily they advance while successively destroying every fortified position attack according to schedule american troops conduct their attacks according to a planned table consequently as a general rule there is no such thing as taking advantage of an opportunity once they have executed an order which they were given at the outset they seem to stop defense enemy close range defensive battle depends on machine guns and battalion howitzers as soon as they perceive that we are approaching they repeatedly carry out a concentrated searching fire of 20 guns in the already prepared zone of fire if one breaks this zone or rushes through the pockets it becomes unexpectedly easy but breaking through the zone of fire by force whether by day or night requires a considerable degree of neutralization and tremendous spirit one should not employ mass formations the enemy is not clever in a certain sense for when his positions are penetrated by one of our units he becomes panic stricken we should take full advantage of this and should lose no opportunity to penetrate his positions and drive him out of them stress laid upon areas in the rear in the american army the stress laid upon rear areas is quite considerable and the japanese forces including the navy cannot compare with them not only do they from strong points in their rear but they make persistent and utmost efforts to cut off our rear this is to say the enemy is constantly attacking our transport ships rather than our warships in guadalcanal they caried this out to an excessive degree with untiring efforts consequently if we can cut off the enmys rear areas to half the extent that they do ours their suffering will be beyond imagination
8118336 honestly you cannot tell the difference in a fake check and a real check its not like a counterfeit 100 bill you cant take a marker and mark that

8118338 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8118339 its not the way i drew it up when i came to the park today
8118340 it was the biggest pitch in the game he was in a position where one pitch could turn the whole game around if alex gets a hit there they have their lefty hitters coming up and they get the ball rolling
8118341 i can make 2 outs better than anybody at one time

8118358 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8118359 and when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time democrats know how to do this as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again

8118369 its been a struggle up until now to get hillary supporters to support obama and frankly its going to continue to be a struggle until november
8118370 she obviously wants to help her supporters understand that obama will be as supportive but more importantly he has to convince the supporters that he will dedicate time energy and funds to make sure women have their rights

8118475 we are the parents of students in this school system
8118476 releasing a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers in it
8118477 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
8118478 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
8118479 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
8118480 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
8118481 we petted them and played with them and held them
8118482 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
8118483 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
8118484 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
8118485 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
8118486 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
8118487 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
8118488 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
8118489 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
8118490 theyre the ones that do the exchange rate they should have known or checked it at that moment
8118491 teach the girl how its a great experience and normal
8118492 i tried to pull it together tried to get answers at least a lead where i could find my daughter
8118493 were going to make sure we separate those students who are supposed to stay in after school programs and those who are bus riders
8118494 personal marriage issues should be decided by you your family and clergy not by the government
8118495 this ad is just factually wrong and red and blue needs to be held accountable for false and misleading advertisements
8118496 to the contrary the citizen initiated and citizen led amendment 2 has nothing at all to do with government action it has everything to do with citizen action stopping the government from redefining marriage against their will amendment 2 allows the people and not activist judges to decide how marriage will be defined in florida this is only the first of a series of ads in an avalanche of fraud and deception that is going to flood the airways in the october
8118497 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8118498 this hardly seems like unity among democrats on the issue of the definition of marriage
8118499 marriage is not a democratic or a republican issue its not even a liberal conservative issue it is a human issue and a moral issue and one which floridians will vote yes on in overwhelming numbers on november 4 2008
8118500 telling senior citizens that they will lose social security and or domestic partner benefits by voting yes on 2 is outright fraud and preys upon floridas most vulnerable and precious citizens
8118501 the marriage covenant by which a man and a woman form with each other an intimate communion of life and love has been founded and endowed with its own special laws by the creator by its very nature it is ordered to the good of the couple as well as to the generation and education of children christ the lord raised marriage between the baptized to the dignity of a sacrament
8118502 congressman joe courtney has done more for eastern connecticut in two years than his predecessor in six including securing 900 million for tuition assistance programs to make college more affordable for families and students introducing bipartisan legislation to make health care more affordable for small businesses and their employees and saving thousands of jobs at electric boat
8118503 the fact of the matter is that joe courtneys record is abysmal and has done nothing to address the high costs of energy while courtney is enjoying his fun in the sun vacation in which he voted for eastern connecticut families are hurting in the pocketbook there is only one candidate in this race that is committed to reducing our dependence on foreign oil for drilling on federal lands and for more nuclear power that candidate is sean sullivan
8118504 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8118505 as we understand it and were waiting for final confirmation of this two light planes possibly landing or taking off from moorabbin have clipped wings ms braddy said
8118506 one of those planes landed successfully and the other has crash landed into a houses garden area
8118507 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8118508 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8118509 theres a lot of animus there because it was so close
8118510 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of ber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8118511 but those things only happen if shes seen as doing the right thing now
8118512 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8118513 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8118514 my biggest disappointment was when i found out a few weeks ago that i would be missing the olympics and u s open
8118515 a lot more goes into a tournament than just playing
8118516 we have already met all possible kinds of guys and whatever happens we know how to make it your fault
8118517 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8118518 cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8118519 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8118520 one of the reasons weve implemented the plain black background is to emphasize this new persistent desktop notification
8118521 for new notifications installations in windows xp pro customers will also have a simple eula to accept rather than an installation wizard
8118522 this eula has been modified to allow the anti piracy validation control to auto update itself for future releases
8118523 the updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of this supplement and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you
8118524 users will have the same ability to view and prevent future updates to wga over au as they do for any update distributed over au today
8118525 that is they could use the download updates for me but let me choose when to install them or notify me but dont automatically download or install them
8118526 they want the ability to stay up to date with the least effort required on their part
8118527 following an ancient health ritual one which keeps all their senses alive
8118528 next year we must create our own snowshoes specially meant for the snowshoe football so we can play without unnecessary breaks and without broken gear
8118529 technology has really been a dead zone in the white house
8118530 but an absence of those who woke up every day and thought about issues and were available for people who had ideas and concerns
8118531 theres a lot to do to course correct from where we are
8118532 a dramatic way to signal that the next administration would be one that takes tech seriously
8118533 this has been an administration that has treated science as anything other than science
8118534 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8118535 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8118536 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8118537 if we start to turn around what government is supposed to do to serve the people we start with a mindset about what it is we have to get done
8118538 very good people who are thinking theyre doing their best
8118539 budgets have to change people have to change and expertise has to be added to the process
8118540 this isnt something that cant be done its something that isnt thought about
8118541 if democrats are telling us hes not ready to be president of the united states we better listen
8118542 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8118543 im here to make a few points for the good side
8118544 theres no reason to pay the extra 600 to 800 or a 40 to 80 premium for a solid state drive
8118545 i think you need to get to 128gb for around 200 and thats going to happen around 2010 also the industry needs to effectively communicate why consumers or enterprise users should pay more for less storage
8118546 as a percentage of the whole solid state drive industry itll remain pretty light for now
8118547 she was suffering from a stomach upset all weekend which meant she couldnt go out anywhere and then this happened she is fine now though
8118548 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8118549 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8118550 folks always ask me whats my biggest criticism of president bush im sure you all have your own heres mine its not just the policy differences its the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources the character and resolve of the american people he never really asked us to step up
8118551 a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids no real strategy to invest in our infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats just not right thats four more years that we just cant afford
8118552 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter whether its got a d or an r next to it because this election isnt about liberal vs conservative its not about left vs right its about the future vs the past
8118553 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8118554 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8118555 what would i do if i had billions of dollars
8118556 the sport has a pace where you have to be very sensitive if this works well and it will work well i think this will help the sport help us get it right in an area that has become increasingly difficult
8118557 i dont plan on giving any home runs up on thursday so it shouldnt really bother me
8118558 as long as we can keep throwing baseballs while theyre doing the reviews that delay wont be a problem but i hope im not the first one who has to do it
8118559 i dont know if its necessary or not but i know its going to be fair to both teams you dont want home runs taken away from you
8118560 if its more than a handful of times ill be surprised its such a tough call in some other ballparks i really think they need help on those calls theres still going to be human error but with our technology theyre going to get it right
8118561 im more old school im a guy who likes the human decision of the umpire right call or wrong call
8118562 a guy might be safe and hes called out and everyone jumps up and down the fans go crazy thats kind of cool
8118563 there are a lot of bad calls you just get through it where will this end and this system isnt going to be perfect either theyre not going to catch everything
8118564 i think its really great every other sport has it why not baseball
8118565 if you have the technology why not use it everyones happier if the call is right
8118566 they can do balls and strikes that would be fine with me
8118567 i dont want to make any predictions that ill be sorry about but there are some people that believe if we handle it right it could actually be efficient in shortening the game a little bit
8118568 being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe
8118569 human is my most personal album to date i have grown so much since my last album being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe
8118570 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8118571 delivered great papers and has done a magnificent job in reinvigorating the age
8118572 the company is discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8118573 the editorial leadership team have my highest confidence i know they will excel in leading the editorial staff of the age to ensure the ages continuing success
8118574 all i can do is be me whoever that is
8118575 i had a very pleasant experience with wu yi they were more than happy to answer all my questions when i did have them and i was able to lose the 15 pounds i wanted 2 thumbs up
8118576 i bought this tea 1 week ago and im already seeing results well lets see what happens by the end of the month if my credit card gets charged for stuff i did not buy like i now hear people say i can guarantee all hell will break loose i excersize and i diet well so i am not relying on the tea 100 but i am using it to kind of pick up the pace of the weight loss well like i said its only been 1 week lets see what happens
8118577 with the wu yi tea they give you a free trial and also include the living lean program free trial the living lean program is proven to work if you commit yourself to it the living lean has a 21 day trial in which is more than enough time to complete the program living lean is however a wonderful program to get involved with it is not the traditional program for weight loss but has a success rate of 90 if you commit to the program
8118578 so far things are going well i have lost more than 10 lbs after 3 weeks drinking the tea
8118579 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8118580 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8118581 what would you give me to do an irish jig on the roof of this truck
8118582 sergeant before i speak put your cover on and stand at parade rest you
8118583 why does he not have three points of contact why
8118584 you boys got that stressful job you pick up that shee it from the roadsides and take it apart dontcha shee it i know yall are just blowin off some steam just dont let it go too far make sure he dont fall
8118585 the whole situation is just so prudish i just cant get my mind around it in this day and age
8118586 youd think we were back in victorian times or something
8118587 i just think that its astonishing in this day and age that these people may think that theyre moral guardians
8118588 e a ana lucia em homenagem nossa musa que anda sumida tudo bom como que tu t tranq ilo o que t fazendo t em casa cansada n o t a fim de dar uma aloprada e o tes o como anda

8118599 this is great i own lots of dvds but i hate taking them out of the cases theyre so easy to damage with your service i can just make backups on cheap cds
8118600 ten reasons why it makes sense to download college movie online
8118601 ive had a lot of trouble with other services but yours just works no more headaches trying to find that one movie that no one seems to have thanks guys

8118604 were really looking forward to our movies being accepted by the western audiences
8118605 it gives them some sort of stake in the whole hollywood ecosystem
8118606 and with that they get to know how hollywood functions and what they do and dont do
8118607 were really looking forward to our movies being accepted by the western audiences
8118608 it gives them some sort of stake in the whole hollywood ecosystem

8118619 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8118620 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8118621 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8118622 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8118623 youre pretty cool id imagine you to be one of the few game programmers who actually gets laid once in a while
8118624 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8118625 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8118626 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8118627 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8118628 sorry charlie all we can think to do is have you impersonate people with charisma hopefully some will rub off
8118629 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8118630 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8118631 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8118632 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense

8118635 i often quote myself it adds spice to my conversation
8118636 there is insufficient evidence that there was any kind of a plot or a threat but well keep an open mind as we look snip
8118637 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
8118638 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
8118639 i have to reach my arms outstretched to you because i know were through so go away go away and leave me on my own
8118640 i do not see why man should not be just as cruel as nature
8118641 kami membuat kebijakan tersebut agar mereka yang ada dalam dpt bisa datang ke tps tunjukkan identitas dan mereka bisa memilih
8118642 distribusi logistic sudah berjalan dan kami menunggu itu selesai dulu kalau memang nantinya setelah dievaluasi banyak yang tidak mendapat c6 kwk baru kita akan buat kebijakan khsuus
8118643 kalau ada himbauan seperti ini jangan janagan ada itikad kurang baik dari penyelenggara untuk tidak mendistribusikan kartu kepada pemilih
8118644 taken into account the expression of free will by the ossetian and abkhaz peoples
8118645 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8118646 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
8118647 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8118648 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8118649 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
8118650 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
8118651 the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to change the borders of europe by force
8118652 a blatant attempt to legalise the results of ethnic cleansing which russian troops are continuing to commit right now as we speak and that have been committed during the last several years
8118653 throwing out the remaining population destroying the villages killing and raping and looting people
8118654 this is 21st century brutal invasion and 21st century large scale ethnic cleansing
8118655 how can the world allow them to get away with this
8118656 this is an unparalleled challenge by russia of international law and order
8118657 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8118658 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8118659 villagers had asked the militants to surrender before they laid siege
8118660 but the militants requested safe passage that was denied then the militants threw a hand grenade in the direction of the villagers to break the siege
8118661 we fear the taliban could replicate the same in buner if they were given a free hand we have held several meetings and decided that we wouldnt let buner go swats way
8118662 we are seeing the writing on the wall if we dont prevent the taliban at this stage there is every possibility the military would launch an operation and the 11million population would be migrating in a state of helplessness to safer areas
8118663 the taliban had already bombed about a dozen girls schools besides bombing 50 cd shops and attacking police stations
8118664 before the taliban resorts to torching more schools we have decided to resist them
8118665 we are not going to let the taliban play with the future of our people we dont want schools to be burnt and our coming generations uneducated
8118666 the good news is that all the political parties are supporting the move because it has paid off in the context of buner
8118667 all the criminals in these areas are carrying out anti social activities in the garb of the taliban the taliban used to be students of religious schools who guided the people on the right path but now the situation is quite the opposite they are leading anti social activities
8118668 we will kill any person seen after midnight we have advised the local population not to come out of their houses
8118669 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8118670 for the hurt and damage they have suffered as a result
8118671 while atf is a huge factor in the losses for indian carriers overcapacity is really the moot cause of the problems kingfisher is doing the right thing given current market conditions
8118672 siento alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer pero una inmensa tristeza porque otros no pueden contarlo
8118673 cuando tenemos un proyecto hay que esperar a obtener subvenciones si no no podemos hacer nada

8118676 qu consecuencias podr a haber tenido si me hubiera esperado hasta septiembre con la pierna vendada y en alto y sin saber lo que realmente me hab a pasado
8118677 en este centro me dijeron que de los tres especialistas solo estaba operativo uno durante agosto
8118678 all no se explicaban que no pudieran atenderme hasta septiembre
8118679 en el servicio de atenci n al paciente comprend an mi situaci n pero me dijeron que no pod an hacer nada porque la cita era para el 4 de septiembre
8118680 siento alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer pero una inmensa tristeza porque otros no pueden contarlo
8118681 en el lugar que se al no hab a restos y la cabeza estaba a n caliente manchada de barro y todav a sangraba lo que demuestra que acababa de ser abatido
8118682 se trata de un furtivo profesional y muy da ino
8118683 siento alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer pero una inmensa tristeza porque otros no pueden contarlo
8118684 es bastante com n saber que el polonio 210 est en los cigarrillos porque est presente en muchos tipos de plantas incluyendo en las frambuesas
8118685 hay un estudio de 1977 que encontr que de la cantidad de polonio 210 encontrada en un fumador un 77 3 por ciento proced a de la comida y un 17 por ciento del tabaco
8118686 siento alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer pero una inmensa tristeza porque otros no pueden contarlo
8118687 se centraron sobre todo en la tecnolog a electr nica de los coches las radios o los navegadores fueron algunos de los objetos que se llevaron las cosas baratas ni las tocaron
8118688 he tenido mucha suerte mi coche estaba junto al de mi hermana y sin embargo no le hicieron nada ignoro que es lo que pudo ocurrir tal vez se asustaron por alg n ruido lo que resulta evidente es que no fueron vistos por los vecinos de la fresneda
8118689 los ladrones sab an que era un sitio en el que pod an actuar con facilidad ya que no tiene buena visibilidad
8118690 no podemos funcionar con tan solo un par de guardias civiles para toda la comarca del matarra a ser a bueno reforzar la seguridad de estos municipios durante la temporada estival adem s no es la primera vez que en la fresneda ocurre un suceso de este tipo hace unos a os tambi n se produjeron varios robos en algunos coches
8118691 alguna vez se han producido robos en otras naves pero nunca pensamos que nos pasar a a nosotros ya que tan solo tenemos maquinaria de obra curiosamente unos d as antes del suceso decidimos guardar en el almac n todas las herramientas que ten amos en la obra ya que pens bamos que all iban a estar m s seguras iron as del destino
8118692 the suggestion that china will experience a post olympics slowdown has become a focus of concern with many pointing out that host nations typically experience slower growth after the games
8118693 economic growth is slowing toward the single digit realm as export growth slows and the trade surplus narrows recent data suggest that the slowdown from the export sector may be rippling across the economy new orders at factories have declined and the countrys property market has seen a sharp drop in transaction volumes
8118694 in reality chinas economic and financial market challenges have little to do with the olympics and more to do with slowing global demand rising input costs and domestic imbalances
8118695 amounts to merely a tiny fraction of chinas fixed asset investment
8118696 we dont believe it will be caused by olympics related activities
8118697 growth peaked in the second quarter of 2007 when real gdp grew by 12 6 year on year propelled by both strong domestic investment and exports since then growth has slowed every quarter reaching 10 1 year on year in q2 2008

8118704 growth peaked in the second quarter of 2007 when real gdp grew by 12 6 year on year propelled by both strong domestic investment and exports since then growth has slowed every quarter reaching 10 1 year on year in q2 2008
8118705 better airport facilities subway networks roads and recreational venues will all help to support continued rapid development
8118706 im in the jewish book of famous people but as far as you know on the professional level i think its pretty common knowledge that im half black or whatever i was never really fazed by the sort of the color barrier you know
8118707 one of the funniest experiences i had when i began working in the art world is that people always assumed i worked for thelma golden not that i was thelma golden the kind of dismissal that comes from just peoples sense that they dont imagine you are who you are actually has been one of the most powerful and liberating things for me in my work
8118708 theres always going to kind of be an overreaction one way or the other regarding your presence be it good or bad
8118709 what you tend not to see are films on black people radiating in the pleasure of their success and telling their stories
8118710 you come to the point whenever you see a black person on television its either a comedy or some tragic issue being spoken to you wouldnt think that black people could get through a competently managed day let alone being successful at it
8118711 it cant be all over as long as we have young african american boys and girls who are not able to get the quality education they need
8118712 or are still being held back because people are looking down on them
8118713 siento alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer pero una inmensa tristeza porque otros no pueden contarlo
8118714 government intervention in the economy and a degree of protectionism will be needed in the early stages of development
8118715 one of the most effective and talented propagandists of our times
8118716 bila bahagia mulai menyentuh seakan ku bisa hidup lebih lama namun harus ku tinggalkan cinta itu ketika ku bersujud
8118717 un debilitamiento adicional es probable mientras el ojo se desplace por tierra pero se fortalecer de nuevo cuando comience a moverse sobre el agua esta noche o en la ma ana del mi rcoles
8118718 the biggest problem with the hold on the title is were not going to do plastic man without ethan
8118719 thats the rule now i dont see the reason to do it plastic man can do guest star appearances here and there but there is no sense doing the book without ethan hes the most passionate about it
8118720 also plastic man is a character that i hate to say it but he needs star power to draw attention to his title and with ethans support and what he brings to the table thats the way to do the book but naturally with everything going on with the flash rebirth and other projects floating around its just a matter of time of getting into it more than anything else
8118721 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
8118722 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
8118723 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breastfeeding their infants
8118724 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
8118725 for the theatre to see their audience members reaction and hear their feedback on the scripts at an early stage of development is key to the playwrights work as they continue to write
8118726 since our audiences are given such early access to our plays they have a very intimate relationship with them even if the story being told is not their particular story
8118727 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8118728 some days i walk down the street and go god i was in that expletive band unbelievable it is
8118729 he was such a lovable guy a total cornball who specialized in bad puns and corny jokes
8118730 this is not your typical rock guy on drugs story he was really struggling but we know he definitely wasnt trying to check out
8118731 foley was a beautiful and gentle soul the kind of dude that strange things happened to
8118732 all over but the shouting an oral history of the replacements
8118733 they looked at each other and went youre already in
8118734 youre out of your element youre like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie
8118735 voters seem to take a dim view of officials breaking the law and it usually gets resolved at the next election
8118736 i believe i can and should finish out my term thats where i stand right now but bottom line theres a lot to consider here ive let a lot of people down
8118737 i made a mistake in thinking i hadnt had too much to drink before getting behind the wheel i would not have driven had i thought i was over the limit but thats a mistake im going to pay the consequences for
8118738 beyond that i am working and making progress in my personal life i think thats all that needs to be said on that
8118739 i have had my struggles with drinking but ive made pretty big strides and i am going to reinitiate counseling
8118740 i would hope he would resign on his own and thats what i told him myself
8118741 i told i would hope you take steps to take care of yourself and get some help
8118742 i feel for him and my heart goes out to him but at the same time youve committed to representing the people and when you drink and drive you put people in harms way
8118743 we all like him hes a very intelligent guy but i think it would be appropriate for him to resign and get help for himself
8118744 i am happiest when i am reaching people for christ
8118745 i believe that all christians the church its pastors and leaders have a great responsibility we are all fulfilling the great commission
8118746 it has made a whole difference in my life and improved my relationship with my husband
8118747 many of the farm workers are kids 16 to 17 years old and have left their homelands they have no family and no papers the church is everything to them their brothers and their sisters
8118748 among the serious problems they face today is a lack of education the ability to speak the english language and proper documentation
8118749 we praise god for the ones that are being reached and are living a new life but we still need to reach those who do not know christ
8118750 we had no food in our house until the pastor came
8118751 we would really like to find a home off of st croix so this snake will not pose any further threat to the island ecology
8118752 many people purchase these snakes when they are small and cute without fully grasping how big they can get and the level of care that they must provide
8118753 oftentimes when the snake becomes too much to handle the owner will free it into the bush
8118754 if i go to the cricket and were going a bit rough therell be wags in the outer telling me to jump the fence
8118755 it doesnt really surprise me we get primary school kids who want to come in and see don bradmans bat and cap like they go to melbourne museum and see phar lap
8118756 its a rite of passage for australian school students you learn about phar lap and you learn about don bradman
8118757 it was to the point where i know for a fact he was very upset about a scene in the series where i had a beer after a test win
8118758 can i have your autograph before its too late for both of us
8118759 we havent had a martin luther king or nelson mandela
8118760 like michael jordan and now michael phelps hes someone who made such a mark on their chosen sport and made worldwide impact so in our culture hes hero worshipped
8118761 i never heard about his bad behaviour in india we love sir donald
8118762 when i wrote a book to impress my harvard colleagues nothing new but noone will know because noone can understand it sucka
8118763 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8118764 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8118765 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance live blog rudds big plan
8118766 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8118767 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8118768 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8118769 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8118770 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8118771 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8118772 this culture must also be matched to effective transparency and accountability mechansims that meet the needs of parents policy makers and the broader community
8118773 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensics and ordinary old police detective work
8118774 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometimes it could even be the wrong house
8118775 you shoot into a house you never know where the bullets are going to go i believe he was in bed
8118776 i am here tonight as a proud mother and a proud democrat and a proud senator from new york and a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8118777 my friends it is time to take back a country we love and whether you voted for me or whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8118778 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8118779 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8118780 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8118781 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8118782 twin of hugely unpopular republican us president george w bush
8118783 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8118784 i thought she was outstanding the illinois senator said after watching clintons convention speech in denver at the home of local supporters
8118785 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election he said
8118786 you can entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience
8118787 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief tucker bounds spokesman for senaotr mccain said
8118788 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8118789 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president

8118811 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
8118812 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend

8118829 how long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well
8118830 that such creatures could be weaponized and the possibility according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project that these cyborg insects might be armed with bio weapons
8118831 its been a hard year but the olympic doubles gold really gave me a great lift and im really inspired to do well here
8118832 i really hope i can stick around for some time
8118833 its stupid rules that somebody made in 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8118834 how can a guy see a foot fault with sunglasses from 35 feet metres away it doesnt make any sense
8118835 i am very happy to be back healthy playing well and winning the first round is always great fun
8118836 but its been a hard year especially the beginning and it was difficult trying to get back into rhythm
8118837 i played really well on clay and grass but not so good early on in the hardcourt sesason i think the olympics doubles gold gave me a great lift and i am really inspired to do well here
8118838 ill definitely be living off that moment for a while its going to take me a year to come down off that
8118839 serena and i we did talk because we love the olympics so much we were saying oh wow we just want to play this forever
8118840 so we talked about playing the 2016 olympics who knows maybe by then well have a life and not be chasing a ball maybe well have kids
8118841 if not even if so maybe well still try to play
8118842 i started thinking about that this year especially with number five i started thinking why is it that my first serve percentage is at least in the 60s at wimbledon and all this great stuff
8118843 but i dont know just maybe its the love of my life
8118844 i felt through the whole tournament that i didnt play worth a dime and i felt like oh im playing so bad
8118845 so to be able to win and think that i wasnt even playing well i thought no matter what the circumstance i can win so ever since then i definitely have been a lot more relaxed coming into tournaments
8118846 the last few years have kind of been in and out
8118847 out for a few months and in for a few months im looking forward to having the opportunity to just keep playing throughout the year
8118848 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive

8118855 he was walking on the sidewalk when he received a gunshot would to the head
8118856 our detectives in violent crimes dont have any leads they dont have a motive or anything that leads them to believe that he was specifically targeted it appears at this point that it could have been random
8118857 anywhere it can happen not only just around here but anywhere so yeah its pretty scary

8118915 this consolidation of service isnt limited to southwest airlines and its not limited to manchester boston regional airport
8118916 as the airport operator we are very concerned any time we lose service
8118917 after march 6 theres a possibility of these flights being added back in as we ramp up for spring break travel and the summer
8118918 we have proven time and time again that the boston north market remains very very strong and the preference in the boston north market is to travel out of manchester boston regional airport rather than some other airport in the region
8118919 we feel we are well positioned to recover some of those flights and some of those seats
8118920 we werent causing any trouble or anything we were just out for a walk
8118921 it would have been nice if they had given us a warning there are a lot of people who dont know there is a curfew
8118922 its the speeding the loud mufflers the loud radios the illegally parked vehicles these are the kind of things that upset people and they call and complain about it
8118923 the theory is you can head off a lot of the more serious quality of life issues by addressing the day in and day out issues
8118924 its a little early especially with so much stuff going on downtown with the verizon and all the restaurants its a very romantic thing after dinner to walk around a little bit and chat

8118926 were not the type of people who rob and steal and cause trouble
8118927 a lot of us are afraid to go home because of the simple fact that there is no one home at night

8119175 ya allah penuhilah untukku apa yang kau janjikan ya allah datangkanlah kepadaku apa yang kau janjikan ya allah jika kamu binasakan sekelompok ahlul islam ini maka engkau tidak disembah di muka bumi
8119176 wahai nabi allah telah cukup permohonanmu kepada allah sesungguhnya dia akan memberikan untukmu apa yang dia janjikan kepadamu
8119177 ingatlah ketika kamu memohon pertolongan kepada rabbmu lalu diperkenankan nya bagimu
8119178 dan janganlah kamu berjalan di muka bumi ini dengan sombong karena sesungguhnya kamu sekali kali tidak dapat menembus bumi dan sekali kali kamu tidak akan sampai setinggi gunung
8119179 dan kami hadapi segala amal yang mereka kerjakan lalu kami jadikan amal itu bagaikan debu yang berterbangan

8119210 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8119211 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8119212 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect west virginia gov joe manchin used his role as chair of the democratic governors association to promote obama in appalachia a region where obama suffered major losses
8119213 west virginians value hard work patriotism and faith in god they mine the coal make the steel and work the assembly lines that make our industries tick their experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life they can shake your hand look you in the eye and touch your heart
8119214 and let me tell you something they cant afford four more years like the last eight they need and deserve better from washington
8119215 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8119216 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up

8119269 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8119270 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8119271 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8119272 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him

8119309 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8119310 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8119311 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8119312 he was playing cricket in the schoolyard here and he tried to stop the principal ringing the school bell to end lunch
8119313 he bet his friends that he could stop the principal from ringing the bell

8119315 it was great honour to know when i walked in that there was a photo of sir donald in the foyer it was wonderful in some ways i felt home
8119316 in those days there was no electric street lighting no electricity
8119317 one of sir dons favourite recollections was how he used to ride on the gas lighters horse lighting the street lamps
8119318 well knowing how modest he was he probably would have been overwhelmed by it all no doubt
8119319 the accusations are baseless and do not make sense the bank of china will respond to the suit to clarify and ensure a correct understanding of the facts by going through the legal procedures

8119324 this issue of the ageing of australia and the cost of the ageing of australia is a greater crisis than climate change but its not as sexy a subject as climate change and most people in australia would prefer not to grow old and die
8119325 were calling on the government and the opposition to give this the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt with the issue of a massively ageing population
8119326 we pension them off and tell them to sit in front of their television set and watch home and away while the nation goes to the pot economically
8119327 this nation has to face the fact that we cannot economically sustain a retirement age of 65
8119328 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8119329 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8119330 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8119331 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8119332 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8119333 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8119334 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8119335 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8119336 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
8119337 it is essential that we see new ir laws introduced into parliament that scrap the rest of work choices and ensure all workers especially women get back their rights at work
8119338 pay equity is not just about equal pay for equal work the gender wage gap reveals the systemic discrimination in the under valuation of womens work
8119339 the impact of pay inequity in our society is costly not only to women but also to families government and the community

8119347 hes the youngest member of the senate but time says that hasnt limited his reach
8119348 i think its important to recognize that he is desperately trying not to talk about these issues because he has been an architect of the bush plan that has driven the economy into the ground and hurt new hampshire families

8119365 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
8119366 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
8119367 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables

8119372 the key opportunity to get out of poverty is to move and go somewhere else
8119373 it always has been a crucial part of australias history its becoming very difficult and the debate on migration is very much looking at migration as a threat and not as an opportunity

8119378 the khpa is very aware of the sensitive information we have and use to purchase health care for 360 000 kansans
8119379 they say we should have health insurance they say this every four years and i dont see anything being done
8119380 a lot of the fall in the uninsured is due to the increase in public health care coverage
8119381 there needs to be some federal solution at some point in time its just so costly it cant go on forever
8119382 most people get it that were one or two paychecks away from not having health care if we lose our jobs that health insurance we take as a given becomes very problematic
8119383 both presidential candidates are saying we can no longer avoid this discussion it has to be on the front burner
8119384 healthmax does that and much more by making health insurance affordable
8119385 the congressmans proposal will not significantly reduce the number of uninsured missourians
8119386 therefore it is unlikely to significantly drive down the cost of insurance for missouri families
8119387 what were looking for is a partial solution to a huge problem
8119388 if this takes us in that direction thats a good thing
8119389 jay nixon put forward a plan to drive down health care costs for families significantly reduce the number of uninsured and expand coverage to children in our state

8119393 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8119394 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8119395 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8119396 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8119397 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8119398 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8119399 we are confident that we can capture the majority of the margin improvement that will come from the upturn in the markets through to the net profit line when those investment returns finally turn around
8119400 the overwhelming driver of our funds balance this year has regrettably been the negative investment returns
8119401 but theres no doubt that when you talk to advisers it is quieter than historically it has been
8119402 that means the fund flow to us from new clients is a little slow
8119403 we would certainly look at opportunities larger than the current cash availability inside the business
8119404 hopefully this sentence would send a clear message that there is no safe haven for drug dealers in new hampshire
8119405 he doesnt want to get back out on the street and start using again and then start selling again
8119406 he knows hes going straight to prison if he gets caught dealing drugs again
8119407 i will do whatever i need to do to avoid coming back
8119408 i will not fail myself my family or this court it will be the first and only chance i get
8119409 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8119410 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8119411 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8119412 what it really came down to was a toss up between barts catchphrase dont have a cow man and i am the lorax i speak for the trees
8119413 i decided i was more about the trees you know which is why its so crazy that years later im part of this
8119414 theyre asking three to five bucks for obama buttons so were definitely reasonable
8119415 you know the lorax was environmentalist before environmentalism was cool americans need to be reminded about the danger of being
8119416 id have to go with something more universal like the cat in the hat that book could save democracy
8119417 i really believe that it teaches us that you can make yourself whoever you want to be and if you can make yourself whoever you want to be the rest of us can come together and make the country what we want it to be we can make changes on a social level dr seuss was trying to tell us that
8119418 the cat in the hat was a non conformist but he sure knew how to clean up a mess
8119419 the cat brings a cheerful exotic and exuberant form of chaos to a household of two young children one rainy day while their mother is out
8119420 as we find our congress facing a similar situation it is clear that seusss keen observations are as relevant today as they were sixty six years ago
8119421 seuss said im not anti military im just anti crazy
8119422 can you imagine if we could elect dr seuss and he got a chance to re write the constitution
8119423 we might actually get a chance to start addressing the important issues and it would be full of cool rhymes
8119424 i dont want to get in any trouble over there
8119425 one in three women in this country will be affected by rape abuse or be killed
8119426 by 2040 hispanics will be a majority in the united states
8119427 we celebrate the fact that not only can women vote but women can vote for other women in elected office
8119428 my right to choose was taken away when i was given a radical hysterectomy to cure my cancer
8119429 i hate that i lost my right to choose and you will too
8119430 obamas health plan centers around tax credits that will ensure that health insurance is available and affordable for all families
8119431 a new refundable 50 percent health tax credit on employee premiums paid by employers
8119432 to match 50 of the first 1 000 of savings for families that earn under 75 000
8119433 low income families to receive up to a 50 percent credit on the first 6 000 of child care expenses
8119434 increase the number of working parents eligible for eitc benefits increase the benefits available to noncustodial parents who fulfill their child support obligations increase benefits for families with three or more children and reduce the eitc marriage penalty which hurts low income families
8119435 veto every pork laden spending bill and make their authors famous
8119436 in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise
8119437 there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
8119438 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
8119439 the language in the platform is a real step forward for those women who want to take the child to term it strongly supports that choice and provides necessary support
8119440 reaffirms in the strongest of terms the democratic partys solid commitment to a womans right to choose as defined by roe v wade
8119441 no debates changes or amendments were raised related to a womans right to choose
8119442 the democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
8119443 i dont think we can continue with the schizophrenic view that we have today sort of part public company part private company where the leaders of the company do well when things are going well but then the government and the public and the taxpayer has to bail them out when it goes bad
8119444 the fact is that we have to have a clear definition of what the mission of freddie and fannie is and if it is to serve the public than it ought to be owned by the public where the risk and rewards are controlled by the public
8119445 the insider threat to critical infrastructures constitutes a real and significant threat because of the potential a trusted insider has to inflict serious damage including cascading and cross sector effects and economic interruptions from critical infrastructure service losses while many critical infrastructure operators have programs or measures in place addressing this threat to some degree others do not fully understand or appreciate the threat posed by insiders both to their company and also to our nation the report provides recommendations for government policy to help improve the security posture of u s critical infrastructures against this threat the recommendations include low cost easily implemented policy solutions for near term effect the niac recommends that policy makers move swiftly to implement the near term improvements and increase the security of our critical infrastructures
8119446 one run after the catch i think hes gotten better with his speed and athletic ability after he catches the ball
8119447 the other area i thought he really improved in the spring is in the blocking area of it hes become more physical hes got to improve on the blocking to become an all around tight end for us
8119448 for a big kid he could really run and when you threw him the ball he caught it
8119449 for me i want to do anything to help the team
8119450 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
8119451 although ocean acidification is affecting the health of our oceans the same thing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is going to in fact be affecting terrestrial environments also

8119462 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8119463 hes sleeping better than ever because he thinks and i quote americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8119464 and would you believe he said last week that the fundamentals of the economy are strong john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been part of the middle class and i would say to him senator mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
8119465 weve had a democratic governor and a democratic majority in congress for nearly two years but gas is 4 a gallon unemployment is at a 15 year high and businesses are running from ohio
8119466 its time to stop pointing fingers and start providing leadership
8119467 you cant say enough about the pass protection this preseason quarterback j
8119468 the one sack against chicago was more of a coverage sack than anything else if i had to do it all over again i probably could have thrown the ball away

8119474 are you doing it for me or for the people who inspire me
8119475 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there you can go under the radar a little bit
8119476 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8119477 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flame history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance
8119478 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear but at the same time i played enough games here to know what kind of fan base and what kind of team they are
8119479 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8119480 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8119481 i said to todd does this remind you of vancouver a little bit he said yeah here we go again
8119482 i havent played a home game on canadian soil since i was 16 years old so i think the whole idea of canadians knowledge of the game their love their passion for the sport is how i grew up

8119490 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe
8119491 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8119492 this is not the end of the story in georgia
8119493 russia wants to aggravate rather than calm down passions this is an extremely alarming development
8119494 end of the epoch of a weak russia and restores a multipolar world order
8119495 russia has no such goals it will be up to south ossetia and abkhazia
8119496 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8119497 all my life i have been waiting for this moment
8119498 theyve run a model franchise and i think everyone in pittsburgh recognizes how proud they are of the steelers and we in the nfl recognize how fortunate we have been to have dan rooneys leadership and now arts leadership
8119499 that is certainly a consideration the ownership of other clubs wants to make sure this team is going to be run consistently with those principles and if dan rooney wants an opportunity to continue to run the franchise i think thats an interest that some of the owners have
8119500 but i think these are issues because of their complexity and because theres clear emotional issues here we have to be patient but firm with respect to getting these resolved

8119512 its a desperate attempt by the minister and this government to avoid scrutiny of helen clarks decision to keep winston peters on as minister of foreign affairs
8119513 i am looking forward to the time we have a prime minister who puts the country first that actually stands up for some principles that actually sets some standards for ministers and that ministers arent allowed to just tell any old pork pie that they like
8119514 he mr broad has no proposals to introduce any changes to the current situation immediately in fact all he is saying is i am going to seek mps opinions
8119515 at a time when police are feeling isolated from the communities they are recruited from and live in this ideologically driven denial of democratic rights enjoyed by every other new zealander including public servants just aggravates that feeling of isolation
8119516 the policing bill went through more than two years of community consultation and development and the government policy after that process was that police should be able to serve on councils
8119517 now it has decided at the 11th hour with no consultation to reverse that policy and undermine the rights of every new zealand police officer
8119518 any substantive reason whatsoever for the about face other than a desire to satisfy new zealand first
8119519 i think the public will look at the reality and make up its own mind
8119520 it is a different matter with community boards which act in a purely advisory way and which are quite suitable bodies for police employees to play an active part in
8119521 quite frankly i am very disappointed association president greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8119522 police believed until the very last minute that labour opposed nz firsts bid to deny them the right to serve on councils but that was before they snuck their u turn clause into the policing bill

8119555 theres hardly a government head thats not a lesbian so many lesbians are in top jobs and they dont want to acknowledge any sex
8119556 its a neutralisation of sex instead of saying foreman or forewoman
8119557 he also hopes mps agree that his approach is the most appropriate one for responding to the issues of risk to the public and to the police and for continuing the tradition of having a routinely unarmed police service a value closely held by new zealanders
8119558 police say that the tasers built in recording mechanisms provide enhanced auditing opportunities and the recent availability of cameras with the device provides even greater reassurance around deployment if complaints are made

8119561 everybody is touched by cancer thats no lie if they could only find a cure that would be lovely
8119562 this is heading down the track of privatisation of water and creating ownership rights so it can be traded the labour led government would not support such a move as we believe water is owned by all new zealanders
8119563 the danger in the business councils trading system is that it could overshadow the rights of ordinary people to have a say for example about rivers and streams they wish to swim or fish in and drink from
8119564 we are simply talking about allowing water that is not being used that is available for consumption or commercial use to move to another commercial use
8119565 recent cost projections show that if an lwr were to be imported from france the cost of electricity would be too high for the indian consumer this is because of the high capital cost of french supplied equipment

8119626 as a consequence of the improvements in price data collection and processing we have discovered that the cost of living is higher in the developing world than we thought
8119627 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one per centage point a year since 1981
8119628 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8119629 i think thats a lot of money to spend on education
8119630 word of mouth is a really good form of communication

8119632 he made a mistake hes accepted responsibility for the mistake and hes moving on

8119636 the district magistrates will decide the timing for curfew relaxation in consultation with the security forces in order to ensure that the people can move about without any hindrance during the relaxation period

8119639 a high alert has been sounded in jammu due to the infiltration by three terrorists from across the international border
8119640 this is a serious situation the intruders sneaked into the indian side under the cover of fire which was most probably provided by the pakistani rangers
8119641 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
8119642 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8119643 you know what i wish i wish that all the scum of the earth had one throat and i had my hands around it
8119644 get over it betty had cancer on her head you knew that
8119645 chancellors and presidents of universities and colleges across the united states
8119646 as a consequence of the improvements in price data collection and processing we have discovered that the cost of living is higher in the developing world than we thought
8119647 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one per centage point a year since 1981
8119648 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8119649 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8119650 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8119651 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8119652 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8119653 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8119654 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8119655 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8119656 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8119657 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8119658 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8119659 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8119660 we anticipate that the market will continue to be volatile with softening demand for wine in australia and fierce competition in all of our markets
8119661 the economic conditions in the uk in particular and the us are also likely to impact demand
8119662 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8119663 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8119664 improving confidence is the first critical step in seeing that spiral broken and help mitigate extreme swings in the cycle
8119665 universal sports the olympic channel co owned by nbc and intermedia partners will offer the first ever tv and digital broadcast of the paralympic games courtesy of an agreement with bocog and the international paralympic committee
8119666 the paralympic games begin in beijing on sept 6 they will feature 4 000 athletes from 150 countries in 20 sports
8119667 olympic play by play commentator al trautwig will host the coverage of the 2008 paralympics
8119668 while the benefits of these increased coal prices did have a positive impact on 2007 08 revenues primarily the last few months the benefits are anticipated to accrue substantially in 2008 09 and beyond
8119669 both demand and prices for coal are likely to stay strong and within this context i am confident we will be able to further increase our revenues and profitability in the coming years
8119670 we are confident that we can capture the majority of the margin improvement that will come from the upturn in the markets through to the net profit line when those investment returns finally turn around
8119671 the overwhelming driver of our funds balance this year has regrettably been the negative investment returns
8119672 but theres no doubt that when you talk to advisers it is quieter than historically it has been
8119673 that means the fund flow to us from new clients is a little slow
8119674 we would certainly look at opportunities larger than the current cash availability inside the business
8119675 every participant on the expedition has been affected by bipolar in some way
8119676 be that they are directly suffering from the condition working in the mental health sector or having a close friend or family member affected by the disease for me losing my uncle earlier this year to the illness made a huge impact on me
8119677 jason is doing an amazing thing to raise money for this cause how many people do you know that would endure blistering minus forty degree conditions in order to raise some money for charity hes going where few have dared to go before and that why were doing all we can to support him
8119678 as im sure you can imagine an adventure like this doesnt come easily especially for a student
8119679 hopefully with a little help from the local community im sure i can make it there
8119680 i believe that the expedition will be an awesome adventure that really parallels the extremes of the disorder and will show that people suffering from this mental illness can not only lead normal lives but can go on to do extraordinary things
8119681 dankzij de mensen van studio voetbal die het zo nodig tien keer moesten herhalen moet ik voor komende maandag een verklaring inleveren
8119682 ik geef eerlijk toe dat het op de beelden behoorlijk wild lijkt maar het was echt geen opzet ik kwam gewoon niet goed uit met mijn passen nicky hofs was net iets eerder bij de bal daarom raakte ik hem per ongeluk flink maar absoluut niet met de intentie hem te blesseren daarom reken ik erop dat de aanklager na het lezen van de verklaringen afziet van een straf
8119683 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8119684 het was een initiatief van de amateursectie omdat ik zo veel mogelijk goede mensen voor de knvb wil behouden stond ik achter een dergelijke constructie en een volgens mij ook zeker werkbare situatie maar in een persoonlijk onderhoud met van praag vond hij de constructie niet werkbaar en wees het voorstel af
8119685 ik heb hem daarop aangesproken en gezegd dat dit pertinente onzin is
8119686 ik heb voor de olympische spelen met mijn volle verstand een handtekening onder dit contract gezet dan moet je daarvan de consequenties aanvaarden en je werk doen
8119687 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8119688 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8119689 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8119690 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8119691 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8119692 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8119693 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8119694 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home
8119695 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
8119696 i read about that last night hillary is going to be pissed i wonder what sort of damning info will come out about obama
8119697 a prominent philadelphia attorney and hillary clinton supporter filed suit this afternoon in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against illinois sen barack obama the democratic national committee and the
8119698 she was not asked for a single piece of paper
8119699 in response to a sharp increase in demand for solar power generation systems
8119700 i think hillary clinton really hit all the right notes she did a magnificent job reminding everyone she asked her supporters the right question did you work so hard just for me or was it for all the causes that we believe in
8119701 if it was not just for me if it was for the causes we all believe in then you must support barack obama as president
8119702 tears did come to my eyes it was very emotional but she called us to action to do the right thing and there really is no choice obviously we have to do whats right for our children and our grandchildren
8119703 it was unifying it was articulate and with the wording she hit on every necessary target
8119704 it took delegates like me who are staunch hillary supporters and over the course of 20 minutes moved us into becoming staunch obama supporters
8119705 its one thing to say that im going to vote for barack obama in the fall its another thing to say im going to do it with a full heart and thats what hillary clinton did for me tonight
8119706 theres no question in my mind that she had to touch every heart that cast a vote for her this year but i will say this it means that the obama people in the campaign will have to reach out to the rank and file who supported hillary in the campaign
8119707 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8119708 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8119709 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8119710 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8119711 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8119712 the accusations are baseless and do not make sense the bank of china will respond to the suit to clarify and ensure a correct understanding of the facts by going through the legal procedures
8119713 we will reserve the right to lodge a counter claim and other necessary legal actions we believe the us court will make just rulings in accordance with the law and the facts
8119714 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8119715 delivered great papers and has done a magnificent job in reinvigorating the age
8119716 the company is discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8119717 the editorial leadership team have my highest confidence i know they will excel in leading the editorial staff of the age to ensure the ages continuing success
8119718 you cant stop somebody from nairobi from reading it its on the web theyre going to notice and say id quite like to do that i can do that and they apply to come well that is terrific
8119719 its pretty good for coffs harbour its pretty good for the person in nairobi
8119720 its empowering people and the character of people movement is going to change and its essentially going to be an enhancing and enriching thing both economically and socially
8119721 some people dont like that and are really worried about it and i have to say to them its going to be very disappointing century
8119722 the key opportunity to get out of poverty is to move and go somewhere else
8119723 it always has been a crucial part of australias history its becoming very difficult and the debate on migration is very much looking at migration as a threat and not as an opportunity
8119724 at least somethings goods happening in australia with this migrant workers scheme theres not much good news on this topic elsewhere
8119725 i dont know if the comics are any good because i never see them in shops or read many reviews of them anywhere
8119726 our books are cool sci fi retellings of ancient myths plus random hollywood concepts with actors names plastered on the front and oh yeah dan dare
8119727 this issue of the ageing of australia and the cost of the ageing of australia is a greater crisis than climate change but its not as sexy a subject as climate change and most people in australia would prefer not to grow old and die
8119728 were calling on the government and the opposition to give this the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt with the issue of a massively ageing population
8119729 we pension them off and tell them to sit in front of their television set and watch home and away while the nation goes to the pot economically
8119730 this nation has to face the fact that we cannot economically sustain a retirement age of 65
8119731 i believe the longer you work the longer you live the quicker that you retire the quicker you get into a geriatric hospital
8119732 since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8119733 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8119734 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8119735 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8119736 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8119737 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8119738 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8119739 he was playing cricket in the schoolyard here and he tried to stop the principal ringing the school bell to end lunch
8119740 he bet his friends that he could stop the principal from ringing the bell
8119741 i feel very privileged to be here as principal of the school on this 100th anniversary
8119742 it was great honour to know when i walked in that there was a photo of sir donald in the foyer it was wonderful in some ways i felt home
8119743 in those days there was no electric street lighting no electricity
8119744 one of sir dons favourite recollections was how he used to ride on the gas lighters horse lighting the street lamps
8119745 well knowing how modest he was he probably would have been overwhelmed by it all no doubt
8119746 all don ever wanted was a quiet life i think that probably comes from his background here in bowral
8119747 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
8119748 it is essential that we see new ir laws introduced into parliament that scrap the rest of work choices and ensure all workers especially women get back their rights at work
8119749 pay equity is not just about equal pay for equal work the gender wage gap reveals the systemic discrimination in the under valuation of womens work
8119750 the impact of pay inequity in our society is costly not only to women but also to families government and the community
8119751 august 27 is the focus of an ongoing campaign for eowa to educate the community about the causes and solutions of pay equity
8119752 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8119753 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8119754 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8119755 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8119756 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8119757 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8119758 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8119759 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8119760 to make a real difference we anticipate that governments will need to commit to additional investments of around 500 000 a year for an average sized school
8119761 en intagen p s ter ska inte enligt min mening ha tillg ng till egen mobiltelefon och internet
8119762 alliansregeringen har utlovat en lag ndring som g r att svensk polis sj lvfallet ska kunna sp ra brottslingars mobiltelefon oavsett om den r p slagen eller inte
8119763 rymningar ska sj lvklart inte ske och r n got man b r se mycket allvarligt p
8119764 att h vda att en rymning inte r m jlig inneb r f rmodligen att inte heller n gon behandling blir m jlig
8119765 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8119766 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8119767 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in
8119768 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8119769 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8119770 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8119771 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8119772 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8119773 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system
8119774 my husband and i felt strongly that we wanted our children to be in a social environment
8119775 we liked the oversight and accreditation of a center and thought it would be a lot more stable
8119776 the scant time i had alone in my office worrying about child care fretting about whether my children would grow up to feel unloved and abandoned
8119777 theres a sense that some of the big questions about day care have been answered
8119778 the concerns that youre doing a horrible thing that could harm your children are lessened
8119779 in 1991 our main question was is out of home child care bad
8119780 the scientific evidence is that parents and families have much more influence than child care arrangements on children
8119781 people now know kids whove grown up and had employed mothers
8119782 it was never a simple matter but i do think the research has brought more clarity to the complexity
8119783 but i dont think the guilt and questions will ever change or that the studies have found all the answers
8119784 child care continues to be highly undercapitalized and families are really responsible for the cost
8119785 we still need to improve the quality of child care available to most families
8119786 so all the children feel the same and it helps us id them
8119787 in every room there was classical music playing and it seemed happy and the whole environment seemed positive
8119788 one center i saw had six swings lined up in the infant room which told me my kid was going to be in one 90 percent of the time
8119789 at st anthonys there was a lot of interaction with staff and kids
8119790 if theyre home by themselves with a nanny they dont get that good problem solving
8119791 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
8119792 the economic patient is starting to show signs of life
8119793 we cannot stress the importance of confidence enough its not the key driver of wealth but is critical for maintaining momentum
8119794 i do a lot of metal work and this is a really good school for that
8119795 not a lot of universities offer glass making so its a really good range of opportunities like glass metal work sculpting ceramics they let you express yourself however you need to
8119796 good colleges have good diversity and each professor has something different to teach me
8119797 people think of themselves as individuals but depend on other people to help them feel connected
8119798 its a good way to keep track of what you have to do when you have to do it and how much time you have to spend doing it i definitely think itd be a good thing for anybody and everybody to use
8119799 this tracking system is to provide help to students who may not know they need help
8119800 i see what they are trying to do but then again some things come up and you need more than three days
8119801 we just hope that the warnings we issue will let people police themselves
8119802 we understand people have to get used to parking on campus again but after a warning people should realize where they need to go
8119803 the longest wait ive seen was a two hour line
8119804 i do my best to get out here and check to make sure people have everything they need so they dont have to wait for anything
8119805 this action will streamline the registration and submission process for those utilizing mac computers and provide better immediate feedback for which data field is missing an entry or incorrectly formatted
8119806 the lines are longer and parking is still hard to get unless you have an early or late class
8119807 we understand students are standing in line for something they dont even want and we are very thankful for that
8119808 we like to hear their feedback and hopefully improve it for them
8119809 we get quite a few residents that walk over here getting essentials they would normally get at wal mart
8119810 ive been here for the past two years and this is the busiest weve ever been
8119811 in the past two weeks business has gone up tenfold
8119812 i went there last year because i didnt want to deal with wal mart
8119813 it would be nice if some restaurants moved in there arent many places to eat on this side of town
8119814 were pleased the reserve at saluki pointe and its residents are making a meaningful contribution to business success and economic vitality in the carbondale area
8119815 he had supervised the widest range of departments of all the candidates
8119816 hes worked with first year experience programs before and was an international student himself so he should relate well to our international students
8119817 the weather is much warmer down there compared to iowa
8119818 but there are challenges at the university that i am excited to work on especially with the students
8119819 it seems like the students here really care about local and national issues which is very exciting for me
8119820 in his presentation it was obvious he has a passion for international students and it comes at a very important time where it is crucial to have a diverse staff
8119821 this has to inspire international students it sends a great message
8119822 were looking for a very small portion of the royalties that come out of this country
8119823 well thats up to the premier and the cabinet to make that decision im very certain that our government isnt going to let cloncurry run out of water
8119824 there are something like 20 or 22 permanent and or part time staff there at the hospital and at this stage i believe the primary health care centre will be run by around two and a half
8119825 queensland health cant take a service away without at least replacing it with a service better than weve already got
8119826 consequences of underage drinking are simply too significant to ignore
8119827 while ultimately the legislatures of the various states will decide this debate our view is that the consequences of underage drinking are simply too significant to ignore
8119828 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
8119829 some of them just stop there and say its illegal
8119830 unfortunately alcohol and drug use has been manufactured into showing that as ok now im an adult
8119831 it was clear to me that they didnt see this as a dialogue they saw this as some kind of effort on our part to turn our schools into party schools
8119832 if you endorse responsible drinking youre condoning certain behavior that is illegal
8119833 a college president cant take that position not if he wants to keep his job
8119834 when you watch spc tv you get the kind or programming you want when you want to watch it
8119835 heres a real environment for students to create programming and manage programming and get real life experience
8119836 i think that because there are so many people who live off campus it should be available to the town because thats definitely something id be interested in watching
8119837 generally speaking most people dont think about how complicated it is to get a show on tv
8119838 its a good outlet to actually ask questions without any judgment
8119839 it allows students to be able to call in and ask anonymously one of your peers and youll get an honest answer i think thats something students dont have right now
8119840 people interested see that students are involved and get motivation to step up and do the same thing
8119841 i think the running back position is one of our strengths
8119842 you really need three or four quality backs to carry you through the season and the depth of our backfield will allow us to be in that situation
8119843 we all have a different style but were all striving for the same goal and thats to win a national championship
8119844 any given day the offense may seem different because we have the ability to cater to the talent of the kids on the field at that particular time
8119845 the spread offense is just another wrinkle to try to promote the speed of our tailbacks
8119846 when i see a spot i got to hit it quick because it closes so fast
8119847 the hole closes so fast at my size i can squeeze through a lot of cracks before the linebackers close out
8119848 some people went public when they shouldnt have its kind of holier than thou the world has a right to know no they dont not on situations like that
8119849 williams went after us on due process he was wrong we do follow due process
8119850 what he did was he picked up various stages of the process
8119851 what is important is how it was going to end not what was going on during the discussions and he never mentioned that it was not going the way he portrayed it
8119852 we plead guilty its taking too long theres no doubt its taking too long weve got to get out with it
8119853 its been so long now i cant remember the report but obviously its always good to have a clear direct policy its really not my place to comment
8119854 in short none of the elements of due process are met in this policy and this has resulted in this simon mess the lawsuit involving cal meyers and other individuals being caught in the mix
8119855 in many cases weve got people who are using sexual harassment as a vehicle to get rid of people they dont want without giving them any due process at all in hopes that they wont make a stink about it because they dont want to have the publicity engendered by being labeled a sexual harasser
8119856 you want to accuse me of secrecy yes im guilty but you have to respect a persons reputation once it gets out right or wrong its over there will always be doubt in peoples minds about simon no matter what
8119857 if people dont get that theyre going to file suit well lose our funding from the grant association and our reputation is going to fall because were not doing the right thing
8119858 we havent had this many newcomers in avery long time
8119859 doing this trip is paramount because we can bring the newcomers along slowly we are going to bring them along as slow as we can because we have these ten days
8119860 four years ago we didnt know we would have seven new guys so i dont think you can strategically plan like that
8119861 but i think when the trip is available to you you can be smart about it we could have used this last year but we felt like we were old enough to not do it and im glad we didnt because we needed it this year
8119862 i can already see a difference in just the one week of practice that weve had if we didnt have this we would have to start in october it will be a huge help for us down the road
8119863 we have a system in place and these ten days have been used for that
8119864 we can actually slow down and walk it through with them and explain things as opposed to oct 17 when things have to be at a much quicker pace
8119865 that is one thing about this team is that we are real close
8119866 spending an extra 10 days together is only going to help us out with all the young guys learning the system we should get into the swing of things real good
8119867 you cant even get film on foreign teams so you just go in there and see how they play you which is actually better for the new guys to see how they respond
8119868 we can go into film then and see how they did with each situation and say this is what we do when this situation happens or you did this during that situation and we dont usually do that so its good
8119869 our non conference season is really one that weve worked on to get a balance between home and away contests
8119870 when i got here they recruits were a little further west
8119871 i think florida is one of those teams that is looking to take the next step up in the southeastern conference
8119872 i think we could be one of those teams that they may not pay attention to and we could sneak it away from them
8119873 florida is going to be big strong and aggressive that is just what you get when playing against the sec but we will have nothing to lose in that tournament
8119874 anyway you cut it all of those teams are playoff teams and it should be a great challenge for us
8119875 we know west nile virus historically has been in our area and were still urging people to take precautions and avoid mosquito bites
8119876 otherwise calling 20 000 people would be quite time consuming and impossible
8119877 i dont have to show my papers on demand i dont live in that kind of world
8119878 kita dapati permintaan maman semakin meningkat yang menyebabkan pengeluaran yang dihasilkan tidak mencukupi untuk memenuhi permintaan orang ramai jadi saya menggalakkan penduduk di kawasan ini mengusahakan secara komersial dengan mengusahakan tanah terbiar untuk dijadikan kebun atau ladang maman
8119879 saya mengusahakan kebun maman sejak tiga tahun lalu di kawasan seluas 1 2 hektar dengan mengusahakan secara berfasa bagi memastikan bekalan sentiasa ada dan dapat menampung permintaan pelanggan
8119880 setiap bulan kebun ini mampu menghasilkan kira kira 16 000 kilogram maman untuk dipasarkan dengan pendapatan mampu mencecah rm8 000 sebulan

8119887 well the screens about fifteen dollars but theyll have to charge you labor so id say about fifty or sixty bucks

8119903 tidak benar jika saya katakan perniagaan yang dilakukan tidak pernah dilanda kerugian namun bagi saya apa yang perlu ada dalam diri untuk berjaya adalah kita perlu kuat mental dan fizikal sekiranya dilanda cabaran
8119904 berkat kesabaran sekurang kurangnya ia dapat mematangkan kita untuk lebih berhati hati dalam memastikan perniagaan yang diceburi beroleh kejayaan
8119905 jika dahulu saya menjalankan perniagaan ini di dalam rumah hasil daripada bantuan yang diberikan oleh jabatan kemajuan masyarakat kemas dan jabatan pertanian daerah muar kini saya mampu membina sebuah kilang bertutup yang mula beroperasi sejak tahun lalu
8119906 dengan 20 pekerja sambilan termasuk dua pekerja tetap kami bertungkus lumus menyiapkan kira kira 20 000 bekas pelbagai jenis kuih yang ditempah oleh pelanggan sempena hari raya tidak lama lagi
8119907 kilang ini beroperasi setiap hari mulai pukul 8 pagi sehingga 12 tengah malam dan pekerjanya pula dibahagikan kepada dua syif iaitu siang dan malam

8119910 menjelang ramadan dan hari raya aidilfitri saya tak menang tangan hendak menghasilkan antara 300 hingga 500 bungkus sehari
8119911 saya mula cuba membuat kerepek ini dan memberanikan diri menjualnya di sebuah kedai di sini dan mendapat sambutan
8119912 perniagaan saya ini turut mendapat sokongan jabatan pertanian yang menyumbang tiga buah mesin meleper adunan tepung yang berharga rm3 000 seunit pada tahun lalu
8119913 alhamdulillah bengkel baru ini memberi keselesaan kepada saya untuk membuat kerepek ini

8119922 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8119923 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8119924 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8119925 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8119926 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its whats happened in this stadium so many great players and great teams have come through here
8119927 any team can erect monuments the reason those monuments are up is because theyre great players thats no secret but were moving what 100 yards the only difference from where i sit their payroll will probably go up a bunch more make it harder for us
8119928 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8119929 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8119930 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8119931 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8119932 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing

8119941 is the glass half empty half full or twice the size it needs to be
8119942 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man biden who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country abortion is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
8119943 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8119944 but saddam is evil so it is good that were deposing him
8119945 holy shit were a bunch of bastards for doing this

8119955 when evil men advance against me to devour my flesh when my enemies and my foes attack me they will stumble and fall though an army besiege me my heart will not fear though war break out against me even then will i be confident

8119963 rumors of a dummy kim began circulating after the summit some of us said we should have kims voice prints analyzed but if we did that and proved the prime minister had been conferring with a double it could have destroyed the koizumi administration so we didnt proceed
8119964 the internet is not a tool for political profit dening says in a comment posted on the website
8119965 i am happy with the speed i currently have but the more i get the better it is he says
8119966 my progress has been a lot slower than is possible he says
8119967 for example i could be selling digital downloads right now using reverbnation as the storage and provider
8119968 most merciful god we confess that we have sinned against you in thought word and deed by what we have done and by what we have left undone we have not loved you with our whole heart we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves
8119969 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
8119970 we might easily think that hitlers genocidal ambitions were rooted entirely in his virulent anti semitism but mein kampf helps to reveal that they were merely one malevolent effect of a far deeper more profound and pervasive evil a
8119971 given the epic scale of their inhumanity we need to remember that the nazi regime did not purport to do evil it claimed to be scientific and progressive to do what hard reason demanded for the ultimate benefit of the human race the superhuman acts of inhumanity were carried out for the sake of humanity
8119972 one cannot help but be reminded of darwins descent of man national socialism is nothing but applied biology said the deputy party leader of the nazis rudolf hess
8119973 hey players heres more quests its more of the same but you just have to spend more time to complete these because they require that you be level 70

8119976 we are here to bury anwars political career we are here to make history to ensure our nations future is free and safe from him
8119977 maybe khairy wants to look at his salvation act and see how he has buried his own political career with the demise of the five states in the hands of pakatan rakyat not to mention his own burial with a limbo rock on his position as deputy head of umno youth good khairy do more salvation work bury your own career
8119978 a lot of us get kind of flustered because were able to do a lot better skills during the football season than basketball
8119979 it says there were 95 000 cheerleaders in high school
8119980 there are 20 000 high schools so clearly thats a low number i think its closer to 350 000 to even 500 000
8119981 the biggest safety concern is making sure the athletes arent performing skills theyre not ready to perform
8119982 thats the no 1 reason for injuries someone attempting a skill that theyre not ready to attempt
8119983 i would say that most cheer coaches have a minimal amount of training
8119984 many of the people who are cheerleading coaches really dont even understand what coaching is all about
8119985 i think that the rules that have been put in place for college cheerleading its enough
8119986 its really restricted the college level i really think that were going to start losing college cheerleaders because theyre going to want to do some more difficult stunts
8119987 every moment of this video is a wtf moment thats why its so good
