6810000 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6810001 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6810002 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6810003 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6810004 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6810005 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6810006 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6810007 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6810008 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6810009 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6810010 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6810011 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6810012 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6810013 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6810014 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6810015 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6810016 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6810017 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6810018 we are happy to have such an easy to use and solid performing duplicator in our line up
6810019 the last five years have relieved me of any illusions about the russian judicial system
6810020 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6810021 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6810022 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6810023 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6810024 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6810025 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6810026 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6810027 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6810028 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6810029 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6810030 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6810031 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6810032 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6810033 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6810034 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6810035 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6810036 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6810037 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6810038 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6810039 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6810040 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics

6810057 all the hype coming into the olympics just put more pressure on us
6810058 we had to go out there and put on a good show hopefully in london in 2012 we can put on an even better show
6810059 i guess they say you learn the hard way and today ive learned the hard way
6810060 i put abolsutely everything into this everything from the age of ten but im an athlete ill come back stronger in london and show everyone what im made of
6810061 i was in semi retirement and quite enjoying it when the announcement was made about bmx coming into the olympics
6810062 then all my friends and family started harassing me telling me i had to have a go that i couldnt let such an opportunity pass me by
6810063 once they managed to convince me that was it i was committed 1 000 percent
6810064 in france the federation has invested a lot in bmx but we dont have the means to build replica courses
6810065 and i wanted to learn about this course during the training rides and during the competition
6810066 the chinese knew what the sport was they knew how rad radical it was and they put on a great show
6810067 i cant ask for anything more of the chinese hopefully they dug our sport
6810068 a lot of people were entertained so i guess its mission accomplished

6810077 the threat of a depressed student disgruntled employee or terrorist is real
6810078 ive coached a lot of wonderful players but i dont know if ive coached anyone tougher than him his mental toughness to absorb what he does and play like he does week in and week out year after year
6810079 hes just one of those blokes who puts himself in the right spot every time hes just an incredible bloke to play with
6810080 all our top players were back a guy said to me recently if youre going to have a bet in the finals see which team has the smallest injury list and its a pretty good tip
6810081 weve had four players missing in our last two games and that hurt us and tonight theyre all back and look at the difference look at the gold coast theyre obviously not going to make the play offs now but they were missing luke bailey and prince broken arm for long periods of time and their season went out the back door
6810082 what can you say we sit up there and watch all the heartache but they are the ones who go through all the pain
6810083 i wont run on a national ticket in 08 on live tv no further comment necessary for this lie

6810086 so the kennedys decided were going to do an air lift
6810087 in reality barack obama sr was awarded a sponsored scholarship in economics to the university of hawaii at manoa he was not part of an airlift
6810088 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation

6810295 art has its right and not only the right but the duty to subject everything else to its essence it feeds upon the story then assimilates it slowly cunningly and turns it into legend
6810296 while writing this legend which is truer than truth itself i was overwhelmed by love reverence and admiration for francis the hero and great martyr
6810297 everywhere about me as i write i sensed the saints invisible presence because for me saint francis is the model of the dutiful man the man who by means of ceaseless supremely cruel struggle succeeds in fulfilling our highest obligation something higher even than morality or truth or beauty the obligation to transubstantiate the matter which god entrusted to us and turn it into spirit

6810328 there hasnt been a study before into pre menopausal women
6810329 there are a number of theories to explain this reduction in risk including the effect of exercise on reducing a womans exposure to estrogen which is known to play a role in the development of breast cancer

6810382 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
6810383 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
6810384 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
6810385 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
6810386 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
6810387 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties

6810391 after my 17th wedding as a bridesmaid and many baby showers later i became the godmother or surrogate aunt to many little girls as we played barbies and cinderella together they would tell me that the princess had to find the prince in order to live happily ever after

6810393 true happiness is found by loving god being kind to others and being comfortable with who you are already happy princesses are people who enjoy others and like themselves
6810394 ive had countless women all over the nation tell me they wish there had been a book like this when they were little now they know that being single doesnt mean they are alone
6810395 we are not anti prince we are anti damsel in distress
6810396 true happiness comes from within and is to be shared we cant make someone else responsible for our happiness
6810397 we thought the message of this book was important and it needed to be out there in the universe
6810398 some 51 percent of adult women in our country are single so i thought the timing of the book was right

6810408 i also didnt want to see this happen i thought of soldiering on but if i did that my tendon might have been permanently damaged i really could not do it at the moment i couldnt even put my feeling into words
6810409 i know i have the potential if only i let my injury recover i wont explain more i believe i will get better the main task for me at the moment is to get treatment for my injury there are other opportunities next year and years after that i must think positively i will not blame the circumstances and i do not give up easily i will pull myself together that is who i am
6810410 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
6810411 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more

6810414 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
6810415 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
6810416 and will encourage him to come back to the track
6810417 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
6810418 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
6810419 we are united to fight india until we get freedom
6810420 we are a separate people we were never part of india
6810421 the indian army has unleashed a reign of terror in kashmir
6810422 the peace process between india and pakistan failed to change the ground situation in kashmir
6810423 now this festering wound is manifesting itself on the streets this is a mass uprising and in many ways more serious and comprehensive than the early 1990s

6810425 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
6810426 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6810427 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

6810429 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on

6810432 stond hij daar zelf met zijn nette schoenen in de modder riep hij door de telefoon dit past cht
6810433 daar heb ik er wel een paar maanden over nagedacht ik vond eerst dat anderen het moesten doen ik had graag gezien dat pierre heijnen was gebleven hij heeft een gouden rol vertokt het is een heftig jaar geweest voor de organisatie de technische staf de raad van commissarissen met periodes van 25 uur per week naast je gewone baan h met als absoluut dieptepunt de sanering van het kantoorpersoneel en het crediteurenakkoord dat heeft veel pijn gedaan ado moest uit een diep dal komen ik heb mijn hart vastgehouden vergis je niet tot een paar weken geleden waren we dolblij dat elke dag de rekeningen konden worden betaald dat de club niet is omgevallen is aan n man te danken mark van der kallen klasse topklasse
6810434 ado den haag is jarenlang straatarm geweest daardoor moest worden gekozen voor een houtje touwtje oplossing de club financieel gezond maken is n van de belangrijke doelstellingen
6810435 ado den haag kan zich cht geen ellende met de supporters meer veroorloven dat betekent dat we een harde lijn gaan volgen de commissie stadionverboden komt in principe na elke wedstrijd bij elkaar en zal direct oordelen maar we hopen dat dat niet nodig zal zijn
6810436 het is duidelijk dat ado ook hartelijker naar de bezoekers moet zijn het moet leuk zijn in het stadion niet omdat mijn roots in friesland liggen maar heerenveen mag het voorbeeld zijn supporters zijn onze gast ze moeten zich thuisvoelen bij ons stewards zullen ook meer als gastheer moeten optreden lange wachttijden voor de ingangen moeten uit den boze zijn en hoewel de gemeente nog geen vergunning heeft afgegeven moeten de fans ook een hapje en een drankje kunnen nemen nederland moet jaloers naar ado gaan kijken
6810437 we moeten niet meer naar dat verleden kijken als we nu nog in het zuiderpark hadden gezeten dan had den haag geen betaald voetbal meer gehad kijk nu eens de doelstelling om vierduizend seizoenkaarten te verkopen is bijna gehaald en er zijn al achtduizend clubkaarten over de balie gegaan
6810438 de club heeft steeds meer aantrekkingskracht richting sponsors en de betrokkenheid vanuit de regio en dan bedoel ik bijvoorbeeld nootdorp leidschendam voorburg zoetermeer wordt ook steeds groter
6810439 den haag heeft alles internationale cultuur rijksoverheid oud en modern en kijk eens naar de natuur duinen zee en k nog eens veel groen
6810440 eigenlijk is een ondernemende cultuur het enige wat ontbreekt er zijn weinig middelgrote en kleine bedrijven ja ook ado den haag heeft daar last van
6810441 een uitdaging maar wat me n g meer motiveert zijn die gassies

6810444 im going to home for make a siesta im so tired
6810445 if you asked a vermonter how many houses they have they would have no problem answering that question
6810446 we have different teams that we can call upon when it comes to the installation side
6810447 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6810448 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6810449 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6810450 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6810451 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6810452 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6810453 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6810454 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6810455 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6810456 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6810457 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6810458 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6810459 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6810460 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6810461 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6810462 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6810463 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6810464 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6810465 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6810466 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6810467 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6810468 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6810469 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6810470 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6810471 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6810472 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6810473 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6810474 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6810475 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6810476 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6810477 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6810478 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6810479 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6810480 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6810481 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6810482 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6810483 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has

6810494 you are going 26mph on a major highway there is a law against that
6810495 but when i turned on the highway the sign said 26
6810496 that is because this is interstate 26 the 26 isnt the speed limit
6810497 if youre one of the tens of thousands of sag members who dont work enough or earn enough as an actor youre in danger of losing one of your fundamental rights as a union member theyve proudly and publicly touted their list of supporters including the names of very high profile actor producers they and their supporters have signed a petition that would end democracy in the screen actors guild and create a class system between the haves and the have nots

6810500 das ist nun mit sicherheit mein liebster short track das rennen selbst war wesentlich schwieriger als die qualifikation aber ich habe mir das beste f r das ende aufgehoben denn ich wusste ja dass es dann um die wurst gehen wird
6810501 wir hatten am ende auf der strecke das beste auto aber aufgrund der ganzen gelbphasen konnten wir nicht mehr davon profitieren
6810502 der junge vor mir ist sicher besser als ich also bin ich hinter hergefahren und habe mir genau angesehen was er macht
6810503 das ist schon sehr aufregend f r mich werde ich irgendwann einmal so gut wie kyle busch sein wahrscheinlich nicht denn der junge ist einfach der hammer aber das ist okay f r mich ich will nur sehen wie weit ich komme

6810507 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6810508 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6810509 we welcome the scrutiny and will continue ongoing improvements of the quality of care provided in the state schools
6810510 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6810511 unfortunately we couldnt accept any more kids its not something we like to do
6810512 one of the reasons that i think the programs are more popular is because of the changes we made
6810513 more families are staying in webster and participating in our camps
6810514 i would say some of our day camps are up 20 percent
6810515 we just try to save any way we can it adds up
6810516 its good exercise and why would i waste money on gas
6810517 the problem is simple muslim extremists often conflate israel and the diaspora they do this for two reasons one they are anti semites and so tend to see all jews and not merely zionists as their enemies the second is a practical one it is easy to strike at soft jewish targets outside of israel easier certainly than executing mass terror attacks against israeli targets these days and so what you have on occasion is an attack like the one directed against the jewish center in argentina in 1994 in which eighty five people were murdered
6810518 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge
6810519 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6810520 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6810521 this is the time and place to make offers and this is when we made our offer
6810522 nothing to do with the case itself and more to do with the assistant attorney general in the case
6810523 it was something that was not necessary well consider anything they have to say thats reasonable
6810524 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
6810525 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6810526 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6810527 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
6810528 i cant tell you what he wants i can tell you this theres going to be a bond motion and its going to be on monday so lets see what happens

6810533 in the past weve been asked a million times about when we were gonna put out a band dvd truthfully we never felt like it was a priority and we didnt want to release something just because the market was asking for it the karmacode tour brought us to many different places around the world for the first time and we managed to record some of those great outstanding shows where the interaction with the people was just magic this dvd is a beautiful reminder of where we have been in the past three years with all our body mind and soul
6810534 this show is so hip and thats the first time in 40 years ive said the word hip not followed by replacement
6810535 im thrilled to have a recurring role on z rock this is the first time in 20 years three single guys want to see me every week these are the cutest boys in the music industry so long as you dont look in
6810536 i seem quiet but when i get upset i talk too loudly im sort of an alarmist
6810537 chris is able to calm everybody that i upset in my outbursts
6810538 i have a very negative attitude toward business and businessmen
6810539 i wouldnt really fit in a corporate structure if chris werent there to shield me from it

6810543 the australian government needs to appoint some kind of investigation about all the children who came through this agency look at their background look into their documents
6810544 these children are going to want to find their parents the communication is being lost
6810545 the thing that got to me the most was that so much scrutiny was paid to the parents here in australia who wanted to adopt but very few checks seemed to have been done into the source of the children

6810550 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even

6810562 having grown up with comics from the 60s and early 70s much of the storytelling language i use in all my comics is heavily influenced by harvey comics the archies the marvel comics of jack kirby and gene colan and the dc comics of curt swan and kurt schaffenberger
6810563 the lead characters of my story are the hero a model and a monster which lends itself well to a mash up of all those early influences
6810564 with this sentry story i can just relax and indulge my impulse to dress all my male characters in sweater vests and bow ties
6810565 you dont have modeling or effects to please the eye as you quickly move values around the page so color choice is extremely important for mood and depth
6810566 plus when dealing with a retro story i went with the classic dr martins color palette which further limits your color selection when you only have 64 colors to work with
6810567 it makes you really appreciate the talent that went into the color guides for all those decades prior to the digital age i am thrilled to have had the opportunity to partake in something that reflects that
6810568 thankfully the age of sentry isnt my first visit into vintage lettering styles
6810569 in fact retro lettering has become one of my calling cards in comics today if a new title at marvel needs a nostalgic 60s or 70s flair the wily marvel editors offer the gig to me i can never say no to a silver age lettering revival they know my catnip
6810570 ive had a lot of practice over the years aping master craftsmen artie simek and sam rosen and im always learning more from their work classic silver age lettering is all about little details to emulate organic hand drawn lettering butting word balloons and captions to the top and sides of the panels drawing organic balloons that wrap in arcs around lines of text aligning text lines to emulate the aames lettering guides letterers used to lightly pencil in lettering guidelines things that echo how a traditional hand letterer would work in those years

6810614 while we support almost any meaningful approach to reducing greenhouse gases in montana we are profoundly disappointed by the limited number and scope of solutions proposed by the eqc
6810615 we think there were many things that the eqc could have chosen to put in the report that would have had a net reduction in carbon emissions without costing the state and would have benefitted the state economy
6810616 we question why industry and major energy producers have been given no role or obligation in addressing the climate change problem
6810617 the eqc is comprised of members of both parties and members of the public that bring their own set of values and outlooks about climate change within the last year we spent upwards of over 100 hours in discussions about the governors climate change advisory council and have systematically gone about trying to incorporate them into a legislative package
6810618 everything has required a vote to move forward and weve moved as many of those items along that we have been able to given the makeup of the council personally i am not satisfied that we have gone far enough
6810619 we appreciate that we have been given an opportunity by sen wanzenried and the eqc to comment
6810620 we would like them to take our comments seriously as they go into their next meeting if they do we should see a remarkably different eqc recommendation
6810621 and theres a growing body of evidence that shows there are many things that factor into climate change do i agree that there is climate change happening yes do i believe man is the indicator no
6810622 my fear is that in a lot of these recommendations the policy will outrun the sciences and technology
6810623 until theres more scrutiny paid to the potential unintended consequences and adverse impacts to the everyday lives of montanans these policy decisions need more discussion
6810624 the letter seems to send out a signal that theres more work to be done
6810625 the temperature is similar to panama where all the frogs came from 80 degrees during the day and 62 at night

6810630 they are somewhat esoteric markets as they are when people see things that seemingly dont have any additionality it increases skepticism
6810631 one of the reasons weve steered clear of sequestration and soil sequestration projects is precisely that some of these have questions around additionality so we dont do any of that project type
6810632 if you make the stipulations too onerous and too expensive then you might not get anyone to come and play in your market
6810633 have to think hard and fast about the trade offs in sacrificing quality in the name of trading volumes
6810634 creating higher image quality even faster that requires smart anti aliasing algorithms a level of detail mechanism without switching artifacts particle systems that also work in reflections a fast soft shadowing algorithm adoption to upcoming hardware architectures we have some topics to keep us busy
6810635 targeting future architectures that consists out of tens hundreds and even thousands of cores
6810636 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6810637 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6810638 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6810639 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
6810640 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6810641 theyre not really happy times for me but its still all right
6810642 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6810643 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me
6810644 if i cant make the starting line up at blackburn then im wasting time
6810645 the manager has made his intentions clear he doesnt want me to go he wants me to stay and from my point of view i respect the manager
6810646 i cant have any complaints jason was awesome at everton and i cant see the reason why he should be taken out of the starting line up and obviously roques fantastic as well scoring goals
6810647 those two deserve to play but if i cant get in the team then yes i would want the move to sunderland
6810648 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6810649 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6810650 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6810651 wir werden saakaschwili nicht um erlaubnis fragen er selbst hat diese situation durch seine aggressiven handlungen herbeigef hrt
6810652 diese aktionen dienen nicht ernsthaft der stabilisierung der lage in der region
6810653 according to the current who guidelines none of the 244 cases reported received both adequate and sufficient post exposure treatment
6810654 the ministry of health has paid attention to this problem and released a guideline and our centre has drafted operation details to be distributed among hospital medical workers who are being trained in this measure
6810655 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
6810656 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
6810657 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
6810658 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
6810659 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
6810660 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
6810661 if thats what depression is i think i hit it
6810662 i wanted to give up why show up somewhere where 20 plus people hate you
6810663 its somewhat their culture i guess to rub peoples noses in it
6810664 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6810665 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6810666 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6810667 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6810668 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6810669 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6810670 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6810671 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6810672 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
6810673 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
6810674 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
6810675 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
6810676 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
6810677 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
6810678 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
6810679 the influence of fashion interior design and art is becoming increasingly apparent in the decorating sector too and one cant imagine a decorating sector without it we have distilled the key themes each of which corresponds to a different ambiance from these influences they all combine modernity with a playful slant
6810680 this technology makes it easy to listen to music from a compatible ipod without carrying it from room to room

6810682 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore

6810685 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6810686 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6810687 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients
6810688 however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
6810689 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
6810690 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and may require a broad societal campaign nevertheless it may be possible to address this problem without directly addressing age bias a focus on retraining the providers about triage protocols may be sufficient
6810691 additionally it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias
6810692 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6810693 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6810694 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6810695 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6810696 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

6810746 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6810747 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6810748 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6810749 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6810750 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic

6810776 in designing this pico projector with the use of led illumination and the chip along with other components weve engineered it to last longer
6810777 you want to use the cell phone so you dont want it to take up all its power using the projector
6810778 so by designing it to last at least an hour and a half it allows our customers to manufacture a very useable device
6810779 we texas instruments have created systems that are so low powered they can sample sensors and transmit information wireless without the need of a battery and they will last forever
6810780 wouldnt it be great to have a smoke alarm where you never change the batteries and it wasnt plugged into the mains
6810781 it would be wherever you wanted to put it and if you scavenge energy correctly that smoke alarm can actually talk to other alarms
6810782 so when one goes off and your bedroom doors closed the one in your bedroom can also go off

6810790 he started stamping his feet and shaking his fists saying what do you mean no arent your uptight puritanical sensibilities offended dont you want to censor me so you dont have to confront the ugly truth i represent so i say well not particularly then after a long pause he says well screw you jerk and walks off sulking
6810791 i knew who he was but i was kind of busy and didnt really have time to chat
6810792 he just kept standing there staring at me expecting me to react in some way
6810793 i tried to be nice and humor him a little i said yesiree that sure is some shocking satanic imagery no doubt about it and that one eye with no color in the pupil very disturbing id sure like to suppress that i mean what do you say to marilyn manson
6810794 manson was standing at my front door wearing those fake breasts he wore on the cover of mechanical animals
6810795 he said my name is marilyn manson and im here to tear your little world apart i thought he was collecting for the kiwanis food drive so i gave him some cans of pumpkin pie filling
6810796 i just stood there thinking now theres a boy who tries way too hard
6810797 i mean come on homoerotic sacrilege went out in the late 90s
6810798 i could have given him a citation but i figured how much harm is he really causing
6810799 i mean hes just marilyn manson for the love of mike

6810814 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6810815 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6810816 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6810817 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6810818 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then

6810823 quite honestly with what we went through last year and our coach quitting toward the end of the season the unrest with the team there wasnt a lot of hope early
6810824 but once we hired coach smith and thomas it started to build a little bit
6810825 in normal situations youre not starting with such a clean slate
6810826 we accept what the program was coming off and what atlanta was dealing with that makes it more important it makes you do more research
6810827 but yet i think these fans when theres a great product out on the field they come and they support the falcons
6810828 that dome is packed theyre screaming at the top of their lungs 70 000 plus inside the georgia dome theres not a better atmosphere in the nfl
6810829 the matter is under investigation because of the suspicions weve got the action was taken to make sure nothing developed until the info we have is proven or disproven weve got no conclusive proof
6810830 we know that the scoring system needs reform and aiba are committed to making these reforms over the next year or two
6810831 i can only f k you in a couple positions but dont worry it will be great
6810832 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6810833 the matter is under investigation because of the suspicions weve got the action was taken to make sure nothing developed until the info we have is proven or disproven weve got no conclusive proof
6810834 we know that the scoring system needs reform and aiba are committed to making these reforms over the next year or two
6810835 i wish i could have done better but all and all it was a great opportunity for me to compete against the best athletes in the world
6810836 i was supposed to be at grad school and i got the call that i was coming here so i didnt get the chance to send in the application i dont know if theyll still let me in hopefully it will work out when i get back
6810837 honestly i thought i was going to feel better today
6810838 unfortunately i didnt feel as good as i wanted to a lot of things from throughout the season added to it and the way the meet is run here you have three events in the morning and then two at night it makes for a 12 to 14 hour day and five hours sleep i was up at five and wont get to bed until midnight
6810839 youre never satisfied you always want to be better but like i said im thankful for the opportunity thankful i finished i want to go back next year and try to build on it
6810840 being in the olympics has been great i know what a value and honor it is
6810841 i am thankful for everyone who supported me for everyone back in knoxville

6810883 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6810905 sorry son but i have some bad news the donkey is on my truck but unfortunately hes dead
6810906 of course i can you watch me i just wont bother to tell anybody that hes dead
6810907 i raffled him off sold 500 tickets at two pounds a piece and made a huge fat profit
6810908 didnt anyone complain that you had stolen their money because you had lied about the donkey being dead
6810909 the only guy who found out about the donkey being dead was the raffle winner when he came to claim his prize so i gave him his 2 raffle ticket back plus an extra 200 which as you know is double the going rate for a donkey so he thought that i was a great guy

6810915 and what i learn today may be useful to me two years from now i mean if i understand the tar sands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen ive got that filed away and i can use it at some later date
6810916 because you could be the worlds greatest mining engineer but if you were wrong about the price of oil in a big way it would negate all that knowledge
6810917 so i can tell you that if you had 120 oil from now till you know 50 years from now that the tar sands would work out very well but i dont know the answer to that

6810921 the chief guardian against a free fall of the dollar is paul a volcker chairman of the federal reserve board
6810922 that situation mr volcker said cannot last it is not sustainable economically to pile up foreign debts while failing to make the investments needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debts it is not sustainable politically as pressures on the american industrial base are transmuted into demands for protection and it is not sustainable internationally as the confidence that underlies the flow of foreign savings will be eroded
6810923 sooner or later mr volcker said the process will stop the only question is how

6810928 the next bubble appeared candidates for the upcoming us presidential election were not talking about the economy or alternative energy or infrastructure now they talk about little else
6810929 next bubble development proceeds according to the inexorable logic of the us political economy two examples make the point
6810930 clean energy tax stimulus act of 2008 to the uninitiated the add on is incongruous why include energy related tax subsidies in a bill to rescue home owners and mortgage lenders what does alternative energy have to do with home foreclosures and failing mortgage companies
6810931 the next bubble understood the implications immediately us congress is eager to get a new boom going before the collapse of the previous one pulls the us economy likely already in recession into an uncontrollable tailspin

6810980 a thorough study of the market is necessary before making a purchase
6810981 the information that is available simply lacks accuracy and transparency
6810982 property prices are reflective of what a willing buyer is prepared to pay a seller if premiums are capped it affects the entire market and it is manipulative
6810983 it is a happy story so far but one never knows just how bad that inevitable fall will be
6810984 i wouldnt want to belong to any club that would have me as a member
6810985 yet too many companies have betrayed customers trust by rewarding disloyalty
6810986 for example new customers get the best mobile phone deals while long time customers pay top rates infrequent travelers get the lower advance ticket price while frequent business travelers pay ridiculously higher fares but that doesnt mean customers wont give their trust and their business to a company that really earns that trust
6810987 most businesses are started because you have a great idea and you take it out to the public to see if they like it this is the opposite were finding out what people want and doing it
6810988 stung by the impact of higher prices for food gas and health care
6810989 he is going to demand that you move out of your comfort zones and that you engage
6810990 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6810991 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6810992 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6810993 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6810994 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6810995 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6810996 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6810997 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6810998 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6810999 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6811000 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6811001 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6811002 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6811003 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6811004 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6811005 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6811006 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6811007 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6811008 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6811009 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6811010 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6811011 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6811012 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6811013 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6811014 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6811015 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6811016 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6811017 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6811018 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6811019 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6811020 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6811021 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6811022 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6811023 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6811024 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6811025 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6811026 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6811027 there are no proper online multiplayer development libraries in place
6811028 we actually ended up writing our own no trickery just a lot of coding and a somewhat excessive caffeine habit
6811029 im not sure why apple and ea havent rolled out there own online multiplayer capabilities
6811030 but i would guess because of the infrastructure requirements servers hosting bandwidth and complexity
6811031 trotz der staubigen strecke sind wir mit der abstimmung heute morgen gut voran gekommen
6811032 wir wurden mit jedem run schneller und mussten dazu nicht viel verstellen hatten also eine gute basis f r das zweite training am nachmittag herrschte immer viel verkehr auf der strecke so dass wir unsere weiteren ver nderungen nicht endg ltig berpr fen konnten doch wir sind gut in form und ich freue mich auf morgen
6811033 ich fand auf anhieb eine gute balance f r die front und verbesserte auch das heck noch im ersten training
6811034 doch die strecke war heute morgen noch gr n wie wir sagen hatte also wenig grip da bringen gr ere ver nderungen am auto nicht viel am nachmittag erreichten wir mehr und am ende war ich mit der balance sehr zufrieden nach unseren heutigen fortschritten bin ich optimistisch
6811035 eine neue rennstrecke ist immer eine interessante aufgabe f r die ingenieure da macht valencia keine ausnahme
6811036 unser heutiges training verlief sehr produktiv wir konzentrierten uns auf die auswahl der reifenmischung und fuhren mit entsprechenden spritmengen lewis und heikki zeigten eine fehlerlose leistung und wir sammelten eine menge daten die wir heute abend analysieren werden
6811037 eine erstklassige leistung der organisatoren und ganz besonders von bernie ecclestone machen diese premiere m glich die formel 1 hat so eine neue gro artige rennstrecke
6811038 f r lewis heikki und unser team war heute ein guter auftakt mit schnellen und konstanten rundenzeiten im renntrimm
6811039 wir haben uns von den mauern ferngehalten was hier am ersten tag die wichtigste regel ist man sollte auf einer neuen strecke definitiv keine wertvolle zeit verlieren weil das auto repariert werden muss w hrend die konkurrenz f r qualifying und rennen erfahrung sammelt

6811046 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6811047 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6811048 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6811049 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6811050 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6811051 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6811052 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6811053 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6811054 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice

6811060 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6811061 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6811062 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice
6811063 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6811064 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before english justice for the first time to make these points
6811065 unfortunately the court didnt agree with my submission that it should hear me on the issue about the unfairness of how he has been treated by the vietnamese system
6811066 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
6811067 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6811068 there may be another opportunity in the future its too early to tell
6811069 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6811070 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
6811071 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6811072 that was the reason for this morning when i opposed the making of a notification order
6811073 i sought an interim order to give me an opportunity to develop what im saying to you but that was not given to me
6811074 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6811075 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6811076 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6811077 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6811078 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6811079 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6811080 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6811081 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6811082 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6811083 slow pose be your back up singer introduce herself dance with you and even blow kisses
6811084 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
6811085 we can confirm that both claims are valid in some of our products once we have completed testing and analysis of the alleged issues we will communicate the next steps we will also investigate potential measures to counter the risk of stealth installation

6811090 o gilberto carvalho n o grampeador ele grampeado no momento n o vejo motivos para sua convoca o pode ser mais adiante mas agora temos outras prioridades
6811091 eu acho que a cpi n o tem mesmo a ver com a opera o satiagraha mas aquilo que na opera o contribuiu para o objeto do grampo tem que ser aproveitado ouvimos o daniel dantas o delegado prot genes queiroz e o juiz fausto de sanctis depois disso tudo dizer que a opera o n o tem liga o com a cpi deixar a porta arrombada
6811092 we welcome the scrutiny and will continue ongoing improvements of the quality of care provided in the state schools
6811093 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
6811094 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6811095 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6811096 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6811097 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6811098 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6811099 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6811100 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6811101 not only can the remotely located patient consult a specialist
6811102 the specialist too can instruct the patient for specific test procedures and treatment
6811103 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6811104 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6811105 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6811106 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6811107 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6811108 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world

6811111 distracted driving is coming up as a larger and larger issue with teens especially with the explosion of technical devices from cell phones to dvds in the car to gps systems

6811118 might for example permit the fbi to conduct long term physical surveillance of an innocent american citizen interview such an individuals neighbors and professional colleagues including based on a pretext or misrepresentation recruit human sources to provide information on that individual or conduct commercial database searches on that individual all without any basis for suspicion

6811127 future hspa releases are expected to support downlink peak rates of between 42 and 84mbits s and uplink peak rates of 23mbits s

6811135 you think it is the job of the preacher because you have a terrible misunderstanding of the role of the preacher evangelist pastor
6811136 our culture tells us a great deal about the minister and much of what it says is inaccurate it has presented an image of how he should look what his job is how he is to act what he is supposed to in times of illness and death upon whom he is supposed to call and how often and for what occasions and even what his family should be like the ministry that vocation in which one is overwhelmed with meetings and a myriad of tasks torn by conflicting expectations molded by centuries old traditions of the pastor priest seems impossible to increasing numbers of candidates who sincerely yearn to serve god

6811173 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6811174 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6811175 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

6811194 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

6811226 this is not change for changes sake but a win for common sense
6811227 we are more than willing for the west coast to come into braddon

6811229 heres an intriguing thought the john mccain barack obama fight isnt this seasons biggest political story that honor should be reserved for the intense democratic push to win a filibuster proof senate majority democrats know this is a huge prize and they are throwing at least as much money and sweat into that effort as they are into electing mr obama we had earlier in march and in may written about the priority of preventing this national committee for a conservative congress led by one or several prominent unifying conservative figures like governor romney to act now to raise money and to recruit and to back conservative candidates and incumbents in both u s senate and house races

6811253 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6811254 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6811255 by the time it gets to the hitting area it is down below the zone and diving i can see why this guy has 19 wins
6811256 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting and playing defense behind me like they are
6811257 ive been pretty much able to pound the zone low and get a lot of groundballs and strikeouts when i need it thats what ive been doing
6811258 we feel if we get a couple of runs hes webb going to be lights out
6811259 we laid our trap and we had our officers there at the airport and when this box came

6811261 there is an underground business which is being done with this type of species of animals

6811271 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6811272 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6811273 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6811274 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6811275 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6811276 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6811277 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6811278 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6811279 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6811280 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6811281 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6811282 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6811283 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6811284 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6811285 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6811286 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6811287 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6811288 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6811289 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6811290 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6811291 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6811292 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6811293 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach

6811544 everyone can also rest easy that despite their popularity mickey mouse and michael phelps are not on the short list at this time
6811545 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6811546 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6811547 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6811548 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6811549 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6811550 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6811551 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6811552 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6811553 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6811554 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6811555 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6811556 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6811557 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6811558 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6811559 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6811560 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6811561 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6811562 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6811563 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6811564 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6811565 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6811566 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6811567 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6811568 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6811569 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a to where he stood
6811570 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6811571 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6811572 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6811573 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6811574 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6811575 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6811576 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6811577 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6811578 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6811579 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6811580 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6811581 do you have any problem with that kind of schedule
6811582 my boys need to be treated the same as everyone else whether im white im black im red it doesnt matter theyre wrights sons here theyre band members
6811583 we have a housing waiting list of over 200 people who are struggling off the reserve with children who require housing

6811599 it is a taboo to bathe shower or wash your hair on the first day of the chinese new year
6811600 the chinese believe that it is rude to go empty handed when visiting a friend
6811601 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6811602 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6811629 this is not a poll saying obama has a lock on minnesota far from it
6811630 so this race is very much up in the air and up for play
6811631 this is not a poll saying obama has a lock on minnesota far from it
6811632 we were quite impressed by the impact that gov pawlenty has on mccains chances
6811633 our analysis suggests that the mccain ticket jumps by 13 points by adding gov pawlenty to the ticket that is quite an impact
6811634 i would hope that some of his ideas would be fresh
6811635 add because im a senior i hope some of my needs and concerns are his needs and concerns
6811636 he doesnt get carried away with things hes calm and his values are pretty much what i would call my own at the present time
6811637 obviously barack obama was not on stage and mccain had it all to himself
6811638 so you want to ask was that poll reflective of the general state of play in minnesota because for the most part polling over the three months before barack obama went on vacation showed the race as a double digit obama lead

6811678 i will tell you that one of the first orders of business is to secure the area we werent in lockdown that long but the area was probably secured for id say about two and a half hours or more
6811679 all high schools were in lockdown but the elementary and middle schools were not affected
6811680 i was watching the news and when it said all of the schools as part of their procedure do automatic lockdown that wasnt in keeping with what i thought we usually get our directives direct from in this case it would have been assistant superintendent roy mullins usually to our security office so i called our security office and determined that that lockdown was focused on a few schools we didnt get that directive we just go into a standby mode kind of an alert as a principal i could have locked us down but in some cases that causes more issues than if you wait and see how relevant it is to your situation
6811681 obviously the concern is always there that something like this would happen and it scares me to death just thinking about it
6811682 it was an unbelievably avoidable tragic it just makes me sick
6811683 but we will come together to try to see what we can do for the central community and certainly our thoughts and our prayers go out to that community

6811756 the reality is that we cant make emotional decisions on any player jack certainly has proven his worth again defensively and we can see that the whole club solidified with him out there but we always need to leave ourselves the ability to make the team better jack hopefully will be a big part of this turnaround going forward but as it was with jason and xavier and damaso marte if the right baseball trade is out there well have to entertain it
6811757 estimates vary in the united states but i put housings contraction effect at about 0 7 1 0 of gdp in the u s and perhaps a little lower in the u k
6811758 home equity loans were not as common during the housing boom as in the u s and thats why i dont think the slump will hurt as much here as in the u s but were still seeing at least two quarters of negative growth which will slow regional growth as well
6811759 inflation is not the major concern and it cannot be after this report
6811760 the report indicates credit availability is getting worse and consumers are pulling back spending business investment is also sagging so even though we do have a bit of a run rise with inflation the greater risk is a recession so interest rates should be cut
6811761 no question a global slowdown is underway which is all the more reason the bank of england will cut rates we need all major economy engines revving to get the free worlds economy growing at an adequate rate again
6811762 i admit im slightly amused that youre working with the

6811764 the clear tv press marking on both fadel shanas blue flak jacket and the reuter mitsubishi truck nearby
6811765 could confirm or deny that amnesty wrote its press release without having access to the full report the israeli army made on the incident
6811766 whether the basis for the underlying press release by amnesty was a specific critique of the israeli report on the incident or was part of a general critique of israel for not conducting independent investigations of civilian deaths in gaza
6811767 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
6811768 last year is probably the best the leagues ever been i think the pac 10 is going to be very competitive this year with a lot of parity
6811769 those two big guys for sure have to contribute because were short handed in terms of numbers of bodies inside
6811770 will we have seven of the top 21 picks in this years draft probably not but were going to have a lot of really good players again
6811771 not once but twice that hes not refighting the clinton obama primary because thats how looking at the actual record of events is consistently framed
6811772 right now is not the time to be thinking about anything like that
6811773 i had a chance to digest everything that happened in that situation in the offseason and right now i am strictly ready for something like this

6811780 if losing weight is your only goal why not eat whatever you want and then just go to the bathroom and stick your fingers down your throat
6811781 some trainers and weight loss experts automatically equate weight with laziness theres a real puritan streak making itself known here fat lazy bad exercise penance redemption
6811782 it takes far too much activity to burn up enough calories for a significant weight loss
6811783 recent reports from the usda have advocated ever more physical activity for adults now up to ninety minutes a day of moderate intensity exercise they have done so precisely because the evidence in support of the weight loss exercise link hypothesis is so unimpressive

6811785 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6811786 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6811787 from the beginning of my life my brother was always not just a companion but also a trustworthy guide
6811788 we have arrived at the last stage of our lives old age
6811789 the days left to live progressively decrease but in this stage as well my brother helps me to accept with serenity humility and courage the weight of each day i thank him
6811790 alongside your beloved brother during the summer season fills us with tenderness and at the same time pride

6811807 i have a friend who is an outstanding economist who thinks that the asian current account surpluses will shrink in 2009 by about 50 from their peak in 2007 in this scenario globally liquidity would become extremely tight and would have a devastating impact on asset markets including real estate commodities non aaa bonds and equities such a decline in the asian current account surpluses would cut the u s current account deficit by half and lead to a very strong u s dollar
6811808 if these processes ongoing land negotiations with government fail you are going to see a lot of political activity a manifestation of the frustrations in many native communities
6811809 oh canada too many children in poverty for too long
6811810 it is likely there will be tense confrontations between aboriginal communities and the state
6811811 there are some comparisons between canada and china tibet we are looking at two disadvantaged groups being dominated by the major larger group
6811812 the difference in canada is that aboriginal communities were all but wiped out it was truly an act of genocide
6811813 we stand in solidarity with all those fighting the destruction caused by the 2010 olympic games
6811814 financial assistance from the chinese government has poured into tibet but the reality is that tibetans have been disadvantaged and so called development has brought a mixture of feelings most people get better living standards but they are concerned about their status and religious freedom
6811815 the natural ecological balance will be disrupted and animal habitat will be lost as a result of huge increases in population and urban infrastructure
6811816 this will make it nearly impossible for people to use their lands for hunting fishing and ceremonial purposes
6811817 a good opportunity to realise that our aboriginal policies need a better understanding and a better means of helping that entire group who is really lagging behind

6811823 keybank executives and attorneys are quite excited about the program they are committed to giving our students a meaningful and substantive summer employment experience and hope to see this program in the future

6811825 thats the way to put a municipality in position to withstand the unfortunate downturn of the economy and losses of revenues

6811828 the new devices which have an improved thermal resistance are offered alongside our established lower current rated devices as a higher performance option
6811829 the increased current rating allows for the design of more compact systems where an operational current rating would have required a larger package device to have been used thereby reducing material usage weight and system cost
6811830 based on the discussions held at our joint workshop with the national renewable energy laboratory on power engineering needs for the wind industry this spring there are a number of steps that organizations can take to help strengthen the workforce in this area and support of students in their education is a critical one
6811831 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6811832 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6811833 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6811834 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6811835 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6811836 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
6811837 rapid growth of iberdrola renewables and the wind industry in general increases the need for a skilled safety conscious workforce
6811838 columbia gorge community college is the ideal institution to help us achieve our goals given the quality of its wind technician training program and the schools location near our existing and future wind plants
6811839 acquiring more clean wind power is a key part of pg amp es commitment to providing our california customers with reliable environmentally responsible energy
6811840 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
6811841 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
6811842 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
6811843 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
6811844 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
6811845 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
6811846 so many results depend on the process a person uses
6811847 to have only one way to grow a biofilm isnt going to cut it
6811848 our new strategic plan envisions significant improvements in education and research
6811849 as we enhance our actual academic quality the universitys reputation will advance as well i look forward to both developments

6811854 barangsiapa yang alloh sesatkan maka baginya tak ada orang yang akan memberi petunjuk dan alloh membiarkan mereka terombang ambing dalam kesesatan
6811855 dan barangsiapa yang ditunjuki alloh dialah yang mendapat petunjuk dan barangsiapa yang dia sesatkan maka sekali kali kamu tidak akan mendapat penolong penolong bagi mereka selain dari dia dan kami akan mengumpulkan mereka pada hari kiamat diseret atas muka mereka dalam keadaan buta bisu dan pekak tempat kediaman mereka adalah neraka jahannam tiap tiap kali nyala api jahannam itu akan padam kami tambah lagi bagi mereka nyalanya
6811856 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
6811857 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals

6811861 i relive it every time i see the man on tv

6811865 the delegates are going through the process and we are going to let them work their will on the platform
6811866 i dont think that inflation will cross the 13 per cent mark we are hopeful that actual inflation will start coming down
6811867 prices of quite a number of food items have come down the international prices of maize have declined considerably
6811868 we are giving a subsidy of rs 10 per kg to below poverty line families
6811869 the problem is simple muslim extremists often conflate israel and the diaspora they do this for two reasons one they are anti semites and so tend to see all jews and not merely zionists as their enemies the second is a practical one it is easy to strike at soft jewish targets outside of israel easier certainly than executing mass terror attacks against israeli targets these days and so what you have on occasion is an attack like the one directed against the jewish center in argentina in 1994 in which eighty five people were murdered

6811874 yesterday i played both matches the first against napoli on the right the second against juve on the left
6811875 altogether i think it went well perhaps against the bianconeri i was a bit tired because i hadnt played for 90 minutes since the match at cremona but i think it was a positive test
6811876 i continue to work calmly knowing that i will get my chances now we think about gijon then the league we want to start in the best way and we have the right motivation to do well and to face an important season like the one ahead
6811877 i see the group doing well the condition is good and it will improve from now until next sunday we will be ready for the first league match against bologna
6811878 although xslt is based on functional programming ideas it is not as yet a full functional programming language as it lacks the ability to treat functions as a first class data type
6811879 there is a new trainer and it is normal for a trainer to want to impose his philosophy and style of play
6811880 but did he surprise me not much those of us who are from here knew him as a player and a person and knew that he likes to win that he knows the club well and that he wants bar a to play attractive and sometimes effective football it has come as no surprise to me
6811881 one of the things the manager wants is for the goalkeepers to play a bit more like sweepers behind the defence that means we have to concentrate for the full 90 minutes more than before because at any moment you might have to make a run of several meters out of the area this involves a certain risk but i think it will work well
6811882 competition means you cant afford to relax at any time
6811883 as well as the competitive spirit each player has i think competition for places is always good for the team
6811884 peps philosophy the basis of football is to have fun but it is still just a game but i always want to win whatever happens i dont care if i enjoy myself or not at this club it is winning that counts

6811897 there was an inquiry from burnley but i dont think its the right time
6811898 i was very happy at liverpool and had no desire to leave but charles roberts his agent told me i should not dismiss the opportunity outright
6811899 when charles told me what napoli were offering it made my eyes water i was to receive 1m as a signing on fee
6811900 in addition to the signing on fee napoli was willing to pay me another 1m over a three year contract it was a thursday and the italian transfer deadline was 48 hours off charles told me that if i did not sign by saturday all bets were off
6811901 as a consequence the deal collapsed i then received a call from charles to say napoli had been in touch having been unable to speak to mr smith theyd had no alternative but to look elsewhere and had signed diego maradona

6811925 hes got four kids is happily married and hes obviously not going to move his family up here for what would be only a one or two year contract
6811926 it would not be fair to ask him to live in a hotel for 12 months
6811927 im taking the decision that i will play as long as i can i will be leaving crystal palace
6811928 ive been offered a coaching role but i want to play so thats my situation what comes out of leeds i cant really control
6811929 im looking for a challenge and it has got to be the right deal with the right club with the right manager and the club has to be challenging for honours
6811930 i will then move my family to go and play some football if the right deal comes up i will look forward to that
6811931 ken bates controls his club and i do think hes right that hes got to look at youth and i cannot agree with him more and if thats the way he wants to go then fine thats not a problem

6811953 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action
6811954 while the investigation into the intrusion is ongoing our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers
6811955 an intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only
6811956 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them
6811957 last week we discovered that some fedora servers were illegally accessed the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken offline
6811958 security specialists and administrators have been working since then to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall fedora systems
6811959 based on our review to date the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and the passphrase is not stored on any of the fedora servers
6811960 the effects of the intrusion on fedora and red hat are not the same
6811961 accordingly the fedora package signing key is not connected to and is different from the one used to sign red hat enterprise linux packages

6812091 everyone has the right to freedom of speech but these actions are not acceptable for someone who is representing our university
6812092 i am terribly sorry that my actions reflected poorly on the university
6812093 however they must be judged in the unique context of college debate marked by its passion and rigorous intellectual engagement
6812094 i place high value on college debate as an exceptional learning opportunity however i had no idea that college debate had degenerated into the kind of displays that we witnessed when we watched ceda events on the internet
6812095 these are people who have completely run out of food
6812096 when were giving people a supply of food to get them over a hump canned meat has to be one of the things that is part of their meals
6812097 weve put together some interesting meal ideas for them but when you are out you are out
6812098 these families are trying to get over a crisis and to hand a family with no food on the shelves 10 cans of tuna fish to feed a family of six we are not helping its embarrassing
6812099 any shelf stable or cold canned meat products are fine
6812100 when we give out a food order we cant expect people to last on just tuna fish
6812101 but weve given out almost 4 000 worth of food this month again so we are well over double our normal food output
6812102 if anyone has any questions or concerns i can explain any of our food programs

6812115 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6812116 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
6812117 i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6812118 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6812119 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna
6812120 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6812121 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit

6812123 they took a cash box and fled in a white honda ballade no arrests have been made yet
6812124 so fast and was over in 60 seconds we are busy reviewing footage of the incident but there were no injuries reported
6812125 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6812126 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6812127 we are really recognising e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6812128 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6812129 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6812130 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6812131 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6812132 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6812133 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6812134 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6812135 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding
6812136 this adds to the widespread belief that the selective targeting of comrade jacob zuma is politically motivated
6812137 the pending charges against comrade zuma are perceived by many to pose a real threat to the political stability of the country
6812138 the union will discipline members who act outside of its code of conduct and bring the union and the profession into disrepute
6812139 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing
6812140 it feels like when were going out there its tough
6812141 every game is tough these days but we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley
6812142 we will get there we will build on that but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6812143 the manager thrives on challenges he wants the best out of the team and hell get that
6812144 people expect change straight away and it just doesnt happen like that

6812157 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner the misano circuit is quite fast but it feels tight and narrow the grip level is okay last year we used medium compound tyres because it was quite hot the track was also very bumpy last year which was probably its worst feature from a set up point of view the most important thing at misano is having good braking power and good stability when accelerating out of the corners its the kind of track that requires you to ride aggressively my favourite section is the final part though the most important section for good lap times is the first the atmosphere is great and it can get quite intense you get a lot of valentino rossi fans there because his hometown is nearby

6812175 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes nonetheless were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6812176 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress is very encouraging

6812197 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors

6812208 i dont want to be at real madrid for the rest of this season i want to move to chelsea
6812209 with all due respect to madrid its players and the bernabeu fans i must admit that my head has been turned not by the money but by the footballing project at chelsea
6812210 i want to play in the premier league and i must admit that chelseas offer to me is a very attractive one too however its not about money and ive made that clear to real madrid
6812211 its about pride following a dream and about a challenge ive set myself the goal of becoming the best player in the world and thats not going to be possible at real madrid in my opinion
6812212 ive completed a footballing cycle at real madrid after three years there two spanish titles and crucial goals scored for the club
6812213 thats why i specifically want the real madrid directors to realize that im determined to leave and why i ask them to reach an agreement with chelsea
6812214 thus far ive avoided speaking about this situation in the media to avoid causing the kind of row which dogged cristiano ronaldo all summer
6812215 but my head is already in england thats why i need the madrid directors to understand my personality
6812216 im a pro and ill train and play 100 per cent for this club but i think its better for the moment that bernd schuster does not select me for the team
6812217 ill train to the maximum and ill not refuse to play in this weekends supercup match against valencia but now the fans know that im determined to join chelsea i dont want them thinking if i have a bad game that ive done it deliberately

6812332 what if we ask them if they want to run together until we get to a certain point and then itll be every man for himself
6812333 that way we can relax a little not push as hard and not suffer as much plus it might be fun to run with them and talk

6812336 while the study once again illustrates the importance of a college education to americans it also points to areas of focus for all of us interested in higher education
6812337 for example too few parents and students are focusing on the total cost of college not enough are using available college savings tools too many are borrowing without considering how they will repay and too many are not completing federal financial aid forms that enable them to access free federal financial aid and lower cost student loans for our part sallie mae is committed to making it easier for families to navigate the financial aid system for example we counsel customers to follow a 1 2 3 approach to paying for college so that they exhaust grants and scholarships explore federal loans and fill any gap with private education loans

6812342 the amount of oil seeping from the ocean floor since 1970 equals more than 31 times the amount of oil spilled in 1969

6812358 what is required to develop the counties along the west coast of ireland both in economic and social terms
6812359 having visited the counties of the west coast this week and after meeting with approximately fifty different groups my opinion that the west is suffering a death by a thousand cuts has been reinforced
6812360 during the consultation process many of the same issues were brought up time and again in every county including the problem of access to the west and within the west the lack of broadband provision and equality of access to public services
6812361 community development projects in each county all pointed to a lack of support from government even though they are basically doing the work that the government is failing to do
6812362 it is also quite obvious that the government employment strategy prioritises gateway towns while smaller towns are neglected we need to see a new employment strategy that includes initiatives to attract jobs to our small towns if they are to survive
6812363 one of the most striking and worrying things that i have learned of is the awful neglect of our island communities off the west of ireland
6812364 this year we have aspirations to grow our number of entrants to approximately 600 700 having made a decision to proactively target the clubs and societies in the area
6812365 our walks marathons and running events constitute around 25 of the foyle hospices annual income we are delighted that seagate have once again lent their support to this event and thank them for their ongoing generosity
6812366 as seagate is one of the north wests largest private sector employers i am delighted to see that it is continuing its support of our charitys work to raise funds to help care for those living with cancer and other life limiting illnesses
6812367 its great to see seagate make a corporate donation to foyle hospice and encourage employees to get together to support the run as individuals we raise further funds through our own sponsorships to do the walk and i hope this year our participation will help break all previous records for the event
6812368 originally we anticipated 200 students participating in master the mainframe however we ended up having more than 450 students sign up for the event
6812369 this demonstrates the continued interest in mainframe computing particularly in an it environment where there is a lot of pressure to consolidate and reduce space the mainframe is a great platform in terms of scale performance and energy efficiency
6812370 i took part in this contest because it provided me with a challenge
6812371 i liked part 3 of the contest as it involved lots of different technologies and things that can be done using ibm mainframes such as issuing unix commands executing java classes etc which were totally new to me i really enjoyed it

6812378 because this young demographic is afraid that wearing a hearing aid signals old age and many cant justify paying thousands of dollars for a quality aid approximately 80 of baby boomers refuse to seek hearing treatment until its too late
6812379 this problem has reached epidemic proportions lack of sound stimulation via the ear to the brain tells the brain to stop processing sounds into words when this happens with or without hearing aid correction the result is usually permanent hearing loss

6812382 we now look forward to testing the pw1000g engine on the airbus a340 flight test aircraft
6812383 this second phase of testing which will include approximately 75 flight hours will focus on engine performance and acoustic testing while providing valuable installation and operating data

6812397 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
6812398 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
6812399 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well
6812400 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely

6812526 its encouraging to see so many nada members sign up to become green checkup dealers at such a fast pace
6812527 with high fuel prices and greenhouse gas emissions on the minds of many americans the incentive has never been greater for motorists to invest in the kind of maintenance that improves fuel economy
6812528 dealerships are located in every major community in the country which means we are ideally positioned to be at the forefront of a national consumer awareness campaign
6812529 dealers around the country have invested close to a billion dollars on facility upgrades and new construction over the past few years to reduce energy consumption at their dealerships

6812547 president dmitry medvedev said he would support any decision by their peoples but quoted the un charter which stipulates that an independent country should be recognized as such at the general assembly
6812548 his request is most likely to be declined then the next step could be to adopt a federal law regulating russias relations with abkhazia in that case abkhazia would obtain some security guarantees and economic independence
6812549 also the united states could be reminded about a similar law of its own concerning taiwan that country isnt recognized by the international community either but the u s signed a mutual defense agreement with it in 1972
6812550 similar deals would probably suit both south ossetia and abkhazia even if russia does not recognize their independence
6812551 russia has much to gain by recognizing the two republics now it would certainly be our greatest foreign political victory over the past few years however one should bear in mind that this move could severely hit the russian political elites commercial interests in the west that is why these people are lobbying against the move and the process is therefore likely to get dragged out for years
6812552 if the west keeps supporting georgian president mikheil saakashvili georgia will probably try to carry out another intervention in south ossetia its preparations for a new aggression will then make russia face the need to provide assistance and protection recognition of south ossetias independence will make it legitimate to send russian forces there
6812553 we are currently investing huge funds into the restoration of south ossetia how can we be sure the money wont be lost after georgia uses the grad launchers in yet another attack on what we have restored we need to go ahead with the recognition from a purely pragmatic standpoint even though we certainly cannot expect the two republics to become subjects of international relations right away it may take years
6812554 both companies are not inclined to pay over the odds for the asset but russia would prefer sinopec over ongc
6812555 on the whole the indian companys cooperation with russia did not turn out as expected india has not offered special preferences or interesting projects meanwhile rosneft is most interested in cooperation with china
6812556 if sinopec buys iec this will help to resolve the latters problems with environmental agencies for rosneft could make use of its administrative resource for the sake of its chinese partners
6812557 the price range offered by ongc is too low compared with our companys fair evaluation of iec at 3 4 billion sinopec can offer a higher price to the seller considering that chinese oil companies successfully compete with ongc for profitable resources in oil exporting countries

6812560 but in the next five years europe will have nothing to counter gazproms expansion with during this period gazprom must offer enough gas for sale and prove the credibility of its projects

6812567 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6812568 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6812569 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6812570 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home

6812650 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6812651 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6812652 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6812653 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6812654 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6812655 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6812656 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6812657 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6812660 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6812661 als anfang m rz in hamburg beinahe eine lufthansa maschine abgest rzt w re enth llte bild das traurige geheimnis der sch nen pilotin auf ihrer titelseite ein blick ins studivz reichte um herauszufinden was die hobbys und vorlieben was die ngste von maxi j 24 waren
6812662 das st bern nach privatdaten im studivz geh rt mittlerweile offenbar zum handwerkszeug jedes bild redakteurs
6812663 nat rlich nutzen bild redakteure wie im brigen alle anderen journalisten auch alle verf gbaren informationen im internet f r die recherche inwieweit diese informationen bestandteil eines artikels werden h ngt nat rlich ganz vom einzelfall ab
6812664 meine praktikantin wies mich darauf hin dass caroline bei studivz registriert ist
6812665 ich konnte den kontakt zu drei freundinnen von caroline herstellen mit denen ich per e mail und telefonisch korrespondierte
6812666 die letztlich alle das ziel haben die weltherrschaft an mich zu rei en
6812667 ich habe die redaktionen auf die herkunft des bildes hinge wiesen und gebe den schwarzen peter damit weiter
6812668 zu redaktionsinternen vorg ngen u ern wir uns grunds tzlich nicht zum anderen sind wir dem quellenschutz verpflichtet
6812669 gro e skepsis die uns presseleuten nach kurzer zeit aus carolines freundeskreis entgegengebracht wurde
6812670 wer kann mir etwas ber caroline erz hlen sehr dringend
6812671 ich war damals 59 jahre alt da konnte ich mich doch nicht mehr mit richtigem namen in einem studentennetz anmelden
6812672 sie sah sich selbst als k nig der unterwelt wollte diabolische pl ne schmieden und die weltherrschaft an sich rei en das zumindest schrieb die 21 j hrige studentin caroline b aus passau auf ihrer internetseite ob sie sich in eine fantasiewelt fl chtete weil sie ahnte dass ihr wirkliches leben nur kurz sein w rde
6812673 nachdem wir keine anderen informationen ber sie finden konnten mussten wir uns eben auf das verlassen was sie ber sich schreibt au erdem arbeitete ich unter immensem zeitdruck
6812674 das war die eine seite von caroline b die andere driftete ins mystische sie h rte gothic musik und las irvine walsh der auch das drehbuch f r den abgedrehten kultfilm trainspotting geschrieben hat der zur ihren lieblingsstreifen z hlte
6812675 mit dieser art der informationsbeschaffung die grenzen der geschmacklosigkeit berschritten
6812676 den beleidigenden ton ihrer zuschrift f hren wir darauf zur ck dass der gewaltsame tod einer kommilitonin sie offensichtlich nicht kalt gelassen hat ein gutes zeichen
6812677 jedes mittel nutzen um an m glichst authentische aussagen zu gelangen
6812678 die pnp hatte bei studenten schon immer ein schlechtes image
6812679 ein v llig falsches bild wurde von caroline in den berichten gezeichnet sie wurde regelrecht in den dreck gezogen
6812680 dass dieser branche absolut das mitgef hl die soziale verpflichtung verloren gegangen ist hat mich so erschreckt dass ich angewidert bin mir ist der spa am studium vergangen da man ja irgendwann f r solche gef hllosen menschen arbeiten muss
6812681 die verwendung von mitgliederfotos und informationen aus studivz und sch lervz zum zwecke der berichterstattung verletzt die urheber und pers nlichkeitsrechte unsere nutzer solange die rechte nicht an die entsprechenden medien abgetreten wurden eine derartige verwendung verbieten wir ausdr cklich in unseren allgemeinen gesch ftsbedingungen zudem empfinden wir diese art von missbrauch als respekt und geschmacklos gegen ber unseren mitgliedern der nutzer kann gegen das entsprechende medium rechtlich vorgehen was bei einem missbrauchsfall auch in unserem interesse ist
6812682 ihre gef hle ihre erlebnisse ihre freunde ihr leben gedankenlos firmen an die umfassende datens tze ber sie besitzen besser als alles was die gestapo und stasi je hatten
6812683 das internet bietet unter anderem in den gro en sozialen netzwerken viele recherchem glichkeiten f r journalisten hierbei muss jedoch immer bedacht werden dass die informationen die ein nutzer in ein solches forum einstellt dort erst einmal nur f r einen bestimmten personenkreis ver ffentlicht werden in der regel bedenkt kaum jemand dass auch journalisten das forum als quelle nutzen k nnten von daher sind von seiten der journalisten unbedingt die pers nlichkeitsrechte der nutzer zu wahren ziffer 8 des pressekodex nur weil sich jemand in einem solchen portal vorstellt hei t dies nicht dass die daten auch f r die ver ffentlichung in der presse freigegeben sind dies gilt insbesondere auch f r fotos beispielsweise von opfern oder t tern auch das thema datenschutz sollten die journalisten dabei im auge haben ein jugendlicher nutzer des internets ist diesbez glich h ufig sehr unbedarft daher obliegt dem journalisten hier auch eine spezielle sorgfaltspflicht
6812684 dass journalisten angaben ber personen in den sogenannten sozialen netzwerken f r ihre recherchen verwenden ist nicht nur legitim sondern notwendig um ein m glichst umfassendes bild einer person zu gewinnen allerdings d rfen sie sich nicht ausschlie lich der sozialen netzwerke bedienen im klartext studivz kann erste hinweise geben und m gliche kontaktpersonen nennen der direkte kontakt zwischen dem journalisten und den kontaktpersonen muss dennoch erfolgen und selbstverst ndlich m ssen journalisten die im pressekodex festgelegten medienethischen regeln beachten dazu geh rt beispielsweise dass sie nicht ohne einwilligung der angeh rigen das foto der ermordeten ver ffentlichen d rfen selbst wenn es simpel ist ber studivz an das foto zu gelangen
6812685 auch lange bevor es das internet gab stellten sich journalisten die frage wie sie mit informationen aus der privatsph re eines menschen umgehen ob sie intime details um der sensation und des kommerziellen erfolgs willen ver ffentlichen und um der eigenen eitelkeit zu schmeicheln und dabei einen rufmord in kauf nehmen oder ob sie solche informationen zur ckhalten um das ansehen eines menschen sein leben gar nicht zu zerst ren
6812686 die w rde des menschen sollte respektiert werden das sollte aber nicht einen kritischen journalismus verhindern
6812687 im too smart busy to waste my time doing that
6812688 today im very happy to meet you and to welcome you to syracuse university and suny esf for the first time welcome were thrilled that youre here this is your campus this is your city this is your world and this is your time to shine as you know youve come to a place with great traditions and history and we are proud of it this dome is full today of amazing alumni who have sat in your seats would they all stand for a cheer and faculty who will accompany you on your journey and lets cheer for them as they stand its taken many years and much effort by you and your families to arrive at this place in your lives and i know at least for your families there is both excitement and some anxiety today personally ill never forget the day i went to college many years ago i was of course nervous but my mother was so nervous she walked right into a glass door now im sure you are all a bit calmer than we were yet it is a major moment and worth some reflection on why youre here and what kind of journey youre undertaking
6812689 in a knowledge economy you are here understandably to gain a foothold on your future though probably not the one you envision today
6812690 the expression of poetry the sound of its words helps us to live our lives
6812691 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6812692 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6812693 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6812694 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6812695 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6812696 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6812697 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6812698 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6812699 ashley is now worth three times what we paid for him i am inclined to exaggerate but he is priceless he is absolutely outstanding
6812700 ive already said i was surprised he was not in the england squad for the midweek game with the czech republic but his time will come no question of that he is absolutely outstanding
6812701 actually i had better not shout out how much i think he is worth because we are in the throes of doing a new contract with him i actually think he is worth 4million his value has plummeted until we have got the contract sorted
6812702 in all seriousness i would like to try and do that contract in the next week or two are we that close yes
6812703 i still think at the time i would have preferred to have paid 5million rather than the initial 8 2million for ashley you had to take a gulp it kept going up
6812704 but he has shown his worth he relishes the free role we give him and his delivery of crosses emphasised by the one headed home by john carew for the first goal against manchester city is superb
6812705 he is a natural and we see him do that sort of thing on the training ground time and time again
6812706 it is their first home game in normal circumstances you would not want to face a promoted side in their first home game i saw them last week and i thought they were more than holding their own against bolton until the first goal
6812707 they lost a bit of concentration at that time they retrieved the second half and pulled themselves around again but regardless of that result for the first home game back in the big league after 21 years the place will be buzzing
6812708 mon is completely bonkers 18mill for barry and 30 for young psssshhhh i might be a bit bitter about not getting barry but jeez your manager has gone mad

6812710 weve known each other since high school hes my dancing partner but i have to say he is a far better dancer than me we have great fun and watching him at the olympics in the past week has made me a happy man
6812711 to become the fastest man in the world and break both records is phenomenal it is fantastic for our country and im very pleased for him i know how hard he works at his athletics and hes earned it
6812712 i would have to score the winning goal in a champions league final for stoke to make me feel as good as he does right now
6812713 its not like england where people like david beckham get swamped if they go out people in jamaica are happy to see you do well but they also give you space and keep themselves to themselves
6812714 me and usain also like to go to cricket matches and we met up with courtney walsh and curtly ambrose to watch the west indies play australia at sabina park in may west indies matches are like parties and we like to party

6812739 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6812740 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6812741 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6812742 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6812743 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6812744 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6812745 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

6812760 unlike opinion polls nclb doesnt test a sample of students it tests all students the only way states can even justify using margin of errors in the first place is with the strange assertion that the entire population of a school is a sample of some larger universe of imaginary children who could have taken the test theoretically
6812761 the fourth graders who happened to be in this school in 2000 scored higher than the particular group of students who happened to be enrolled in 1999
6812762 because the bible says nothing about dating or little about how a young man and a young woman should find a spouse we have no clear commandments on this subject

6812774 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6812775 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6812782 youre seeing us develop as a company and launch services in a very regimented way so that we address the realities of the marketplace
6812783 he understands what publishers are challenged with in terms of the business issues related to inventory management and pricing and yield optimization and thats a critical area for us
6812784 the marketplace kind of always pigeonholed us a measurement company
6812785 we believe that the definition of audience data and how its applied has to be completely rethought
6812786 i got very familiar with both sides of the operation
6812787 think about them in terms of the asset and the infrastructure that they built that base level census level database level what can you do with that asset theres a variety of different ways quantcast can take that asset and leverage it
6812788 ill be spending a fair amount of time with the teams talking through the product roadmap
6812789 another large part of my job is certainly external getting the various publishers feedback on the products
6812790 we look for talent both internally and externally to step into leadership positions but we have nothing to announce today
6812791 we dont expect to miss a beat in the execution of our core strategies
6812792 christ shall even now as always be exalted in my body whether by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain but if i am to live on in the flesh this will mean fruitful labor for me and i do not know which to choose but i am hard pressed from both directions having the desire to depart and be with christ for that is very much better yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake
6812793 truly i say to you if anyone keeps my word he shall never see death
6812794 oh death where is your victory o death where is your sting
6812795 his stuffed animal hippo had the remnants of the cartridge and orange paint on his temple there was glass on his pillow
6812796 its not as though wed have a dragnet around the entire city
6812797 we live in a kind of wealthy neighborhood why dont we kick in and help our police department
6812798 im sick and tired of the crime in our neighborhood
6812799 the one thing that frustrates us the most is when residents call and its 20 minutes later
6812800 cops love nothing more than going to a call like that and finding a crook then taking him to jail
6812801 acabar con las barreras que impiden a la gente conectarse
6812802 comecei com 7 anos de idade tem imagem minha pequena nessa arena
6812803 tem que ter dedica o treino sorte e acho que deus n

6812805 eu era mais corajosa n o tinha no o do perigo
6812806 there were a lot of offers for us to get back together
6812807 the money was tempting but we didnt do it because we felt we were honoring the memory of the band co founder and songwriting partner chris difford and i didnt talk for a few years and i thought it would feel fraudulent to reform if we werent really a proper band just to grab some cash
6812808 but were planning to do a new record it all sprung about because it feels right it feels good again
6812809 this tour is about respecting what weve done and doing it properly
6812810 when we got back together we got a chance to do something we never did before because it was just like starting again
6812811 we said ok lets go back and listen to the records and see how we did it and lets do that
6812812 what happens when youve been in a band for years and this has certainly happened to squeeze god knows how many members there have actually been every song you do gradually changes
6812813 its like the stop frame thing of a plant growing you cant see it but there on film you can see how it does how it twists and turns and branches out
6812814 were doing goodbye girl in the way we recorded it
6812815 we never did that before because drum machines werent so reliable in those days and moogs would sort of change key so we did sort of a rock and roll version of the thing now were doing it and it sounds great the surprising thing to me is that some of the earlier stuff we do now sounds more contemporary than some of the later stuff
6812816 glenn tilbrook one for the road the story of one man two guitars and an rv
6812817 its like people love us more than they ever did its like getting to see what its like if you died and then its no im not dead really here we are back again its really a lovely feeling for us

6812829 both caps and ratios of the sort the court relies upon in this discussion are typically imposed by legislatures not courts
6812830 seinfeld does represent sort of a challenge hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6812831 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6812832 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6812833 i really enjoy arguments its an opportunity to test our views against the positions taken by the advocates it also can help identify the basis for a middle ground resolution if there is a split for the justices
6812834 an oral argument is as different from a brief as a love song is from a novel it is an opportunity to go straight to the heart
6812835 its worth pointing out that this is a courtesy visit arranged by a man who though a bitter political opponent of thatcherism remembers her invitation to him as a young backbencher in 1983 to meet her when she was pm
6812836 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
6812837 estuvimos con carlos y afortunadamente su recuperaci n va evolucionando aunque todav a tiene un tubo para respirar que esperemos que durante el domingo o lunes a m s tardar se le retire y posteriormente sea traslado a terapia media afortunadamente ya tiene movimiento en sus pies y manos lo cual es una gran noticia
6812838 el apoyo que se le ha brindado es lo m nimo que podemos hacer y hasta ahorita todos los jugadores del club compa eros de otros equipos y justino compe n y decio de maria presidente y secretario general de la fmf respectivamente han estado al pendiente lo que quiere decir que ha existido un gran apoyo en general de la familia del futbol mexicano
6812839 durante estos d as tanto memo que estuvo con la selecci n nacional como caba as y vera quienes fueron a paraguay han estado llamando para preguntarnos c mo ha evolucionado carlos
6812840 failed to submit admissible evidence establishing a causal link between her injuries and decedents alleged breach of duty and t hus plaintiff failed to establish the element of causation in her cause of action for negligence
6812841 in order to defeat defendants summary judgment motion plaintiff only needed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the issue of causation she did not need to establish that
6812842 in order to give fair consideration to those who call upon us for justice we must insist that parties do not clog the system by presenting us with a slubby mass of words rather than a true brief
6812843 they have taken a phrase or two and have fashioned from them an argument that attempts to subvert the trial courts intent in order to deny support to kwongs children and interest on his obligation his former wife for a nine month period
6812844 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6812845 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6812846 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6812847 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6812848 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6812849 you know there are some things that even i dont know and what michelle is going to wear is a tightly held secret more tightly held than who my vice presidential choice is going to be
6812850 when people have challenged her in the past their nomination forms have been thrown out
6812851 that wont happen with me other people running against her did the bare minimum i never do anything at a minimum i go all the way
6812852 carolyn wade went to the membership last year and told them the contracts not the best but we have to vote for it anyway because its the best were going to get
6812853 she promised members a 12 000 bonus over four years which was clearly incorrect but people voted for this contract based on that and other promises
6812854 this new contract is representative of a new era of state workers not only being paid less than folks in private sector but trading off was job security and benefits
6812855 the local is having to foot the bill to pay for the legal defense of our local president
6812856 she should be representing herself and paying for it herself
6812857 carla katz is a microcosm of whats going on in the cwa right now
6812858 if you dont go along with whats going on with national you suffer the consequences
6812859 if carla katz had an inside track with this guy it sure as hell didnt help state workers
6812860 hes not as bad as the republicans who wanted 5 000 layoffs but its close we keep paying or everybody elses sins
6812861 me personally i would definitely support someone else besides corzine if another democrat with a better union record challenged him in a primary
6812862 but i would leave it up to membership to decide
6812863 after my 17th wedding as a bridesmaid and many baby showers later i became the godmother or surrogate aunt to many little girls as we played barbies and cinderella together they would tell me that the princess had to find the prince in order to live happily ever after
6812864 i pointed out that i have not found a prince but i have a fantastic life i wanted these girls to know they can have a fantastic life no matter what stage they are in
6812865 true happiness is found by loving god being kind to others and being comfortable with who you are already happy princesses are people who enjoy others and like themselves
6812866 ive had countless women all over the nation tell me they wish there had been a book like this when they were little now they know that being single doesnt mean they are alone
6812867 we are not anti prince we are anti damsel in distress
6812868 true happiness comes from within and is to be shared we cant make someone else responsible for our happiness
6812869 we thought the message of this book was important and it needed to be out there in the universe
6812870 some 51 percent of adult women in our country are single so i thought the timing of the book was right
6812871 the rest of the house was on fire we couldnt get out
6812872 if it wasnt for russian soldiers south ossetia would now be part of georgia
6812873 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or one day
6812874 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6812875 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica

6812878 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6812879 the legislation you enact into law may not be subject to judicial enforcement if that occurs
6812880 i believe we all agree that a functioning court system is not a luxury it is an essential component of state government there are severe limits to how much we can reduce the services that we are required to provide
6812881 y ahora todo mierda oliendo mierdas y cosas que putas
6812882 orale vos ya pod s salir y ah regresas antes de madrugada si no com s mierda
6812883 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6812884 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6812885 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6812886 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6812887 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6812888 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6812889 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6812890 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6812891 you literally could make an object of any imaginable shape or design an object of any imaginable shape and simply hit the print command and the matter would take that shape
6812892 the late arthur c clarke famed british author and inventor had this wonderful quote any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic and thats what programmable matter is its a technology so advanced it might as well be magic
6812893 and well go from millimeters to microns i guess some time over the next five to 10 years
6812894 the programming questions are even more profound people are struggling to program four cores or eight cores and when larrabee comes out several dozens of cores
6812895 how would you program a million or a billion pieces of programmable matter what does programming even mean
6812896 wouldnt it be nice sometime in the future if we can get rid of the cords you wouldnt have a battery in the sense you do now
6812897 as you move into these fields youd very quickly power up your device literally in a matter of seconds and itd be good for several hours of operation with the idea that some time in the next several hours youd find another wireless power source
6812898 theyll be built into the tables or into the walls and they will just keep you going
6812899 the point is to stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6812900 breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6812901 there is rich irony in microsoft opting for a comedian to help pitch its products but i wont go there
6812902 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6812903 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6812904 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6812905 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6812906 president obama is going to have plenty on his plate in january
6812907 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6812908 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6812909 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6812910 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6812911 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6812912 introduce the ndps official candidate for the vancouver fairview by election
6812913 the interview was all about his inspiring road to recovery
6812914 graham accepted the request of the reporter and invited the newspaper into his home to conduct the interview
6812915 the decision not to publish the article was clearly in the best interests of grahams recovery
6812916 we in the danish media must send a strong and unmistakable message to anybody getting similar mad ideas about attacking kurt westergaard

6812923 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6812924 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6812925 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6812932 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6812933 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6812934 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6812935 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6812936 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6812938 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6812939 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6812940 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears

6812973 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

6812977 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6812978 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6812979 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6812980 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

6812982 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6812983 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6812984 results suggest that trainers under time constraints could increase their training effectiveness during the early stages of training by not feeding excess dietary energy
6812985 we are united to fight india until we get freedom
6812986 we are a separate people we were never part of india
6812987 the indian army has unleashed a reign of terror in kashmir
6812988 the peace process between india and pakistan failed to change the ground situation in kashmir
6812989 now this festering wound is manifesting itself on the streets this is a mass uprising and in many ways more serious and comprehensive than the early 1990s
6812990 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6812991 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6812992 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6812993 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6812994 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6812995 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6812996 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6812997 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6812998 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6812999 he is the guest of the iranian government who will control him until such time they have comfortably wrested control of the mahdi army away from him
6813000 das alles sagt wenig ber die tats chliche bedrohungslage der jeweiligen systeme aus wie die forscher best tigen microsoft software ist f r angreifer schon auf grund des verbreitungsgrades das lohnendere ziel und nicht jede l cke wird auch f r angriffe genutzt nicht ber cksichtigt werden konnten auch all die sicherheitsl cher die nicht bekannt wurden und unter der hand gehandelt werden aber die daten belegen doch dass mac user sich oftmals einem falschen sicherheitsgef hl hingeben dementsprechend sollten apple user aber auch die in der untersuchung nicht ber cksichtigten linux anh nger die gleichen sicherheitsmassnahmen zum schutz sensibler daten umsetzen wie sie f r windows nutzer schon lange empfohlen werden
6813001 el coche cambia por completo con o sin gasolina factores decisivos como la adherencia o la estabilidad en las frenadas se modifican enormemente la confianza en los frenos ser fundamental ma ana en la clasificaci n es muy dif cil hacer una vuelta perfecta
6813002 cada vez que hemos entrado en pista hab a m s goma en el asfalto y m s grip adherencia que en la anterior
6813003 estos primeros d as de competici n en un circuito nuevo son complicados para todos la pista es buena aunque hay que encontrar los puntos clave cuanto antes hay sectores en los que hay que estar muy concentrado este no es un circuito urbano al uso sino que tiene algo m s
6813004 estamos evolucionando carrera tras carrera creo que actualmente estamos en disposici n de estar entre los seis primeros en la clasificaci n y mantenernos en los puntos en la carrera la victoria creo que es imposible pero espero que este fin de semana suponga un paso adelante para nosotros
6813005 no podemos olvidar que cuando empec a ganar carreras ninguna televisi n nacional daba en directo las carreras mientras que ahora incluso se retransmiten los test de invierno ha habido un gran cambio en todo el pa s yo estoy en medio de todo esto y estoy feliz
6813006 no creo que sea una zona conflictiva ni peligrosa porque si te mantienes a la derecha hay buen acceso al pit lane adem s los veh culos que vayan por delante de ti tienen espacio para frenar un poco m s tarde de modo que no molestan hoy he pisado la l nea y he cometido un error
6813007 one of the older children then said to the mother cassandras not in bed
6813008 she immediately realized her own infant cant go anywhere she ran to the vehicle and unfortunately the child was deceased
6813009 everyone thinks these parents are bad or strung out on drugs but parents whove lost their kids in these types of accidents include pediatricians doctors school principals lawyers and nasa engineers
6813010 for the most part these are highly educated extremely loving and doting parents
6813011 in the early 90s these cases were rare but then in the mid 90s front passenger airbags were installed in cars and there was a huge campaign to get kids to move to the back seat an unintended consequence of this was kids dying of hyperthermia in cars because children were out of sight out of mind
6813012 and in an overwhelming majority of cases there has been a change in routine
6813013 in so many cases if the daycare provider would have called tragedy could have been averted
6813014 we wont give up until its passed because it would save countless lives
6813015 en estos momentos nuestra misi n es dar un coche competitivo a fernando alonso para este a o y el que viene
6813016 en primer lugar debemos saber con certeza si es segura ya que tenemos la responsabilidad sobre el piloto estoy de acuerdo en desarrollar cualquier tipo de tecnolog a pero la nica forma de controlar el coste es la colaboraci n entre todos
6813017 de todas formas mi filosof a es que a la gente no le interesan las cajas de cambios ni las suspensiones que monta cada veh culo sino el espect culo
6813018 nunca pens que estuviese finalizado a tiempo con este resultado no es s lo un circuito urbano sino mucho m s se respira una atm sfera excepcional

6813040 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6813041 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6813042 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6813043 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6813044 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6813045 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6813046 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6813047 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6813048 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6813049 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6813050 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6813051 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6813052 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6813053 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6813054 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6813055 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6813056 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6813057 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6813058 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6813059 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6813060 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6813061 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6813062 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6813063 the final order granted the citys request for a declaratory judgment stating i the city validly exercised its authority pursuant to subchapter c of chapter 402 of the texas local government code adopting ordinance no 16668 and creating a municipal drainage utility and ii ordinance no 16668 lawfully delegated operation and management of the citys municipal drainage utility to the el paso water utilities public service board pursuant to chapter 1502 of the texas government code
6813064 the court further ordered that in the event of an appeal of this final judgment the defendants the city of el paso and public service board are entitled to an equitable and just award of attorneys fees in the amount of 25 000 00 for appeal to the 8th court of appeals and 15 000 00 for appeal to the texas supreme court
6813065 we did not believe this fee was justified in a case where a citizen brings a action like this against government if it was not frivolous no one would be able to seek good government if all was at risk
6813066 i feel he only wants the higher courts to make the decision in this most important issue this sets law and will probably go all the way to the supreme court one way or the other
6813067 thought it the lawsuit was frivolous from the get go we had done extensive legal research its unfortunate we have to spend so much time and money on these things
6813068 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6813069 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6813070 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations

6813077 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6813078 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6813081 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

6813085 que se repita el a o que viene y que podamos mejorar s lo depende del xito que este a o tenga
6813086 hemos intentado configurar un cartel variado dentro de lo posible un cartel donde hay varios grupos de la provincia y uno de la regi n y a los que agradecemos su participaci n
6813087 at least the man couldve confused me for tiger woods
6813088 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6813089 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6813090 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6813091 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6813134 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6813135 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6813136 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes

6813151 in these times of high gasoline prices i believe the federal government should do all it can to ensure that federal agencies and departments are appropriately reducing gasoline consumption this goal can be accomplished with the adoption of personnel policies to limit unnecessary commuting

6813161 fue a ellos a los que se les pidi hacer silencio durante la audiencia
6813162 el d a martes se nos dio el derecho de palabra
6813163 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6813164 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6813165 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6813166 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6813168 um your dad was mad that we couldnt watch the girls on friday so he was wondering if we could take them to breckenridge with us
6813169 what makes you think chris is a good mate for amber
6813170 well he has a good job he owns his own house and you can tell that he really loves amber he always kisses or hugs her
6813171 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6813172 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6813173 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6813174 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6813175 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6813176 you are calling a dollar store and setting aside pencils
6813177 i was really excited to go out there and give usain his third world record
6813178 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6813179 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6813180 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6813181 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6813182 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6813183 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6813184 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6813185 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6813186 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are

6813193 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6813194 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6813195 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6813196 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6813197 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6813198 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6813199 the suspicious agreement means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution
6813200 no no to america no no to israel we will not allow iraq to be an american colony
6813201 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6813202 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6813203 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6813204 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6813205 the question isnt how many homes mccain has but how many homes does mccain have where he got a sweetheart deal involving tony rezko
6813206 all my close votes hes always with me whether its the budget or energy issues
6813207 no matter what it is hes always with us he just does not vote right on iraq
6813208 asked whether he meant lieberman reid whose stream of consciousness speaking style often leads to such flubs
6813209 i believe the third time will be the charm my first win fighting for the third time in germany and ill bring home my third world championship belt
6813210 i heard that valuev has been swimming to train for our fight
6813211 everything about training camp was good i worked very hard to get ready for this fight ive been working on a lot of stuff with manny like more balanced punching and a few new moves when we get into the ring i want him to be thinking about what hes going to do with me hes not going to fight the same guy he did the first time you cant let him stand there or hell throw punches all night long im going to take the fight to him and make him move around im going to stay on him surround him and show him different angles and more combination punching

6813214 sen john mccain threatened tuesday to cut short a speech to union leaders who booed his immigration views and later challenged his statements on organized labor and the iraq war
6813215 i dont think i need to tell you that there are jobs that americans will not do i dont think i have to tell you that there are the backbone of our economy
6813216 you know ive heard that statement before now my friends ill offer anybody here fifty dollars an hour if youll go pick lettuce in yuma this season and pick for the whole season so ok sign up ok when you sign up you sign up and youll be there for the whole season the whole season ok not just one day because you cant do it my friend
6813217 as ive said from the beginning the decision would be made on who we feel gives us the best opportunity to win the football game and right now we feel russell wilson will do that
6813218 he will be our starter as we go but we certainly feel that daniel evans has some things he can contribute to this football team as well russell is the starter and daniel is the backup but as daniel knows he is one play away from being the starter
6813219 i believe daniel and i can both step in and help this team win some games the team is really excited to go down to south carolina and we hope it will be a great game
6813220 im very excited about the opportunity to play on thursday
6813221 i know russell is going to do a great job hopefully we can both help the team go down and compete against the gamecocks

6813249 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6813250 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6813251 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6813273 the results of the survey demonstrate that women understand the importance of a healthy smile but worryingly they are not prepared to spend the time and money looking after their teeth fear of the dentist is an age old problem 24 are not willing to undergo corrective treatment based on fear but new treatments such as invisalign which is a non invasive procedure using a series of clear plastic aligners to straighten your teeth have been popular as they are discreet and because they are removable patients can brush and floss as normal invisalign gives me the chance to straighten teeth but without many of the treatment barriers that cause my patients to shy away from with traditional metal dental braces the cost for treatment is a lifetime investment so when you compare this to how much women spend on beauty treatments it is minimal

6813279 p ublished reports throughout 2006 and 2007 portrayed crystal as a gold digging hooker searching for a big payday or as an unstable troubled young woman the truth about crystals life her account of what happened on march 13 2006 accusations and the motives of the people criticizing her were never seriously explored

6813283 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6813284 the olympic committees decision to create the new sponsorship category of official language training and testing supplier in 2007 and invite aifly to fill this role was one of the most important decisions in ensuring the success of the beijing olympics the training and testing services that aifly provided to olympic volunteers over the years leading up to the games were invaluable to our preparations
6813285 once we were asked to take on this role we determined that considering the limited time scale and complexity of the training program that was needed it would be most effective to focus on training volunteers in language and skills that they would be most likely to encounter and need to use effectively during the olympic and paralympic games
6813286 we use different training methods and focus on different content depending on the role and location that each volunteer will be assigned during the olympics so for example for medical aid volunteers we emphasized role playing and maintained small groups of between 4 and 10 students during training
6813287 last may i participated in the language training for college volunteers
6813288 ive been to six olympic games the beijing olympics is much better than i expected all the volunteers are very kind theyve given me a lot of help most of them can speak english fluently i did not expect their language skills to be so strong or to provide such professional service
6813289 even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the justice department despite the fact that hamas and the palestine islamic jihad are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect the bank of china to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism

6813293 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6813294 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6813295 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6813296 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6813297 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6813298 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6813299 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6813300 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6813301 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6813302 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6813303 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6813304 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6813305 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own

6813309 his political zigzagging was evident when he joined kadima a mere 48 hours after announcing to the world that the likud was his political home forever and ever or when he fiercely objected to the construction of the security fence only to take charge of the operation or when it came time to vote on the gaza pullout where he turned from one of the moves most adamant opponents to one of its most enthused advocates almost overnight

6813311 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6813312 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6813313 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6813314 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6813315 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6813316 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth

6813320 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then we will have other things on top of that
6813321 wireless radios do not work together in fact they fight each other
6813322 the trend in naming pets is going toward more human names
6813323 they can really pick up on them it gets too complicated with more than that but give a name with a punch to it
6813324 any pet as soon as they can id their name that is the first step in training
6813325 she is a husky i wanted something to do with nature but as she was a member of my family too i just wanted her to have a name that a person could have too
6813326 ella is a name i have always liked and in my job as a name expert compiling data and giving advice about baby names to people all the time it is one that i had seen that i really liked
6813327 it is a very popular name though and one that i wouldnt use for a child of my own only because i see so many little ellas and bellas being named every day
6813328 dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations people would keep them outside in a dog house

6813332 he has apologized to the board for his misuse of his state laptop and we have accepted his apology but sternly warned that any future infractions will be treated more severely the board also issued a verbal and written reprimand to rex
6813333 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6813334 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6813335 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6813336 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6813337 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6813338 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6813347 in that time machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6813348 and progress in the next 100 years will be more like the progress of the past 20 000 years because of technology
6813349 we will need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors which give more power lower leakage and better density
6813350 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then we will have other things on top of that

6813355 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6813356 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6813357 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6813358 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6813359 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs

6813361 we believe it is extremely important that usda be aware of this in spite of senators grassley and dorgans arguments to the contrary
6813362 usda will have to develop entirely new tests for adjusted gross farm income and adjusted gross non farm income
6813363 unlike the current adjusted gross income test which can be verified using a tax return if necessary the new tests will require usda to develop definitions and procedures to calculate farm and non farm income
6813364 the council has established a working group of top cpas to assist us in developing recommendations and were also working with some outstanding law firms with expertise in this area we have also included representatives from rice and peanut groups in the income testing working group
6813365 we will continue to be actively involved in the process of developing a reasonable and equitable procedure to apply the new income tests since the consequence of failing the tests are so severe
6813366 very few of us were satisfied with the farm payment reform that was finally agreed to in the farm bill so this is an opportunity for the bush administration that youd think theyd be crying for to leave its mark in this area
6813367 the farm bill left some big loopholes that we can start to close with the right action by the administration

6813488 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6813489 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6813490 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6813491 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6813492 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6813493 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6813494 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught

6813496 even after the sentance change i though your overall approach for this piece was too salesy for a press release i hired someone else to edit your work and the enclosed release is closer to what i was looking for

6813498 i have to admit that i too am disappointed with the way this assignment turned out i guess however its inevitable that a few clients just will not be a good match most of my press release clients are so pleased with the press release distribution service results they receive that they come back to me every single month for a new press release once my services are paid for in full the copy is yours to do with as you please of course but when you overrule my professional suggestions and expertise please note that i cannot be held responsible for the lack of success you receive with the altered version

6813525 its hard to believe that a private school established just 10 years ago in a former roadside bar offers a more credible dropout recovery program than 22 public school districts whose applications for a grant were rejected
6813526 just as interesting is that this private school would get public tax dollars just as james leininger turns off his money spigot for a privately funded voucher scheme that allowed the school to open in the first place
6813527 james leininger has failed repeatedly to get a private school voucher scheme through the legislature
6813528 now the governors handpicked education commissioner has twisted the legislatures intent by creating a backdoor voucher scheme that puts public funding for private schools ahead of our neighborhood public schools

6813566 haben sie aufgrund der 19 sekunden vorsprung vor dem abschlie enden 3000 m lauf fest mit gold gerechnet
6813567 ich wusste dass ich schnell laufen kann also war mir eine medaille so gut wie sicher aber f r gold musste ich verdammt hart arbeiten denn heather fell lie sich nicht absch tteln

6813580 the film was billed as inspired by empire of debt but it is an extraordinarily poor and biased rendering of a very good book
6813581 before the movie started a debt clock marked the ever increasing 55 trillion debt figure calculated by mr
6813582 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
6813583 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
6813584 mankinds problems can no longer be solved by national governments what is needed is a world government
6813585 its discussions throughout were founded upon belief in the unqualified victory by the united nations it predicted as an absolute prerequisite for world peace the continuing strength of the united nations through unbroken cooperation after the war
6813586 machinery for a world government in which the united nations will serve as a nucleus in order to prepare in time the foundations for a future world order
6813587 secured the consent of stalin to establish a general organization for the maintenance of international peace and security
6813588 great popular support and enthusiasm for the united nations policies should be built up well organized and fully articulated the opposition must be rendered so impotent that it will be unable to gather any significant support in the senate against the united nations charter and the treaties which will follow
6813589 the efforts of the united nations to bring about a world community favorable to peace and to strengthen the united nations into a world government of limited powers adequate to prevent a war and having direct jurisdiction over the individual
6813590 your organization can perform an important service by continuing to emphasize that world peace can only come through world law our goal is world peace
6813591 the american communists worked energetically and tirelessly to lay the foundations for the united nations which we were sure would come into existence
6813592 secretary general u thant praised vladimir i lenin founder of the soviet union as a political leader whose ideals were reflected in the un charter
6813593 can be established only by victory of socialism in different countries or groups of countries after which the proletariat republics would unite on federal lines with those already in existence and this system would expand at length forming the world union of soviet socialist republics
6813594 the masses know that peace is possible only on the basis of cooperation among the existing states the soviet union is fighting to have the united nations as effective as possible
6813595 the un commands a great reservoir of support in our country people should write president kennedy telling him do not withdraw from the un restore the un to the grand design of franklin roosevelt the design for peaceful coexistence
6813596 strengthening of the united nations as a universal instrument of peace
6813597 we the people of the united nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war
6813598 the secret of the bomb should be committed to a world government and the u s a should announce its readiness to give it to a world government
6813599 resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that it is the sense of the congress that it should be a fundamental objective of the foreign policy of the united states to support and strengthen the united nations and to seek its development into a world federation open to all nations with defined and limited powers adequate to preserve peace and prevent aggression through the enactment interpretation and enforcement of world law
6813600 we in the united states would be declaring our willingness to join with other nations in transferring to the un constitutional authority to administer and enforce law that was binding on national governments and their individual citizens
6813601 we signed the resolution believing we were sponsoring a movement to set up a stronger power within the united nations for world peace then we learned that various organizations were working on state legislatures and on peace movements for world government action under which the entire u s government would be submerged in a super world government perhaps we should have read the fine print in the first place we do not intend to continue in the role of sponsors of any movement which undermine u s sovereignty many congressmen feel as i do we will make our position thoroughly clear
6813602 we can create now with russia if possible without russia if necessary an overwhelming collective front open to all nations under a law just to all
6813603 american atomic military and economic superiority is only temporary it is essential before that superiority is lost that there be created an international organization with strength to enforce the peace
6813604 the establishment of a federal union would involve not only basic economic and social changes but also important changes in the structure of the united states government it is very doubtful if the american people are ready to amend the constitution to the extent necessary to give an atlantic union the powers it would need to be effective
6813605 anything less than world government would be merely a stopgap
6813606 a provision of a treaty or other international agreement which conflicts with this constitution or which is not made in pursuance thereof shall not be supreme law of the land nor be of any force or effect
6813607 the congress of the united states because of the power granted to it by treaty could enact laws taking over all private and parochial schools destroying all local school boards and substitute a federal system congress could by law provide for censoring all press telegrams congress could utilize this power to put into effect a complete system of socialized medicine from cradle to grave even legislate compulsory labor if it found that the goal of full employment required such legislation or would be served by it
6813608 when the existing governments and ruling theories of life the decaying religious and the decaying political forms of today have sufficiently lost prestige through failure and catastrophe then and then only will world wide reconstruction be possible
6813609 tinkering with the united nations will not help us if we agree with the new york times that our only hope is in the ultimate abolition of war through an ultimate world government
6813610 i am more deeply convinced that the united nations represents the soundest hope for peace in the world
6813611 progressive reduction of the war making capability of the nations and the simultaneous strengthening of international institutions to settle disputes and maintain the peace
6813612 the first stage would significantly reduce the capabilities of nations to wage war by reducing the armed forced of the nations nuclear capabilities would be reduced by treaties and un peace keeping powers would be strengthened the second stage would provide further substantial reductions in the armed forces and the establishment of a permanent international peace force within the united nations the third stage would have the nations retaining only those forces required for maintaining internal order but the united states would provide manpower for the united nations peace force
6813613 keep the peace all states will reaffirm their obligations under the un charter to refrain from the threat of use of any type armed force
6813614 our task of creating a socialist america can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed
6813615 the fixed determined and approved policy of the government of the united states
6813616 the parties to the treaty would progressively strengthen the united nations police force until it had sufficient armed forces and armaments so that no state could challenge it
6813617 to consider the problems involved in the contingency of a transition to a general condition of peace and to recommend procedures for dealing with this contingency
6813618 because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the establishment of this group and in view of the nature of its finding we do not recommend that this report be released for publication such actions would not be in the public interest a lay reader unexposed to the exigencies of higher political or military responsibility will misconstrue the purposed of this project and the intent we urge that the circulation of the report be closely restricted to those whos responsibilities require that they be apprised of its contents
6813619 would almost certainly not be in the best interest of stable society
6813620 war has provided both ancient and modern societies with a dependable system for stabilizing and controlling national economies no alternate method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy that has shown itself remotely comparable in scope or effectiveness war fills certain functions essential to the stability of our society until other ways of filling them are developed the war system must be maintained and improved in effectiveness
6813621 provides anti social elements with an acceptable role in the social structure the younger and more dangerous of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the selective service system man destroys surplus members of his own species by organized warfare enables the physically deteriorating older generation to maintain control of the younger destroying it if necessary
6813622 war is virtually synonymous with nationhood the elimination of war implies the inevitable elimination of national sovereignty and the traditional nation state
6813623 a a comprehensive social welfare program directed toward maximum improvement of general conditions of human life b a giant open end space research program aimed at unreachable targets c a permanent ritualized ultra elaborate disarmament inspection system and variant of such a system
6813624 to caricature the bankruptcy of the think tank mentality by pursuing its style of scientific thinking to its logical ends
6813625 to provoke thinking about the unthinkable the conversion to a peacetime economy and the absurdity of the arms race
6813626 the establishment of world order depends not only on its intrinsic desirability and viability but also on the support of men and groups who decide to dedicate themselves to the completion of such a goal as increasing sectors of developed and underdeveloped societies begin to realize the urgent necessity of world order the viability of its establishment and the fact that it can be achieved by adopting measures which are reasonable in themselves none of the governments will be able to escape public pressure for establishing world order it is incumbent upon the intellectuals to play the decisive role in the formation of pressure groups in favor of world order the establishment of world order demands the mobilization of groups dedicated to international pressure for the gradual implantation of that world order the negotiated establishment of world order is theoretically possible and practically feasible since in the last analysis the probable effects of nuclear conflagration have made way an impractical alternative to the peaceful solution of contemporary problems
6813627 within two decades the institutional framework for a world economic community will be in place when aspects of individual sovereignty will be given over to a supernational authority
6813628 the only eventual answer is some kind of world government whether it is capitalist or communist
6813629 a meeting was held may 24 1976 through july 4 1976 in valley forge park king of prussia pa to formulate a new world constitution elaborating a bill of human rights for the world and setting up a permanent secretariat of human rights there to superintend the government of the world
6813630 only a full scale world government will save the world from nuclear holocaust
6813631 realizing that humanity today has come to a turning point in history and that we are on the threshold of a new world order which promises to usher in an era of peace prosperity justice and harmony we the citizens of the world hereby resolve to establish a world federation to be governed in accordance with this constitution for the federation of earth
6813632 to all presidents prime ministers kings queens and other heads of governments and national parliaments
6813633 we who sign this appeal to you are ready for a democratic federal world government under a ratified world constitution will you support this move for a federal world government will you appoint official delegates to the world constituent assembly now is the time to assure the dawn and full blooming of a new era for humanity on planet earth
6813634 viable agencies of the un are transferred to the world government
6813635 i would rather have peace in the world than be president
6813636 our goal must be not peace in our time but peace for all time
6813637 i do not wish to seem overdramatic but i can only conclude from the information that is available to me as secretary general that the members of the united nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race to improve the human environment to diffuse the population explosion and supply the required momentum to world development efforts if such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade then i very much fear the problems i mentioned will have reached staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control
6813638 to achieve one world government it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism their loyalty to family traditions and national identification
6813639 we must strengthen the united nations as a first step toward a world government we americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty
6813640 increasingly placed an overfed bureaucracy at the service of a coalition of soviet bloc and third world countries
6813641 the united nations international childrens emergency fund unicef appropriated 59 000 000 between 1947 and 1958 to communist countries in a ratio not unlike that of other un ventures the united states has furnished 42 000 000 of the money as with other aid programs the assistance does not go to the needy but it is administered through governments
6813642 the charter is built to prepare for war not to promote peace the charter is a war document not a peace document
6813643 not only does the charter organization un not prevent future wars but it makes it practically certain that we shall have future wars and as to such wars it takes from us u s the power to declare them to choose the side on which we shall fight and to determine what forces and military equipment we shall use in the war and to control and command our sons who do the fighting
6813644 i urged the ratification of the united nations charter by the senate but i stated at that time the american people should be under no illusions that the charter assures lasting peace but now we must realize that the united nations has failed to give us even a remote hope of lasting peace instead it adds the dangers of wars which now surround us
6813645 the whole purpose and indeed the method of the un is to use armed might against any nation presumed to be an aggressor its function is to make war
6813646 the united nations is the greatest fraud in all history its purpose is to destroy the united states
6813647 i think the united nations is dangerous to our republic and therefore we ought not to participate
6813648 my vision is that we would become an instrument working as much as possible through the united nations for freedom and democracy and human rights and global economic growth
6813649 it is the sacred principles enshrined in the united nations charter to which the american people will henceforth pledge their allegiance
6813650 a new more effective un one that will have the power to stop wars and arbitrate disputes between national groups
6813651 whenever in the past europe has been united by force the unity lasted no longer than the space of a single reign
6813652 let us have the united states of europe let us have continental federation let us have european freedom
6813653 hard as it is to say now i trust that the european family may act unitedly as one under a council of europe i look forward to a united states of europe
6813654 we must build a kind of united states of europe
6813655 collaboration in economic social and cultural matters and for collective self defense
6813656 greater european unity to improve the conditions of life and principle human value in europe and to uphold the principles of parliamentary democracy the rule of law and human rights
6813657 principles of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within their jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms
6813658 the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that if such an attack occurs each of them will assist the party or parties so attacked to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area
6813659 as long as europe remains divided it is no match for the soviet union europe must unite
6813660 once a common market interest has been created then political union will come naturally
6813661 the treaty of rome which brought the common market into being was nurtured at the bilderberg meetings
6813662 the europe of the future when it finally unites politically as well as economically will be the mightiest force on earth
6813663 make no mistake about it we are not in business we are in politics we are building the united states of europe
6813664 if the europe of tomorrow could muster the political will it could become a co equal of the other two superpowers the united states and russia
6813665 the european common market is emerging to shake the world economically and politically
6813666 if the bush administration has a vision of the new world order it is time to share it with the europeans and americans because a new world order is precisely what is emerging on the continent of europe today
6813667 transfer of decision making power from member states to the community
6813668 we cant lick world communism no counterinsurgency plans will work we must compromise and co exist with communism
6813669 it is difficult to reeducate the people who have been brought up on nationalism to the idea of relinquishing part of their sovereignty to a supranational body
6813670 european integration is our goal and where the politicians have failed we industrialists hope to succeed
6813671 whether he sen joseph mccarthy dies by an assassins bullet or is eliminated in the normal american way of getting rid of boils on the body politic i prophecy that by the time we hold our next meeting he will be gone from the american scene
6813672 here comes our greatest difficulty for the governments of the free nations are elected by the people and if they do something the people dont like they are thrown out it is difficult to reeducate the people who have been brought up on nationalism to the idea of relinquishing part of their sovereignty to a supernational body
6813673 subordination of national ambitions to the idea of the international community
6813674 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years but the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supernational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries
6813675 conditioning the public to accept the idea of a un army that could by force impose its will on the internal affairs of any nation
6813676 today americans would be outraged if un forces entered los angeles to restore order tomorrow they will be grateful
6813677 bilderbergs only activity is its annual conference at the meetings no resolutions are proposed no votes taken and no policy statements issued
6813678 a small flexible informal and off the record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced
6813679 the men of the mind the intellectuals of the world the originators and innovators in every line of industry go on strike when the men of creative ability in every profession in protest against regulation quit and disappear
6813680 i am destroying danconia copper consciously deliberately by plan and by my own hand i have to plan it carefully and work as hard as if i were producing a fortune in order not to let them notice it and stop me in order not to let them seize the mines until it is too late i shall destroy every last bit of it and every last penny of my fortune and every ounce of copper that could feed the looters i shall not leave it as i found it i shall leave it as sebastian danconia found it then let them try to exist without him or me
6813681 we produced the wealth of the world but we let our enemies write its moral code
6813682 dagney we whove been called materialists were the only ones who know how little value or meaning there is in material objects were the ones who create their value and meaning we can afford to give them up we are the soul of which railroads copper mines steel mines and oil wells are the body and they are living entities that beat day and night like our hearts in the sacred function of supporting human life but only so long as they remain our body only so long as they remain the expression the reward and the property of achievement without us they are corpses and their sole product is poison not wealth or food the poison of disintegration that turns men into hordes of scavengers you do not have to depend on any material possessions they depend on you you create them you own the one and only tool of production leave them the carcass of that railroad leave them all the rusted nails and rotted ties and gutted engines but dont leave them your mind
6813683 and the same will be happening in every other industry wherever machines are used the machines which they thought could replace our minds plane crashes oil tank explosions blast furnace breakouts high tension wire electrocutions subway cave ins and trestle collapses theyll see them all the very machines that made their life so safe will now make it a continuous peril you know that the cities will be hit worst of all the cities were made by the railroads and will go with them when the rails are cut the city of new york will starve in two days thats all the supply of food its got its fed by a continent three thousand miles long how will they carry food to new york by directive and ox cart but first before it happens theyll go through the whole of the agony through the shrinking the shortages the hunger riots the stampeding violence in the midst of the growing stillness theyll lose the airplanes first then their automobiles then their trucks then their horsecarts their factories will stop then their furnaces and their radios then their electric light system will go
6813684 he had quit the twentieth century he was living in a garret in a slum neighborhood he stepped to the window and pointed at the skyscrapers of the city he said that we had to extinguish the lights of the world and when we would see the lights of new york go out we would know that our job was done
6813685 the world is falling apart so fast that it will soon be starving but we will be able to support ourselves in this valley
6813686 there is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human history the men who have carried the world on their shoulders have kept it alive have endured torture as sole payment well their turn has come let the world discover who they are what they do and what happens when they refuse to function this is the strike of the men of the mind
6813687 but years later when we saw the lights going out one after another in the great factories that had stood like mountains for generations when we saw the gates closing and the conveyer belts turning still when we saw the roads growing empty and the streams of cars draining off when it began to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and the world was crumbling quietly
6813688 the plane was above the peaks of the skyscrapers when suddenly with the abruptness of a shudder as if the ground had parted to engulf it the city had disappeared from the face of the earth it took them a moment to realize that the panic had reached the power stations and the lights of new york had gone out
6813689 we are the radicals for capitalism because it is the only system geared to the life of a rational being the method of capitalisms destruction rests on never letting the world discover what it is that is being destroyed
6813690 i trust that no one will tell me that men such as i write about dont exist that this book has been written and published is proof that they do
6813691 the purpose of this book is to prevent itself from being prophetic
6813692 to mine it now its coal to mine it later it will be like gold
6813693 we have formed a very exclusive club and we are now united we are making history
6813694 have a critical and adverse effect on our relations with the moderate arab producing countries
6813695 unless the political struggle is settled in a manner satisfactory to the arabs
6813696 we believe in fact that the need will quickly become evident for social innovation to match technical change for radical reform of the institutions and political processes at all levels including the highest that of world polity and since intellectual enlightenment is without effect if it is not also political the club of rome also will encourage the creation of a world forum where statesmen policy makers and scientists can discuss the dangers and hopes for the future global system without the constraints of formal intergovernmental negotiation
6813697 there is no other viable alternative to the future survival of civilization than a new global community under a common leadership
6813698 the club of romes mission is to act as a global catalyst of change that is free of any political ideological or business interest the club of rome contributes to the solution of what it calls the world problematique the complex set of the most crucial problems political social economic technological environmental psychological and cultural facing humanity it does so taking a global long term and interdisciplinary prospective aware of the increasing interdependence of nations and the globalization of problems that pose predicaments beyond the capacity of individual countries
6813699 the solution of these crises can be developed only in a global context with full and explicit recognition of the emerging world system and on a long term basis
6813700 it is necessary that the united states cut its population by two thirds within the next 50 years
6813701 if the worlds consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time the earth would strike its limits within a century
6813702 are correctly understood as political statements of intent the intent on the part of such policy centers as the council on foreign relations the trilateral commission and the international monetary fund to pursue policies that will result not only in the death of the 120 million cited in the reports but in the death of upwards of two billion people by the year 2000
6813703 damaged by conflicting policies of three major countries and blocs roughly patched up here and there the existing international economic order is visibly coming apart at the seams the prospect of the necessity of the recourse to triage deciding who must be saved is a very grim one indeed but if lamentably events should come to such a pass the right to make such decisions cannot be left to just a few nations because it would lend themselves to ominous power over life of the worlds hungry
6813704 there will be no peace in the tormented world only a programmed and systematic series of wars and calamities until the plotters have gained their objective an exhausted world willing to submit to a planned marxist economy and total and meek enslavement in the name of peace
6813705 if there is not a cure for aids within the next thirteen years tens of millions will die
6813706 a synthetic biological agent an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired
6813707 an attempt should be made to see if viruses can in fact exert selective effects on immune function the possibility should be looked into that the immune response to the virus itself may be impaired if the inflicting virus damages more or less selectively the cell responding to the virus
6813708 scientists throughout the world join with members of this committee in voluntarily deferring experiments linking animal viruses
6813709 i dont think there is any doubt that aids is a man made problem the question is whether it was created either accidentally or intentionally i believe the aids virus was requested predicted produced and deployed
6813710 if one analyzes the genes of the human aids virus and the genes of the bovine leukemia virus of cattle and the visna virus of sheep and compares them the genes appear related how is it possible that the bovine visna virus which looks like aids and produces an aids like disease and which produced pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in chimpanzees in 1972 has not been analyzed and compared with aids until 1987 when characterization and molecular cloning of bovine lente latin for slow virus related to human immunodeficiency virus was published in nature magazine matthew gonda the author described a virus that looks like aids named bovine visna virus and suggested that it was most closely related to aids and may well be its precursor
6813711 there is little evidence for homosexual activity among african aids patients and it appears to be transmitted through heterosexual contact or exposure to blood through insect bites
6813712 human retroviruses could be transmitted by mosquitoes or within the parasite itself
6813713 from saliva suggests that direct contact with this body fluid should be avoided
6813714 there is a risk of infecting others by exposure of others through oral genital contact or intimate kissing french kissing
6813715 at this point live aids virus has been isolated from blood semen serum saliva urine and now tears if the virus exists in these fluids the better part of wisdom dictates that we assume the possibility that it can also be transmitted by these routes it seems reasonable therefore that aids victims should not donate blood or blood products should not contribute to semen banks should not donate tissues or organs to organ banks should not work as dental or medical technicians and should probably not be employed as food handlers
6813716 who tells you categorically that aids is not contracted by saliva is not telling you the truth aids may in fact be transmissible by tears saliva bodily fluids and mosquito bites
6813717 i think aids is going to devastate the american medical system
6813718 no natural immunity could have been acquired and no cure exists
6813719 studies at army laboratories have shown that the aids virus would be an extremely poor biological warfare agent
6813720 make recommendations on ways of breaking through existing international political impasse in north south negotiations for global development
6813721 basic proposals on which global agreement is both essential and possible
6813722 would not interfere with ongoing international negotiations and would make recommendations to help improve the climate of north south relations
6813723 called for a full scale restructuring of the global economy
6813724 to influence public opinion to help change government attitudes as well as to make proposals for revitalizing north south negotiations
6813725 greater power for the international monetary fund and the world bank
6813726 transfer of wealth must be tackled not out of charity but to ward off economic collapse hence the global super summit now worldwide security is not achieved by granting more aid but by reshaping global structures by greater regionalized planning and development
6813727 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
6813728 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama

6813730 i have been quiet about linux this week because i have been busy trying several new versions in the process i have learned quite a bit mandriva linux 2009 beta 2 released

6813737 when the long awaited gentoo 2008 0 release finally hit mirrors last month the two largest groups of users found themselves out of luck using sysctl to change kernel tunables on linux
6813738 sysctl is a very versatile command and can be used either in its standalone form or through the modification of linux 2 6 26 opens up to debugging
6813739 no piece of software is immune to defects which is why its important to use tools that help find and fix bugs thats the idea with how long have you been a linux user
6813740 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6813741 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6813742 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6813743 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6813744 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6813745 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6813746 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6813747 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6813748 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6813749 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6813750 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6813751 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6813752 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6813753 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6813754 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6813755 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6813756 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6813757 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6813758 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6813759 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6813760 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6813761 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6813762 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6813763 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6813764 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6813765 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6813766 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6813767 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6813768 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6813769 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6813770 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6813771 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6813772 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6813773 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6813774 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6813775 es freut uns dass wir diese sache aus der welt schaffen konnten

6813789 a la falta de inter s de las autoridades por mejorar el sistema de compra
6813790 la falta de medicamentos es real estamos tratando de ordenar el tema
6813791 una farmacia privada levanta el tel fono y hace una compra directa nosotros no podemos hacerlo tenemos que prever que cantidad de medicamentos se van a usar y llamar a una licitaci n p blica
6813792 les doy la raz n a los empleados porque no tenemos un sistema gil de compra
6813793 no es algo nuevo viene de los ltimos cuatro o cinco a os porque tenemos serias dificultades para comprar en el marco de la ley 6 que rige las compras en el estado
6813794 los medicamentos tienen una fluctuaci n estacional y de mercado podemos prever que vamos a consumir determinados medicamentos y resulta que un laboratorio lanza un medicamento los m dicos lo prescriben y nosotros no lo tenemos
6813795 si bien la ley de gen ricos dice que podemos tener el medicamento en gen ricos la elecci n es del paciente yo puedo ofrecer del otro pero si la gente no lo quiere yo tengo que derivar la receta
6813796 la postura no es negarnos rotundamente a dar un aumento la postura es reconducir el presupuesto y ver como nos dan los n meros y de ah discutir un porcentaje que no se si ser del 20 nadie dijo que no todo esto se fue agrandando y nos fuimos peleando cuando no hay voluntad del directorio de decir que no

6813798 salimos de un sistema de gestionar tres o cuatro expedientes mensuales a un sistema donde se gestionan 170 expedientes mensuales de prestadores esto hizo que se readecuen los circuitos administrativos y hubo algunas dificultades porque en el marco de la emergencia fueron hechas actas acuerdo observadas por el tribunal de cuentas se autorizaron prestaciones por fuera de convenio que tambi n fueron observadas y esto hace que los tr mites se retrasen
6813799 a partir de este mes va a estar normalizado los prestadores han tenido bastante paciencia es cierto que ha habido reclamos por esto pero agradecemos la paciencia

6813805 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6813806 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6813807 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6813841 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6813842 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6813843 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6813844 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6813845 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6813846 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6813901 we present the detection and characterization of a peculiar low mass protostar iras 22129 7000 located 0 4 pc from the cederblad 201 the cold circumstellar envelope surrounding the object has been mapped through its 1 2 mm dust continuum emission with iram 30 m mambo the deeply embedded protostar is clearly detected with spitzer given the large near and mid ir excess in its spectral energy distribution but large submillimeter to bolometric luminosity ratio it must be a transition class 0 i source and or a multiple stellar system targeted observations of several molecular lines from co 13co c18o hco and dco have been obtained the presence of a collimated molecular outflow mapped with the cso telescope in the co line suggests that the protostar disk system is still accreting material from its natal envelope indeed optically thick line profiles from high density tracers such as hco show a redshifted absorption asymmetry reminiscent of inward motions we construct a preliminary physical model of the circumstellar envelope including radial density and temperature gradients velocity field and turbulence that reproduces the observed line profiles and estimates the ionization fraction the presence of both mechanical and nonionizing far ultraviolet fuv radiative input makes the region an interesting case to study triggered star formation
6813902 cold dark clouds are nearby members of the densest and coldest phase in the galactic interstellar medium and represent the most accessible sites where stars like our sun are currently being born newly discovered ir dark clouds are likely precursors to stellar clusters at large scales dark clouds present filamentary mass distributions with motions dominated by supersonic turbulence at small subparsec scales a population of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse of the conditions prior to stellar birth recent studies of starless cores reveal a combination of simple physical properties together with a complex chemical structure dominated by the freeze out of molecules onto cold dust grains elucidating this combined structure is both an observational and theoretical challenge whose solution will bring us closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses to form stars

6813962 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6813963 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
6813964 change control is a complex process inadequate change control exposes a company to product liability actions results in product recalls causes internal confusion and is a serious violation of the quality system regulation

6813996 in april the federal aviation administration inspected american airline boeing md 80s and found a maintenance problem wiring bundles that had been improperly wrapped and attached inside wheel wells the airline canceled 3 300 flights

6814009 we dont believe she was taken by another animal so she is out there
6814010 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
6814011 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
6814012 but they will be doing it more and more now
6814013 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6814014 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6814015 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
6814016 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
6814017 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
6814018 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
6814019 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
6814020 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
6814021 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
6814022 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6814023 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
6814024 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6814025 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6814026 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumor
6814027 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply helping us to identify the person who posted it
6814028 hes got the burden of inspiring the youth as they go forward

6814036 it provides the best audio convenience amp performance i could imagine and we all enjoy having the voice search interface
6814037 its deeply troubling and unfortunate that president bush should fire this parting shot at womens access to basic health care in the waning days of his administration
6814038 time and time again he has put political and ideological concerns above the best interests of the american people and this is yet another example
6814039 we continue to be very concerned about the scope and impact of this proposed rule it leaves open the possibility that institutions and individuals can deny access to birth control and permits individuals to refuse to provide even counseling about basic heath care services
6814040 for years federal law has carefully balanced protections for individual religious liberty and patients access to reproductive health care the proposed regulations appear to take patients health needs out of the equation
6814041 at a time when more and more americans are either uninsured or struggling with the soaring costs of health care the federal government should be expanding not hampering access to important health services
6814042 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area

6814047 voters care a lot more about candidates personal ethics than about how many houses or residences or doghouses that john and cindy mccain own
6814048 clearly colorado voters are not jumping up and down about the dnc being held in denver
6814049 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
6814050 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organizations to enter at once to clean the affected areas
6814051 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
6814052 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
6814053 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
6814054 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
6814055 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous
6814056 there are so many of these lying around the fields are full of them
6814057 our government is not supposed to collect information on the innocent activities and movements of its citizens just in case they later commit a crime
6814058 this program illustrates why america needs more robust and across the board privacy laws
6814059 the customs and border protection agency function is taking the approach that the border is a constitution free zone
6814060 congress needs to step in and reassert the american values of limited intrusion on americans private lives
6814061 this is just the latest in a long list of misguided dhs security policies from trying to waive all laws at the border to building a wall at the u s border to redirecting the automated tracking system from assessing the risk of cargo to assessing the risk of travelers to the most recent controversy over detaining laptops at airports it is clear the next administration will need to drastically rethink all of these wrongheaded policies
6814062 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
6814063 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
6814064 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice
6814065 during my practice as an ob gyn i witnessed this first hand but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen
6814066 our national parks the washington monument petrified forest yosemite mesa verde and many others are national treasures
6814067 we need action to protect them for our children and grandchildren
6814068 americans expect the federal government to take care of our national parks
6814069 well be looking to the new administration and congress to fulfill that promise
6814070 deliverance from addiction through a personal relationship with jesus christ and practical application of biblical principles
6814071 teen challenge boasts about its program being saturated with fundamentalist christianity and makes it clear that required participation in religious activities is key to its approach
6814072 bush administration officials have claimed that they do not fund religious activities but this grant suggests otherwise
6814073 apparently their policy is to do it until they get caught
6814074 tax funds were being funneled to this organization even though it openly boasts about its religious content and theres no evidence its approach even works
6814075 this incident is a perfect example of whats so wrong with faith based initiatives
6814076 this was a clear example of unconstitutional support of religious coercion and discrimination im glad we were able to bring the matter to an appropriate conclusion
6814077 nothing is happening at all i am not thinking of next year now and will not until the end of the season
6814078 i am not talking to anyone now at all i am fully focused on this years championship and i am not worried about next year
6814079 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
6814080 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
6814081 we believe the games are going to move ahead the agenda of the social and human rights as far as possible the games are going to be a force for good
6814082 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
6814083 will anyone wonder after the games are over why the chinese government remains intransigent about human rights
6814084 by the way the use and occupancy didnt come through yet
6814085 the new system we implemented this year is more proactive
6814086 a clubs expenditure is continuously monitored throughout the season which should prevent some accidental breaches that have occurred in the past
6814087 although retrospective in nature we do encourage all clubs in the national league in advance of the season to work to an agreed salary cap
6814088 imagine you got a lousy haircut and complained about it and you got this response
6814089 well of course your haircut looks bad what do you expect you only paid us for a haircut you didnt also give us enough money to provide you with all the other services you need to look your best next time pay us triple the price and we wont just give you a haircut well also give you a manicure and a new set of clothes then your haircut will look great
6814090 like kids need so much we should totally provide them with everything they need
6814091 yeah like there should be a health thing and a poverty thing and a food thing
6814092 school spending has been rising much faster than inflation for over fifty years historically weve done a great job getting state legislatures to direct enormous geysers of money into the government school system and in the past when people asked why our results were so lousy we just told them we needed more money but now that spending is over 10 000 per student theyre not swallowing that as much as they used to options
6814093 we definitely need to do more to shift the blame for educational failure to something thats outside of schools control
6814094 agreed but how can we do that in a way that continues to increase our budgets
6814095 well weve always said we cant be expected to teach kids if theyre poor or sick or have anything at all wrong with them right so lets tell them all social services should be brought into schools
6814096 why mccain is right on russia and right on health care
6814097 this is one of six or seven community service projects that pia cares has implemented in recent years
6814098 part of the pia cares mission statement is to improve the environment of disadvantaged communities by contributing professionally designed interior plant installations the volunteers who worked on the project enhanced the center and created an environment where seniors can enjoy the many benefits that plants provide
6814099 the plants not only bestow their long recognized healing and health benefits to the centers seniors they offer an opportunity to participate in their care and maintenance a passion for many residents
6814100 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
6814101 theres a great demand already our office gets all kinds of phone calls from hotels asking where to get bicycles
6814102 whereas all the other programs around the world got subsidized by municipal governments in one way or another
6814103 we need to determine where the best locations for hubs are how many bicycles could work do we do it in the downtown core do we do it where there are subways and intermodal transportation hubs

6814105 as changes in habitat become more severe and seasonal rates of change more rapid catastrophic mortality events that have yet to be realized on a large scale are expected to occur
6814106 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears

6814108 were excited to be attracting scientists of the highest caliber who will respond to the most pressing marine conservation issues of the day
6814109 the institute for ocean conservation science will provide a whole new capacity for somas to address questions that will improve public policy to benefit residents of new york state and beyond
6814110 our oceans are in a state of emergency and need immediate help
6814111 the institute for ocean conservation science will generate the science needed to better safeguard threatened marine life and ecosystems and we will use those findings to shape smarter policy our research team will build on the school of marine and atmospheric sciences impressive scientific track record and bring a strong conservation focus to the school together well be an even more powerful force
6814112 we believe that the new institute and the lenfest task force will help to further our understanding of changes taking place in the sea and ultimately improve our ability to protect the global marine environment
6814113 it is obvious that species and their habitats are interconnected but those connections have too often been ignored to the detriment of marine life
6814114 for many years somas focused research on marine resource management issues through its living marine resources institute limri the establishment of the institute for ocean conservation science will strengthen our commitment to solving urgent environmental problems
6814115 we are thrilled to welcome the institute as an important new part of our university

6814135 as ive traveled throughout texas this month i continue to hear from texas families and seniors about the challenges of affording health care and being able to access the kind of specialized care they need the number of uninsured individuals in texas is unacceptably high and our nations health care system is in serious need of broad reforms
6814136 unfortunately like many other pressing issues health care reform has taken a back seat to partisan games in congress
6814137 i strongly believe our first step should be strengthening and preserving the patient physician relationship
6814138 we should allow small business owners to pool their buying power and gain the same access to insurance rates that larger businesses enjoy
6814139 health care is a tough issue that requires all hands on deck working for the long term interests of patients and providers we need to make sure all texans have access to top notch health care facilities like the texas spine amp joint hospital
6814140 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue

6814144 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6814145 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them

6814201 fda concludes that irradiation of iceberg lettuce and spinach conducted in accordance with good manufacturing practices will reduce or eliminate bacterial populations
6814202 i hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
6814203 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6814204 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food

6814212 wahrscheinlich gibt es ein paar safety car phasen wenn man irgendwo einschl gt dann steht man meistens mitten auf der strecke das muss man in die strategie einkalkulieren
6814213 es gibt zwei stellen wo man es probieren kann einmal auf turn zw lf und einmal auf turn 17 da sind auch die vorkurven ein bisschen schwieriger und da kann es sein dass einer mal einen fehler macht
6814214 die strecke ist schon drin aber es ist nicht so wie in barcelona wo alle fahrer schon jeden meter auswendig kennen
6814215 hier gibt es situationen wo man in einem streckenabschnitt durch eine kleinigkeit die man anders macht wieder ein zehntelchen findet das wird bis ins rennen gehen dass man sich immer wieder leicht verbessert
6814216 es war ein ganz guter tag wir konnten unser programm abspulen und das neue getriebe hat auch ganz gut funktioniert
6814217 wir haben uns heute an unser programm gehalten bei dem es darum ging eine maximale distanz zur ckzulegen und unsere simulationen zu verifizieren
6814218 der kurs ist sowohl interessant als auch herausfordernd und der letzte sektor ist definitiv mein favorit und im cockpit ziemlich aufregend
6814219 die ersten ergebnisse des heutigen tages sind ermutigend aber wir m ssen nun weiter hart arbeiten um morgen eine solide qualifying einheit zu haben und sicherzustellen dass wir im rennen eine gute leistung zeigen
6814220 ich war in der lage aus den drei trainingsstunden heute einen vorteil zu ziehen absolvierte jede menge runden und sammelte viele interessante daten die f r den rest des wochenendes n tzlich sein werden
6814221 ich mag den kurs wirklich es nach dem auto eine menge spa
6814222 das haftungsniveau war schlecht aber wir sind daran bei stra en kursen gew hnt ich werde nun mit meinen ingenieuren daran arbeiten das setup des autos zu optimieren so dass wir morgen fr h eine gute letzte trainingseinheit haben k nnen und das qualifying in guter form angehen
6814223 es war interessant gewesen diesen neuen kurs zu lernen und sich daran anzupassen
6814224 w hrend der heutigen trainingseinheiten arbeiteten wir uns durch unser programm um etwas ber den kurs das auto und die reifen zu lernen
6814225 wie erwartet war die haftung zu beginn sehr gering und verbesserte sich im lauf der beiden einheiten es f llt schwer etwas ber unsere situation in relation zu den anderen zu wissen aber wir hatten keine signifikanten probleme was im hinblick auf den rest des wochenendes ermutigend ist
6814226 wir haben heute eine gro e distanz zur ckgelegt was das ziel war denn die priorit t lag darauf das maximum aus der zur verf gung stehenden zeit auf der strecke zu machen
6814227 wir mussten so viele informationen und daten wie m glich sammeln um das auto zu verbessern und f r die qualifying einheit morgen ger stet zu sein
6814228 in bezug auf den motor konzentrierten wir uns haupts chlich darauf die getriebe bersetzung zu optimieren nun m ssen wir auf das letzte training morgen fr h warten um ein besseres verst ndnis unserer relativen leistung zu haben alles in allem war der heutige tag problemlos und ermutigend

6814366 when we got up to eight or nine in the later part of july thats when we started asking health units could you go back and get us some more information

6814377 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa but despite all that juelz says he still has love for cam i have no hard feelings towards cam i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up

6814459 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6814460 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6814461 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6814462 over the past ten years i have seen more and more business leaders make the connection between human rights and the success of their companies never before has the private sector had such influence and therefore so much opportunity to contribute to human rights
6814463 we are not so far away from life that we dont understand and get it
6814464 i have not been to britain i dont know much about britain but if they make cars like that there and in those days we did then britain must be a wonderful place
6814465 and i do wish i could get them long enough to look nice
6814466 dogs show a strong aversion to inequity i would prefer not to call it a sense of fairness but others might
6814467 we need a special holiday to honor the countless kind souls with unsecured networks named linksys
6814468 i dont have any pain really ive just got a bloody nose and obviously the swelling beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6814469 i can see out of my right eye when i open it its just easier right now to keep it closed
6814470 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
6814471 the one thing i cant do laura and ill talk about anything you want to but the process that were in
6814472 i cant talk about it because if i do i would get down a slippery slope

6814488 there are lots of people who have been waiting for two years for this and they are going to put down the money
6814489 but the numbers are clearly not going to be anywhere near what we could have expected not simply because of the price itself but because there is visibility of price worldwide and this is three times the u s price so you can actually order it off e bay including customs duty so that actually puts quite a dampener on the whole thing

6814519 but russia saw they could go into georgia and we would have no real response except saying please get out i think we have to re engage with russia and not just have george bush watching the volleyball tournament in the olympics while georgias getting invaded that perception is very important and i think he needs to take it a little more seriously

6814527 i used to do bmx when i was a kid so its cool to see this
6814528 but you know that this is nothing compared to skateboarding that should be here
6814529 we knew where we wanted to be and we knew the steps it would take
6814530 freestyle and skateboarding was more like a cult they never could get together
6814531 this is going to be in the olympics one day
6814532 as a 16 year old kid you think you know it all and im just like yeah right what are you smoking
6814533 they of course dreamt about going to the olympics thats for sure
6814534 they realized also that they would never make it it would be much better to be attached to an international federation recognized already by the ioc
6814535 the problem with skateboarding is that skateboarding is not organized
6814536 we were the only discipline that had our act together
6814537 not that our ratings were high but we had all of the pieces that they needed
6814538 theres a place you have to do it theres uniforms theres rules skateboarding had no rules i could do it whenever i want wherever i want and however i want
6814539 when you say organization you bring on adults and typically bring on old adults
6814540 a young relevant sport managed by old adults is a tough sell they usually do more harm than good
6814541 it helps to answer a perplexing question how can there be gay genes given that gay sex doesnt lead to procreation

6814543 so this girl i used to date was telling me how great it is for her to have a gay brother which is even better than a best gay boyfriend do you have any gay relatives

6814549 if god had wanted man to play soccer he wouldnt have given us arms
6814550 it is the great misperception of our time that what we observe in our world controls how we feel and think in the next level of human evolution we will take as common knowledge that we have 100 control over our life experience we choose and manifest everything that happens to us in our life and our inner world dictates our outer world and not the other way around
6814551 see if you can catch yourself complaining in either speech or thought about a situation you find yourself in what other people do or say your surroundings your life situation even the weather to complain is always nonacceptance of what is it invariably carries an unconscious negative charge when you complain you make yourself a victim leave the situation or accept it all else is madness

6814560 aku melihat allah telah menyiratkan dan memberikan cahaya di hatimu wahai anakku janganlah engkau padamkan cahaya itu dengan maksiat
6814561 jika kegersangan hatimu akibat dosa dosa maka tinggalkanlah perbuatan dosa itu dalam hati kita tak ada perkara yang lebih pahit daripada kegersangan dosa di atas dosa

6814564 dan barangsiapa yang dihinakan allah maka tidak seorang pun yang memuliakannya sesungguhnya allah berbuat apa yang dia kehendaki
6814565 barang siapa yang menghendaki kemuliaan maka bagi allah lah kemuliaan itu

6814570 dan janganlah kamu seperti orang orang yang lupa kepada allah lalu allah menjadikan mereka lupa kepada diri mereka sendiri mereka itulah orang orang yang fasik
6814571 dan apa saja musibah yang menimpa kamu maka adalah disebabkan oleh perbuatan tanganmu sendiri dan allah memaafkan sebagian besar dari kesalahan kesalahanmu

6814600 a true alpha has no fear of his environment and has complete control of events around him and thus announces his elevated status by assuming nonverbal gestures and stances that could potentially make him more vulnerable to usurpers
6814601 leader of men whether he was born with this skill or learned it he could lead men men regardless of whether they liked him respected him they could be found on the battlefield offices kitchens i e chefs etc very very often this ability had absolutely no translation to the bedroom it had little effect on whether he would bed all or any of the hot babes

6814607 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6814608 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6814609 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6814610 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6814611 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6814612 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6814613 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6814614 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6814615 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6814616 the people who still call the shots are of one race

6814633 no need herr stellen since you are so proficient with english
6814634 klaffenbach i think then when we were overran all of us were told to run as well as we could my commanding officer gave me my pay for the next six months since there soon wouldnt be much chances for getting it paid and i started walking
6814635 i didnt even get new clothes then when i see you americans at the top of a hill i suddenly remember im in a ss uniform so i run and of course you notice me i rush into this old mine opening and disclothe myself get out of my clothes and throw them down a shaft then i run out naked and clothesless and then you notice and catch me i told i was a civilian robbed by ss men but ah they wont believe
6814636 you hardly can blame them for that herr stellen they saw you running into that mine
6814637 oh they didnt they didnt i was running from ones that came from from the road and the ones that caught me were coming from the very opposite direction those that first saw me wouldnt have caught me but you were everywhere
6814638 ah and to return to your posting at klaffenbach who were your superiors in that post
6814639 i ive always been a healthy man ive never been sick i dont know only followed orders never asked names
6814640 how about the name of your own commanding officer surely you remember that
6814641 indeed a formidable post your garrison must have been sizeable enough what was its function
6814642 it wasnt a prison camp an extermination camp a killing camp
6814643 would you care to tell me where that klaffenbach camp is exactly located
6814644 located i i you must have misheard me ive never even heard that name i was in landshut yes the wehrmacht garrison there the ss section there was called klaffenbach after our commanding officer
6814645 did i i meant i dont klaffenbach was his nickname i dont know i dont remember his real name
6814646 to west of course i wanted to surrender to you americans
6814647 so why were you caught fifty kilometres east of landshut
6814648 i was oh of course i wasnt in landshut at that time i was in kaltbach it is a small village in a public meeting after it ended i was told to run
6814649 give no he just told me to run since the war was lost there wasnt any time
6814650 but you just said he paid you your six months salary
6814651 oh i forgot that was the money i had with me i shall be wanting it back its legally mine
6814652 well decide that later for now it seems to me that well have to keep you in detention for a time herr stellen until weve got some confirmation on the things you have told me
6814653 confirmation you cant you must not the entire garrison must have been killed in battle theres hardly anybody left i wasnt stationed there for long they may not even remember me and we burned all of our records there isnt anything left to tell i was there you must believe me
6814654 indeed and would you want to elaborate on where you were assigned before you were transferred to landshut
6814655 in fact we have this confession from another ss man who saw you in m nich in the summer of 44 you told him rather interesting things on the place you were assigned to
6814656 i didnt no i mean i was drunk very drunk i must have talked talked air nothing drunken stupidity boasts
6814657 i dont recall meeting him he must be lying i demand to know his name
6814658 you are hardly in a position to make any demands herr stellen were you stationed to a concentration camp named klaffenbach in the summer of 1944
6814659 where is this camp klaffenbach located who was its commanding officer
6814660 you should co operate it will make things much easier
6814661 i will tell i will tell everything but you must believe me nobody ever will we were there and we hardly believed what
6814662 begin from the beginning who was the commanding officer of the camp
6814663 ss gruppenf hrer horst doktor opfel ran the medical half he was a ss brigadef hrer he he did it all he and his helpers we didnt do it we only looked we were soldiers we had orders
6814664 we lost half of our guards because of selbstmord the killed themselves because they could listen at it any more
6814665 we couldnt listen to the things doktor did they kept they kept speaking i escaped because i couldnt take it anymore they kept speaking
6814666 i cant we dont know where that camp is we havent found it its somewhere here in southern germany but we havent found it
6814667 maybe it was dismantled or something we dont know anything about it except the name and now the only man that we had that was in there is dead

6814676 indian women who are physically and sexually abused by their husbands are four times more likely to have hiv than other wives aids prevention should focus more on mistreatment of women indias aids epidemic is the third largest of any country in the world and infections among women are rising health officials should target wives who are forced to have unsafe sex along with their husbands for preventive measures said study author jay silverman an associate professor of society human development and health at the harvard school of public health in boston sexual abuse of adolescent girls and women is driving the hiv epidemic in india and around the world we need to make it a major priority for prevention the findings echo a 2004 study of women in south africa where abused women were 50 percent more likely to be hiv infected than non abused women regardless of their own behavior in many settings womens risk of hiv is largely driven by the behavior of their male partners said kristin dunkle an assistant professor of behavioral sciences and health education at the emory center for aids research in atlanta about 0 73 percent of women who had been physically and sexually abused were infected compared with 0 19 percent among non abused women almost all the women 95 percent reported that they had no extramarital sexual relations themselves that points to known patterns in the behavior of abusive husbands that puts their wives and children at higher risk of hiv infection sexually abusive husbands may force their wives to have intercourse without condoms or unprotected anal sex both of which can significantly increase hiv infection risk the men may also be having risky sex with women outside the marriage increasing their own chance of infection we have to get to the men silverman said and we have to provide women with reasonable alternatives if theyre being abused so they can maintain their children and not become destitute to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives said donta balaiah of the indian council of medical research who helped write the study the study was supported by the u s national institute of child health and human development in bethesda maryland and the indian council of medical research in new delhi which funds and promotes research in the country
6814677 despite a lower prevalence of infection among indias general population women account for a rising percentage of hiv cases married indian women who experienced both physical and sexual intimate partner violence demonstrated an hiv infection prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women the risky sexual behaviour of husbands was the major source of womens infection they suggested that doctors and public health officials focus on preventing intimate partner violence to help reduce the spread of hiv aids
6814678 indias aids epidemic is the third largest of any country in the world
6814679 indias hiv aids affected reduced to half in revised figures
6814680 despite recent reductions in hiv prevalence among both the general population and many high risk groups the percentage of all infections occurring among indian women currently estimated at 39 has continued to rise relative to that among men
6814681 recognized as the source of increasing hiv prevalence among its south asian neighbors
6814682 womens risk of hiv is largely driven by the behavior of their male partners

6814731 about two weeks later the same thing happened again except it was a different person of about the same age 19 or 20 year old
6814732 i asked in the village about these two but no one had seen them heres my theory what better place for a history student to study history than to walk the road through its various eras not to talk to anyone not to be seen just to walk the road to see conditions at various times throughout history could these have been time travelers on a history assignment
6814733 in the early summer of 1968 my daughter and i drove to new mexico to visit some friends who had a small ranch there before going west to meet my husband
6814734 leaving taos we drove to flagstaff and waited there until the early evening to cross the mojave desert at night
6814735 the sky was unusually cloudy and i looked to where she was pointing and saw first two and then three lights moving rapidly in the sky turning at 90 degree angles pulsating and disappearing
6814736 we watched the sky together she in the back seat and i in front when suddenly in front of the car there appeared a huge dark and glowing object with a partial row of lights in the middle
6814737 the next thing i remember is my breath being knocked out of me as i somehow went through the windshield of the car
6814738 i couldnt see my daughter and i asked in terror about her
6814739 these beings were tall about six and a half feet their skin was silvery
6814740 i had a feeling of love or long lost family it was almost like a homecoming
6814741 then they took me to a room that contained the ships driving mechanism in front of me was a huge crystal perhaps three feet across in the middle it looked like two pyramids placed base to base although at times it seemed multifaceted and totally brilliant and jewel like suspended in the air they told me to put my mind into the crystal and as i did id be able to learn how to fly the ship
6814742 as we moved to the exit they said my name again several times and something about soul lineage
6814743 i had a notebook in the car and before we left i forced myself to write these things down as i remembered them
6814744 i drove on to california then as if nothing had happened
6814745 one night my daughter woke up screaming and i went to her bed and she said very factually mommy im going to die
6814746 i drove back to texas and put her in the hospital there only to find out that she had a very rare cancer of the nervous system neuroblastoma and it had metastasized and she had just a few months to live
6814747 before her death she began to draw extraordinary pictures that were compared to those of a ten year old even though she was only three and a half
6814748 the day after her funeral a friend of mine who was a graduate student at the university of texas called me from austin in hysterics saying that she had to drive to houston immediately and tell me something that had happened
6814749 without glasses she was legally blind but she drove anyway
6814750 we went for pizza and she told me what had happened
6814751 two tall beings appeared and in between them was my daughter they told her they hadnt been able to get through to me because of something but to let me know that my daughter was okay and was with them she thought that shed gone completely insane at that point in her story i broke my promise to myself and told her what had happened that night in the desert and we both cried and cried
6814752 separatists opened fire in response to yesterdays peaceful initiative of the president of georgia as a result lives of civilians were under threat

6814754 look reverse all of this paper work right now i have to take that phone home and just keep trying to reboot it over and over again until i can get to that screen again it literally took me two days of solid shutting down and booting up over and over again and playing with buttons that might force the phone to stop freezing instead of starting up and you just ignored me when i asked you not to take the battery out
6814755 well get it back to me in two days or we cant replace your phone

6814804 if she really wants to show that she knows how to handle a rifle theres an easy way to do that meet me in the woods
6814805 this is the same person who spent a decade with her husband campaigning for nafta and now goes around saying shes opposed to nafta
6814806 it is time for change but the right kind of change change that trusts in the strength of free people and free markets change that doesnt return to policies that empower government to make our choices for us but that works to ensure that we have choices to make for ourselves

6814808 in a break with his party and president bush senator mccain is throwing his support behind a federal law that aims to protect a journalists right to conceal confidential sources from the courts the presumptive republican nominee announced his position on the free flow of information act or federal shield law yesterday at the annual meeting of the associated press
6814809 look i know something about long odds they had me written off last summer
6814810 i just thought it was too tilted to the wealthy and i still do
6814811 mccain not only persisted in his dishonest claim that mitt romney supported a timetable for withdrawing from iraq he used one evasion after another to try to make it stick
6814812 after more than 50 failures and almost 50 years the united states senate is finally poised to again produce a president with the democratic race for the nomination reduced to a two senator battle between hillary rodham clinton and barack obama and senator john mccain tightening his grip on the republican nod it is becoming more likely that a member of the current senate will do something no other senator has done since 1961 move straight from congress to the white house of course it is taking the prospect of the first ever white house race between two sitting senators to guarantee that outcome given the senates record as a political ball and chain for presidential contenders of both parties perhaps the only route from the senate to the executive mansion is over another senator
6814813 you know we have soldiers overseas now who are getting shot at by real bullets from real enemies who really want to kill them getting shot at by snipers is not something you forget or make light of
6814814 it bothers me any time anyone running for the highest office in the land fabricates a story that should bother any american whether youre military or nonmilitary
6814815 there was no greeting ceremony and we were basically told to run to our cars now that is what happened
6814816 what kind of president would say hey man i cant go cause i might get shot so im going to send my wife
6814817 even some clinton loyalists are wondering aloud if the win at all costs strategy of hillary and bill which continued tuesday when hillary tried to drag rev

6814822 unlike other modern revivals such as the camaro challenger or even fords own mustang the capri is destined to have a futuristic rather than a throw back design ethic the visos concept is a suitable template though even that design would likely face serious updates before going to market

6814824 general david petraeus has a sterling reputation the love of the press and the adoration of the gop dont be surprised if a democratic presidential win in 08 starts an effort to recruit petraeus as the republican candidate in 12
6814825 john mccains team that is taking over the republican party has decided on bobbie greene
6814826 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
6814827 but not until congress and the administration have a better understanding of the costs of war and peace
6814828 i just thought it was too tilted to the wealthy and i still do
6814829 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6814830 if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all
6814831 who still have most of your fingers and know how to hold a pen to send us actual tangible letters
6814832 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
6814833 when i urged the president of the united states not to rule out the option of ground forces then i also assumed responsibility for what may be the loss of young americans lives
6814834 i dont know how it affects my campaign but ive basically put my campaign on hold to some degree
6814835 we all grieve over civilian casualties as well as our own losses
6814836 the cause and manner of death has not been determined
6814837 one agent deployed pepper spray and he continued to resist
6814838 i want to ask authorities to conduct a deep thorough and independent investigation of my brothers death
6814839 we dont know of anybody else whos looking at this
6814840 when they said he died on july 8 i didnt believe it because we had been in a chat room that day
6814841 call him barack obama for hes got the luck of the irish

6814845 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
6814846 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero

6814849 they know they need that kind of lobbying help and they went after people who could deliver
6814850 first the times muddied with unsubstantiated sexual innuendo about a female lobbyist a story about mccains flights on jets owned by corporations with business before the senate commerce committee and his meeting with a broadcaster mccain at first denied it happened the broadcaster insists it did and mccain now agrees who sought and received mccains help in pressuring the federal communications commission
6814851 youre a bully and a coward you have no regard for the constitution ill be civil to you but i wont shake your hand
6814852 i just thought it was too tilted to the wealthy and i still do
6814853 mcqueeg has a clear runway and still cant carry the ball what he should have said is that since kerry is a senator and mcqueeg is a senator we have met many times so then if asked about being kerrys running mate he should have told the reporter i guess kerry came to me looking for a few good men he should have done it with humor and a pleasant temperament and turned it back on the nyt but he cant do it since he knows he really doesnt belong where he is mcqueeg should be having the time of his life now like reagan did when he campaigned for potus but hes going to make it a struggle what a shame
6814854 confronted with his lie on wednesday nights debate mccain blustered and filibustered in a manner reminiscent of captain queeg in the caine mutiny when he was caught in a lie during a navy inquiry
6814855 i do want to emphasize again that the three of us are going as members of the armed services committee mr
6814856 and we will emphasize that at every stop clintonian to try to call a political trip with lavish fundraising events not a political trip the regretful nominee
6814857 top mccain advisers lobbied for airbus contract was altered last year
6814858 theres no way i lost 15 0 i hit him with clean shots the way the judging is out here it should be the judges being drug tested not the fighters
6814859 samuel peter is an exceptionally dangerous puncher who has already beaten some worthy opponents
6814860 i know that it will be a very tough fight i will reach my dream of winning the world championship for the third time and being champion at the same time with my brother
6814861 for me there is no doubt at all i will defend my title
6814862 id like to think there are goals in this game and im sure mark would say the same
6814863 both of us have lost a striker over the summer but weve made moves to replace them
6814864 ive brought in three players who i consider to be top quality strikers
6814865 mark has been able to bring in john sutton as well as a couple of younger lads so even though hes different to what ross mccormack brought them theyve still got good quality up front
6814866 david clarkson is now a scotland international and chris porter is a really really good striker so weve both got plenty of attacking options
6814867 last season there wasnt too much between the sides it was a good fight right to the end for third place and both of us will be hoping its the same again this season
6814868 motherwell havent got off to the start they would have wanted and neither did we so it has been kind of the same for both of us
6814869 i was pleased with the way we played against celtic last weekend and want more of the same while i think motherwell have been unlucky so far
6814870 good contacts in holland had alerted to me to the fact that glenn was on the lookout for a club where he could play regular football
6814871 he was just coming through the ranks at feyenoord and wanted to play regularly and i was desperate to get him to falkirk
6814872 the scouting reports were excellent and contacts in holland also recommended him as a very strong character with a bright future
6814873 it wasnt pie in the sky stuff either when we contacted glenn he was interested in what we were prepared to offer him
6814874 he actually travelled to scotland with his agent and we had a talk about what i was trying to do at falkirk and what sort of platform we could offer him at his stage in his development
6814875 in talks with his agent it became quite clear that he would have commanded a wage far in excess of what we could afford
6814876 i love eating and gaming and i support green projects which is why i am working under the moniker rawmethod i love working with my hands but due to the market requirements nowadays i picked up 3d and other software applications my goal is to become someone who starts a new trend in art and ultimately makes a career out of it

6814882 i was a real bigot when it came to china i had a lot of prejudices that i had to leave behind when i came to this place
6814883 i had to learn that they have their way and their political philosophy i respect that

6814886 this year we saw a 3 19 growth in the number of press conferences and a 3 78 increase in the number of attendants
6814887 given that the chinese government has lied through its teeth
6814888 the western media was clamoring for a comment the people who could comment were out of town their instinct was that you had to get everybody together to analyze what had happened
6814889 i think the chinese learned a lot from experiences like spielberg about how fast the news cycle is
6814890 perlmutter also introduced the companys second generation dual core mobile processors for increasingly popular ultra thin and light notebook pcs
6814891 time is short economy is collapsing we are strong because we are many we will take what we want
6814892 a lot of people responded to the ad initially and wanted to audition
6814893 i pointed them towards the most difficult radiohead songs and said can you play this this weeded out a lot of players but the ones who stuck with it are the ones who are in the band today
6814894 and there are only so many to win if theyre winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
6814895 we know some nations devoted significantly more resources in these games
6814896 they have a lot more money to spend on sports now
6814897 in the future and in these games theyre clearly full of resources and effort in every single sport but well have to redouble our efforts
6814898 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
6814899 here at radio caracas television they practice yellow journalism treacherous journalism that goes against the peoples rights
6814900 never has a living mortal never has a mere human being won so many olympic medals

6814903 we visited the classrooms and centers used in the literacy campaign in venezuela
6814904 venezuela is the first and only country to meet the commitments adopted by the regions governments in 2002 in havana to drastically reduce illiteracy
6814905 airfield in senaki is also part of the zone of responsibility of the russian peacekeepers
6814906 our forces will be pulled back to these zones of responsibility today

6814911 lo de siempre hay que darle m s ca a al tema
6814912 la clave ha estado en el cansancio estamos muertos no mentalmente sino f sicamente
6814913 eso pasa en muchos partidos que se escape el contrario en el marcador luego hemos empatado no marca el partido pero se notaba que ellos hab an salido como aviones y han acabado como aviones
6814914 la ilusi n de ganar la medalla todav a est ah y vamos a tratar de lucharlo como podamos el que se recupere antes de croacia o nosotros creo que se llevar el gato al agua
6814915 s creo que hemos perdido la oportunidad de nuestra vida y despu s de con corea y con islandia era mejor en el otro grupo que eran bicampeones del mundo y de europa y de todo han sido los cruces m s f ciles que pod amos tener en muchos a os ha habido un baj n f sico muy grande muy grande en comparaci n con ellos nos tenemos que comparar con el rival y al final se han llevado el gato al agua
6814916 han sido mejores que nosotros y tenemos que recuperar an mica y f sicamente para el partido del domingo
6814917 no s por qu es tan irregular este equipo nos ha faltado la contundencia que tuvimos contra corea
6814918 el d a que estamos bien nos venimos arriba y el d a que estamos mal vamos para abajo en picado no sabemos poner freno a las situaciones y no podemos recibir 36 goles
6814919 hemos estado todo el partido a remolque aunque la diferencia era poca ellos estaban llevando el partido y no hemos dado la sensaci n de poder engancharlo
6814920 hemos perdonado a islandia no puede ser que en un partido as t metas 30 goles y el contrario te meta 36 o que concedas cinco goles nada m s empezar eso ha condicionado todo
6814921 hemos jugado mal tanto en defensa como en ataque hemos entrado tarde al partido como nos ha pasado otras veces y despu s hemos tenido que ir a remolque
6814922 ahora s lo hay que pensar en conseguir la medalla de bronce hemos venido aqu a por una medalla y nos queda el domingo la de bronce a n podemos ganar esa medalla hay que saber competir y pelearlo

6814941 ellos han estado muy acertados y han jugado un buen partido pero bueno hemos sabido ajustar muy bien la defensa y forzarles a hacer peores tiros
6814942 hay que disfrutrar no s si volver a vivir esto
6814943 da igual tener diecisiete que veintiocho a os hay muchos jugadores que nunca tienen esta oportunidad esto hay que disfrutarlo porque yo no s si volver a jugar una final ol mpica

6814950 despu s de tanto tiempo parado es dif cil estar al 100 por 100
6814951 trato de volver a la normalidad de ser un jugador normal y dentro de eso hay entradas faltas y de todo poquito a poco voy consigui ndolo y en ese sentido me voy encontrando mejor
6814952 estoy bien y estoy muy contento por las sensaciones pero despu s de tanto tiempo parado es dif cil estar al cien por cien aunque poquito a poco me voy encontrando mejor me faltan algunas cosas pero soy optimista
6814953 me faltan cosas f sicamente ritmo precisi n tengo que ir poquito a poco y tratando de hacer las cosas lo mejor posible
6814954 trato de volver a la normalidad de ser un jugador normal y dentro de eso hay entradas faltas y de todo poquito a poco voy consigui ndolo y en ese sentido me voy encontrando mejor
6814955 intento siempre estar tranquilo y todo el cari o que la gente me da o las palabras y elogios que recibo me las tomo para bien para seguir con ilusi n pero trato siempre de jugar a mi manera porque intentar hacer m s de lo que uno puede ser a un error intento estar equilibrado y hacer un f tbol que se productivo
6814956 tenemos dos partidos la semana que viene muy importantes y exigentes y vamos a ver si somos capaces de sacarlos adelante el primero es un partido complicado en un campo dif cil y tenemos que ser lo suficientemente competitivos como para ganar el partido
6814957 sab amos que el hajduk iba a ser un equipo complicado por su experiencia en europa y por su motivaci n en riazor no fuimos capaces de hacer gol y a ver si all van las cosas mejor

6814993 we understand their concerns and its clear they are relying on walmart more than ever weve been our customers advocate for more than 40 years and this new advertising campaign reinforces that we will continue to be there for them
6814994 good contacts in holland had alerted to me to the fact that glenn was on the lookout for a club where he could play regular football
6814995 he was just coming through the ranks at feyenoord and wanted to play regularly and i was desperate to get him to falkirk
6814996 the scouting reports were excellent and contacts in holland also recommended him as a very strong character with a bright future
6814997 it wasnt pie in the sky stuff either when we contacted glenn he was interested in what we were prepared to offer him
6814998 he actually travelled to scotland with his agent and we had a talk about what i was trying to do at falkirk and what sort of platform we could offer him at his stage in his development
6814999 in talks with his agent it became quite clear that he would have commanded a wage far in excess of what we could afford
6815000 todas las milicias locales fueron echadas de la ciudad que ahora est bajo control de los islamistas
6815001 la jerarqu a eclesi stica ha de quitarse de la cabeza que es ella quien da licencias de moralidad
6815002 boyd was there in the squad david clarkson was there stephen fletcher and they are all good young strikers
6815003 boyds record at club record is very good there is a role there but james mcfadden and kenny miller are experienced players and james has an excellent goalscoring ratio and kenny does step up to the plate at internationals and his pace through the middle extends the team gives you depth and links the team
6815004 so he boyd is going to have to go some to get into the team
6815005 kris boyd cannot get fit i thought this summer kris boyd was going to be the new slimmed down kris boyd i mean his scoring record in modern terms is phenomenal its something like 75 in 110 games for rangers and for scotland i think it is something like eight in 14 but the guy cannot get fit
6815006 ive argued the case for kris boyd if youve scored 75 goals in 110 games for rangers then you would argue that your club manager should build your team around that potent weapon
6815007 but paul le guen looked at him and said he cant do it and walter smith has looked at him and to be blunt about it has said no hes not a priority for the team
6815008 now hes got this record why do these managers not use him and hes come back after the summer and he does not look 100 percent fit
6815009 samuel peter is an exceptionally dangerous puncher who has already beaten some worthy opponents
6815010 i know that it will be a very tough fight i will reach my dream of winning the world championship for the third time and being champion at the same time with my brother
6815011 for me there is no doubt at all i will defend my title
6815012 id like to think there are goals in this game and im sure mark would say the same
6815013 both of us have lost a striker over the summer but weve made moves to replace them
6815014 ive brought in three players who i consider to be top quality strikers
6815015 mark has been able to bring in john sutton as well as a couple of younger lads so even though hes different to what ross mccormack brought them theyve still got good quality up front
6815016 david clarkson is now a scotland international and chris porter is a really really good striker so weve both got plenty of attacking options
6815017 last season there wasnt too much between the sides it was a good fight right to the end for third place and both of us will be hoping its the same again this season
6815018 motherwell havent got off to the start they would have wanted and neither did we so it has been kind of the same for both of us
6815019 i was pleased with the way we played against celtic last weekend and want more of the same while i think motherwell have been unlucky so far

6815024 that plane is not taking off its eating up the runway
6815025 as it swerved its left wing touched the ground there was an explosion and the plane broke apart
6815026 my mother called him and said that he should get off but my father said they would not let him

6815032 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6815033 but if youre like me and youve got one house you might have a different perspective
6815034 it would be great to see people cheering us along
6815035 when the idea of the convoy to commemorate the life of colin was born we never dreamt 1300 subarus would be taking part we even have subarus joining us from all over europe from poland and the ukraine to france and spain while some fans are flying in especially from australia and argentina to be part of this memorable occasion

6815038 8 15 2008 indonesia commits to stop deforestation amsterdam the indonesian province of riau has pledged to halt the destruction of its forests and peatlands a move that will prevent billions of tonnes of carbon from entering the atmosphere at a ceremony in the provincial capital pekanbaru riau governor wan abu bakar announced the temporary ban which will remain in place until a law is agreed the move follows indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyonos pledge at the g 8 summit in july to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation by 50 percent by 2009 indonesia is the worlds 3rd largest global warming polluter mostly due to deforestation in many cases the forests of indonesia are being cut down illegally to make way for palm plantations forest fires in indonesia have been called the single largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world aside from the direct impact a ban on deforestation in indonesia will have on the amount of pollution being dumped into our atmosphere its just nice to see that some of the worlds leaders actually made meaningful commitments to combatting global warming at the g8 summit other commitments made at that summit were not close to being ambitious enough to really tackle the enormity of the climate crisis were facing its just nice to see some progress

6815041 well i had my first pair of decks when i was 15 or i was into hip hop and got my first pair of technics on my 18th birthday i was a breakdancer and i did graffiti when i was going shopping in birmingham buying my hip hop stuff these new records were how i got into house music
6815042 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music
6815043 good contacts in holland had alerted to me to the fact that glenn was on the lookout for a club where he could play regular football
6815044 he was just coming through the ranks at feyenoord and wanted to play regularly and i was desperate to get him to falkirk
6815045 the scouting reports were excellent and contacts in holland also recommended him as a very strong character with a bright future
6815046 it wasnt pie in the sky stuff either when we contacted glenn he was interested in what we were prepared to offer him
6815047 he actually travelled to scotland with his agent and we had a talk about what i was trying to do at falkirk and what sort of platform we could offer him at his stage in his development
6815048 in talks with his agent it became quite clear that he would have commanded a wage far in excess of what we could afford
6815049 theres no way i lost 15 0 i hit him with clean shots the way the judging is out here it should be the judges being drug tested not the fighters
6815050 id like to have strengthened more but were all working within the parameters that we have
6815051 its definitely a possibility because it isnt a negative system
6815052 its really a 4 3 3 that turns into 4 5 1 only when were defending
6815053 andy has worked extremely hard during the time i have been at the club and he has earned his place in the first team
6815054 he played a lot of reserve team fixtures during pre season but he kept his head down and worked his way into the side
6815055 you always look to strengthen and there are another two weeks or so of the window left
6815056 andrew was involved with reading and there were more players involved with that it was a good thing for andrew himself because people have seen him and i myself think andrew can play higher in the premier league
6815057 we have to move players out before we can bring others in
6815058 there are a few who know they have become surplus to requirements their chances of first team football have lessened
6815059 those players are aware of the situation but they have still worked very hard and i have to give credit to them because it isnt easy to know you are training every day without being involved
6815060 if something came in that i thought was right for us and right for him we would listen to it but circumstances in football change and deano can play right back centre back and midfield so he is a valuable member of our squad
6815061 i think there was a tentative enquiry at chairman level from burnley but i have dismissed that it is not the right time
6815062 so unless someone comes in with a mind blowing offer deano will be staying and i am quite happy to keep him
6815063 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6815064 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6815065 it was an important title not because we won it against them but because it was my first trophy here that win gives us confidence for the first liga match it gives us the strength to do good things this season like winning the title

6815135 we experienced a lot of red tape and almost professional obstructionism from chinese authorities in the build up to the games the worst being when we were suddenly told that foreigners would not be allowed access to the building we are now using for our live studio overlooking the birds nest
6815136 that problem was finally overcome but only at the last minute and after a huge amount of effort by our beijing bureau
6815137 our studio then had a few visits from the police threatening to close us down just days before the games began because they suddenly decided we were too close to the stadium another hurdle we had to overcome
6815138 since then weve had nothing more than a few hands put in front of our lenses which is par for the course in china
6815139 we have been continually lied to it has got to the stage where people who ask tough questions of them are not allowed basically ignored when hands go up to ask any more

6815183 las autoridades estadounidenses est n investigando la presunta relaci n de la red cubana de esp as con el derribo de dos avionetas de la organizaci n del exilio hermanos al rescate ocurrida en 1996

6815186 s a veces hemos enviado ciudadanos cubanos que se han infiltrado en organizaciones contrarrevolucionarias para informar de actividades destructivas contra nuestra patria y creo que tenemos derecho a hacerlo mientras estados unidos tolere que desde all se organicen sabotajes incursiones armadas ametrallamiento de instalaciones tur sticas introducci n de armas explosivos y sobre todo brutales atentados terroristas
6815187 en nuestros d as de prisi n hemos reflexionado sobre nuestra conducta en este pa s y reafirmamos la m s profunda convicci n de que con nuestra actitud y acciones no transgredimos ni pusimos en peligro la seguridad del pueblo norteamericano y s contribuimos en alguna medida a descubrir planes y acciones terroristas contra nuestro pueblo evitando la muerte de ciudadanos inocentes cubanos y norteamericanos
6815188 esta es una unidad para presos que est n castigados o sea m s castigados de lo normal o para casos muy peligrosos o de extrema seguridad para el caso es lo mismo porque a uno lo tienen bajo el mismo r gimen no importa si est s castigado o si te tienen all por razones de seguridad all nos tuvieron 17 meses que no es un r cord pero es muy buen average
6815189 pero menos cantidad porque las bandejas en el hueco son m s chiquitas
6815190 solo nos sacaban una hora al d a a recreaci n d as entre semana si no llov a si no tronaba y si no era feriado la recreaci n consiste en llevarte a otra celda m s grande que tiene un pedazo de malla en una parte del techo por donde entra aire de la calle all puedes recrearte todo lo que quieras corriendo o caminando porque no hay nada m s que hacer
6815191 all ten an personas con graves problemas de conducta cada uno solo y en ropa interior
6815192 en esas condiciones pensaban mantenernos por lo menos un a o y fue gracias a las protestas y manifestaciones de solidaridad de muchos compa eros que solo estuvimos un mes durante ese tiempo no me permitieron tener nada de leer despu s de mucho pedirlo me dieron unas hojas de papel y un repuesto de pluma para escribir a mi abogado el sobre lo tuve que fabricar con ese mismo papel y pegarlo con pasta dental
6815193 cuando nos enteramos de que los hab an metido de nuevo en el hueco del 28 de febrero al 30 de marzo del 2003 nos impresion much simo
6815194 lo interrumpieron y lo sacaron de entre sus alumnos sin explicaci n
6815195 solo con su ropa interior en momentos en que todav a era temporada invernal
6815196 gerardo estuvo solicitando asistencia m dica durante casi los 30 d as del hueco porque le ca an las aguas alba ales del piso de arriba sobre su rostro l ten a el temor de dormirse pidi que taparan ese orificio y jam s fue atendido esa fue una de las situaciones adem s de la extrema soledad el aislamiento y la presi n sobre ellos que puso en alerta al movimiento de solidaridad en el mundo porque adem s los mandaron al hueco en el preciso instante en que se preparaban para presentar sus documentos de apelaci n la orden de impedir que pudieran trabajar con sus abogados fue enviada desde washington
6815197 los cinco son hombres valientes eso es cierto pero hay otros presos valientes ni porque tienen una buena familia porque tambi n hay otros presos que tienen buenas familias el asunto de este tema es que los cinco son inocentes no porque sean valientes ni porque tengan familias sino porque son personas que tienen derecho a la libertad porque se les han violado todos sus derechos en un proceso penal
6815198 fue una etapa bastante dura no solo por las condiciones sino porque coincidi que eran los primeros meses
6815199 de todos modos como dec a gustavo adolfo b cquer eso no es pedo que moje calzoncillos y en un par de meses ya le hab amos cogido la vuelta al hueco
6815200 el hueco tambi n fue una escuela aprendimos mucho de nosotros mismos y de los dem s del honor y de la dignidad humana
6815201 este proceso ser mucho m s interesante que cualquier programa de televisi n
6815202 en toda causa criminal el acusado gozar del derecho de ser juzgado r pidamente y en p blico por un jurado imparcial del distrito y estado en el que el delito se haya cometido distrito que deber haber sido determinado previamente por la ley as como de que se le haga saber la naturaleza y causa de la acusaci n de que se le caree con los testigos que depongan en su contra de que se obligue a comparecer a los testigos que le favorezcan y de contar con la ayuda de un abogado que le defienda
6815203 quiere esto decir que para la jueza aquella turba que quemaba banderas y neum ticos en las calles que da aba autom viles que alteraba el orden p blico desafiando a la polic a que profer a amenazas que portaba armas ilegalmente que incumpli la orden de devoluci n del ni o eli n en franco desacato a la autoridad en un desesperado intento por mantenerlo secuestrado aquella turba que logr poner en jaque a la ciudad durante varios meses no ten a nada que ver con el juicio no influir a en los posibles jurados
6815204 no le creer a a ning n agente proveniente de cuba
6815205 creo que castro es un dictador comunista y yo me opongo al comunismo
6815206 estoy fuertemente opuesta al comunismo la pol tica de estados unidos hacia cuba es justa
6815207 una especie de postigo que nos diera acceso a la interioridad de aquellos hombres que se enfrentaban a la eventualidad de tener que actuar como jurados en un caso de supuestos agentes cubanos qued abierto cuando algunos tuvieron al menos el valor de expresar sus temores en las ruedas de preguntas
6815208 me sentir a un poco intimidado y quiz s un poco temeroso por mi propia seguridad si no regreso con un veredicto que est en concordancia con lo que la comunidad cubana siente como ellos deber an sentir el veredicto
6815209 si deseas saber la verdad yo sufrir a un ataque de nervios
6815210 creo que s tengo alg n miedo por mi propia seguridad si no regreso con un veredicto en concordancia con toda la comunidad cubana
6815211 estar a preocupado ante la reacci n que podr a tener lugar
6815212 creo que muchas personas son de extrema derecha hay tantos fascistas por aqu
6815213 el miedo a una reacci n violenta por parte del exilio cubano si un jurado decide absolver a cinco hombres acusados de espiar para el r gimen de la isla ha llevado a muchos potenciales candidatos a pedir a la jueza que los excuse del deber c vico
6815214 el juicio seguido contra los cinco es una de esas causas extraordinarias en que est en juego de modo particular la credibilidad en la supuesta lucha antiterrorista que ha proclamado estados unidos y los fundamentos mismos de la legalidad norteamericana
6815215 durante nuestro juicio llegamos a pensar que los fiscales tendr an una oficina dedicada solo a preparar trampas y a manipular el sistema
6815216 era una persona normal buen trabajador y sociable que no mostr inter s particular alguno por las reas de seguridad
6815217 los fiscales preparan minuciosamente a sus testigos para mentir con la misma impunidad con que lo hacen ellos mismos
6815218 otro ejemplo que me viene a la mente en nuestro caso los fiscales me quer an achacar la autor a de una carta que sencillamente no hab a escrito yo y seg n las pruebas de laboratorio del propio fbi la impresi n de mi computadora no se correspond a con la de la carta
6815219 pues bien el fiscal se par en sus argumentos finales y dijo que eso no importaba que la carta la hab a hecho yo con mi computadora y que de todas nuestras computadoras ocupadas por ellos la m a era la nica que pod a haberlo hecho
6815220 lo peor es que durante el juicio nadie se hab a molestado en presentar evidencia en relaci n con nuestros tipos de computadoras el asunto sencillamente no se hab a abordado en todo el juicio y todo lo que hab a era un peritaje del fbi desechando mi computadora como fuente de la carta
6815221 pero eso no import el se or simplemente se par ante el jurado y le envi un mensaje la evidencia del fbi dice una cosa pero yo que soy el fiscal les estoy diciendo ahora el tipo ten a la m s absoluta seguridad de que su sola palabra anular a ni m s ni menos que un peritaje del fbi

6815236 tens of thousands of patients were studied for as long as 5 years for the vaccine thats on the market so its as well studied as any other vaccine thats been released
6815237 i dont think theres any cause for alarm whatsoever i still get reports daily that people dont see because were still doing studies now and there is nothing that has crossed my desk that makes me worried whatsoever
6815238 theyre always finding something wrong with something you know everything they put on the market a year or two down the road theyre going to find something wrong with it so i just havent paid any attention to it i told her to go on and get it and she got it and im glad she did

6815249 were asking the jury to consider a couple of weeks of testimony and over 4 000 documents gathered during years of investigation and reach a decision but we know the jurors were very attentive and respectful of the process and we appreciate any outcome
6815250 the whole reason for the regional center ordinance is to make sure that we have quality development in the downtown area that is consistent
6815251 we want to know whats going on in the building
6815252 the mold has been in this building for years thats my opinion i cant prove it
6815253 when the roof blew off two years ago its been worse
6815254 we as commissioners recommended quite some time ago that we build a new courthouse and the council said no

6815262 ten or 12 years ago when people like barry and i would tell people that we are goat farmers they would laugh in our faces but now when we tell them that they get interested
6815263 i worked at ibm and citigroup and retired from both of those and wanted to do something outside i thought id get some exercise and i thought itd be healthy for me
6815264 the goats came about because i would sit on my front porch and look at all that stupid kudzu over there i thought it looked ugly and it wasnt doing anything productive
6815265 whats miraculous about kudzu is it is high in protein and goats love it we thought there ought to be some combination of goats and kudzu that would be good for everybody
6815266 all this stuff the kudzu is just growing out here and unless we have a drought like we did last year it will just continue to grow so use it goats are the most efficient forage machines on the earth im convinced of it nothing is better than a goat at converting forage to either milk or meat or fiber
6815267 well thats not the way it is it was kind of that way historically they cattlemen saw the sheepherders as competitors but they are not we sheep and goat farmers can be companions
6815268 herbicide works too but you have to put a lot on there again youve got the expense of the herbicide but youve also got potential environmental impact so here come the goats they go out there eat the stuff process it and turn it into meat and all they leave behind is fertilizer
6815269 the perception in america is changing tremendously and it is changing from the top down thats the amazing thing its the american consumers with the most expendable income that are experimenting with it and liking goat

6815272 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident
6815273 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction
6815274 conservatism was then as it remains now an expression of american business
6815275 this wave of misgovernment has been brought to you by ideology not incompetence

6815282 i dont think the media are really going to get anywhere by camping outside his house but it kind of adds to the excitement
6815283 its sort of a natural curiosity i think theres a drive for every journalist to get a scoop if you happen to be in his driveway and he lets something slip on the phone or gives some indication of whats going on its kind of a fun experience i dont think its an unhealthy excitement its probably healthy and fun
6815284 do i think hes the best choice for vice president yes and no
6815285 he has a lot of clout and exposure in foreign politics
6815286 mrs biden runs around here a lot and the other day we saw mr and mrs biden planting impatiens out here
6815287 my husband and i were joking whether there would be an increase in security in the area if he becomes vice president i dont know how that would work
6815288 every four years people speculate a lot about who is going to be the vp pick
6815289 since the presidential candidates have been locked in for about two months now people and the media want to know whats next around campaigns journalists tend to form packs and share information
6815290 i tell ya put some sand out here and it looks like a beach
6815291 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6815292 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6815293 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6815294 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead

6815340 change a democratic administration would usher in a change of faces certainly and wed hear a rhetorical shift to be sure but no real fundamental sea change in the guiding principles and present direction of policy which amounts to a permanent rationale for a massive overseas projection of us military power
6815341 obama wants thousands more us soldiers sent to the afghan front and certainly our reverses in that theater arent being publicized as widely as the alleged
6815342 thats why the endless framing of every issue in partisan terms is so irrelevant and just plain boring republicans and democrats red state blue state conservative liberal its just a game show albeit often an entertaining one that really decides nothing much of anything

6815344 oh well on the last day of filming it was family day at my kids school and i needed to be there so they put this guy in my place
6815345 as ive said from the beginning the decision would be made on who we feel gives us the best opportunity to win the football game and right now we feel russell wilson will do that
6815346 he will be our starter as we go but we certainly feel that daniel evans has some things he can contribute to this football team as well russell is the starter and daniel is the backup but as daniel knows he is one play away from being the starter
6815347 i believe daniel and i can both step in and help this team win some games the team is really excited to go down to south carolina and we hope it will be a great game

6815362 dr ramakrishnans visionary research on techniques for scaling data mining algorithms to large datasets and on mining ordered and streaming data has significantly influenced ongoing developments in the industry
6815363 i am honored to be recognized with this prestigious award my work has been carried out in close collaboration with many students and colleagues over the years and in accepting this award i represent all of them

6815367 those are friendships which have lasted for years and continue until this day
6815368 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
6815369 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
6815370 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
6815371 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
6815372 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
6815373 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6815374 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory

6815381 im walking in richie richs new line he was from heatherette now hes got a line called um celebut
6815382 and i are the new models for the line so we just shot that a couple days ago and im walking in his show on the 9th
6815383 its a dark circus theme we had circus acts and we had dangling people and the contortionists and the whole circus basically and richie was like the circus master and lydia and i are like the little circus princesses
6815384 i had to dangle from like the trapeze and there are a few topless moments
6815385 we had to move our bodies in a whole bunch of weird ways i really feel like i could join the circus after this shoot
6815386 i mean im in a group too where you just need to go do your own thing for a while thats how life works
6815387 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6815388 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6815389 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6815390 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6815391 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6815392 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6815393 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6815394 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6815395 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6815396 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6815397 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6815398 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6815399 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6815400 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6815401 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6815402 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6815403 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6815404 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6815405 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6815406 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6815407 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6815408 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6815409 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6815410 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6815411 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6815412 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6815413 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6815414 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6815415 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6815416 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6815417 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6815418 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6815419 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6815420 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6815421 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6815422 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6815423 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6815424 it looked to me that the tray is marked has reflective markings on it so i doubt theres going to be anything its just a very very tragic accident
6815425 il mio rapporto con roma e stato fantastico sono stato cinque anni e mezzo li ho fatto una bella carriera devo tutto a questa societa la roma mi ha dato la possibilita di dimostrare le mie qualita come calciatore sono grato alla societa ho avuto un bel rapporto con i tifosi ora e normale che dopo il cambio di maglia con i tifosi ci sia non dico odio pero un po di amarezza poi ci sono persone che approfittano di queste situazioni pero io ho dei bei ricordi di roma che rimarra sempre nella mia testa e nel mio cuore
6815426 e normale che essendo un ex gli occhi siano piu su di me che su altri giocatori sara una partita difficile perche conosco la roma e per me sara una partita speciale l esordio in una gara ufficiale con la maglia dell inter contro la mia ultima squadra speriamo che sia una serata bellissima e che l inter possa vincere
6815427 io arrivo molto bene a questo momento della stagione ma arriva bene soprattutto la squadra perche abbiamo fatto una grande preparazione siamo al top per la partita di domenica perche e importante iniziare bene la stagione
6815428 ho rispetto per la roma penso proprio di no magari esultero con i compagni l importante e che questa coppa rimanga a milano perche questo e l obiettivo a cui puntiamo e chiaro che se tu fai gol e importante ma la vera cosa importante e che l inter vinca
6815429 con spalletti ho lavorato per tre anni con mourinho solo da un mese e devo dire che sono due grandissimi allenatori che conoscono molto bene il calcio molto preparati sono molto bravi entrambi
6815430 the lift hill was quick with great views of lake erie there was an abundance of airtime starting right out of the gate as you passed over the highway at the bottom of the first hill the ride was smooth and fast i was thinking of kenneywood during the ride with the use of the terrain and some the other features the ride is over quickly but every train stopped at the break run to cheers and applause
6815431 i must say the ride has beat my expectations the speed through out the ride is continuous but the operations were a disappointment it took 5 7 minutes for a train to dispatch

6815435 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6815436 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6815437 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6815438 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6815439 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6815440 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6815441 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6815442 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6815443 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6815444 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people

6815448 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday

6815450 last year over 50 000 visitors attended the congress which left no rooms available in the city this year the 3gsm is set to be even bigger
6815451 he had a lot of interest from many big clubs but he always told me one to one his preference was to stay
6815452 i was convinced he wanted to do that and i know he made sacrifices
6815453 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
6815454 the story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him

6815461 we have to play like coach samson siasia told us and not have everyone trying to do something special
6815462 we have to make sure we dont give them room to operate
6815463 messi is going to be a handful we know that but if you shut off the supply to messi it makes it more difficult for him
6815464 we actually gave that game up ourselves with the two penalties but this team has grown and now we have more experience i dont think well make the same mistakes twice
6815465 hopefully it will turn out how i say so that the boys can win the gold medal because they deserve it
6815466 but be careful nigeria are a good team we have to respect them but i am very confident in this team and in checho coach sergio batista
6815467 when i cant see other people tell me whats happening
6815468 will all of you rich kids put your fucking hands in the air
6815469 i felt manchester united had made up their mind to let him go before we were interested to maybe manchester city or to france so it was not necessarily us going in there and buying a player
6815470 mikael can play centre back he can also play left back and that is an area where we were a bit inexperienced he has a great team attitude and he can help us in the dressing room as well with his maturity
6815471 i do despair sometimes about what is written about us and ive been saying it for 18 months but it doesnt seem to make any difference
6815472 if someone had just made a phone call theyd have known that the boy played
6815473 he came over he played on tuesday in a reserve game arranged with qpr a week before that for james collins to play in
6815474 he played for 80 minutes he played we didnt fancy it and hes gone back
6815475 after the game me and nani went to qpr to watch south africa and australia and then i dropped him home so if wed had a big row he wouldnt have got in the car
6815476 we had two people playing in that game aside from the ones coming back from injuries bowyer played in it as did quashie
6815477 were trying to get another one arranged for next week for george mccartney and one or two others
6815478 i will miss toronto and the teams amazing supporters and fans toronto fc will always have special meaning for me because its the club that gave me my professional start
6815479 gt an spl title on your resume is a good thing
6815480 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6815481 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6815482 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6815483 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6815484 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6815485 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6815486 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6815487 praktisch f hrt das dazu dass menschen gezielt und identifizierbar diskriminiert und denunziert werden k nnen
6815488 google sollte sich nicht daran beteiligen dass nun ein digitaler pranger eingef hrt wird
6815489 i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6815490 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6815491 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6815492 i dont know whether he finished the medical or not he can explain to you but i heard he was completely free
6815493 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6815494 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6815495 while he is still here he is very much 100 per cent a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6815496 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6815497 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6815498 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6815499 anna rejected the facts before her in favor of characters and situations and myths operating more vibrantly inside her own mind that she lived most fully not in her life but on the page
6815500 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6815501 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6815502 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6815503 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
6815504 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient
6815505 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady has been discharged from beaumont hospital this afternoon following completion of his medical examinations

6815511 its too close to the start date to be possible
6815512 the themes of the sinners and saints good and evil play out with these symbolic representations of what we call heroes and villains
6815513 batman represents our redemption superman our dormant potential that lies within all of us
6815514 it goes beyond being dualistic the joker is us batman is us and when we embrace them both as aspects of ourselves were ready to be forgiven and ready to forgive
6815515 we need to create a new mythology for our superheroes
6815516 because theyre not parochial anymore theyre cross cultural were in dire need of mythologies that go to the next level of consciousness
6815517 batman needs to be concerned about not just gotham but a bigger arena

6815811 if i have omitted many of franciss sayings and deeds and if i have altered others and added still others which did not take place but which might have taken place i have done so not out of ignorance or impudence or irreverence but from a need to match the saints life with his myth bringing that life as fully into accord with its essence as possible
6815812 art has its right and not only the right but the duty to subject everything else to its essence it feeds upon the story then assimilates it slowly cunningly and turns it into legend
6815813 while writing this legend which is truer than truth itself i was overwhelmed by love reverence and admiration for francis the hero and great martyr
6815814 everywhere about me as i write i sensed the saints invisible presence because for me saint francis is the model of the dutiful man the man who by means of ceaseless supremely cruel struggle succeeds in fulfilling our highest obligation something higher even than morality or truth or beauty the obligation to transubstantiate the matter which god entrusted to us and turn it into spirit

6815825 traditional baptismal vows take another route they generally recognize that parents have a privilege and duty to raise their children regardless of sex to be faithful and independent adults girls supported in this way are not seen just as potential sexual victims but as whole people of god this is a better path to helping young women contend with popular culture

6815831 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6815832 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6815833 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6815834 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6815835 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6815836 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails

6815848 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a player
6815849 differences in opinion over what role the chief executive should undertake
6815850 i want to keep all my best players and that is what i intend to do but at the same token i am looking to bring in another two or three players if possible
6815851 i am telling you no one is for sale unless somebody offers me 20million for a player which is not going to happen then no one is for sale
6815852 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6815853 chelsea were very good but portsmouth had a bad day at the office that can happen to anybody before they could even get into the game it was already over for them
6815854 however chelsea were impressive but on one game you cannot assess too much
6815855 he is still very much a spurs player he played with his national team and i need to have a chat with him to see how he is physically after the journey home
6815856 but if he does play tottenham fans are the same as anyone and get behind the side if he starts scoring goals then those fans who were booing him last week will be cheering him
6815857 in my career as a manager ive signed countless shirts if a fan asks for an autograph you cannot control what they put in front of you it could be a blank piece of paper with an iou for 1 million i believe he was superb for bulgaria so lets hope he has something left in the tank to give us a victory on saturday
6815858 i have said december because it is what i have done for the last two years and i feel comfortable with that
6815859 but i dont want to put a time line on it or talk too much about it
6815860 as long as i enjoy it and my manager and team mates are happy you are in the team that is my main focus point
6815861 pre season is over now which means we start playing the games again
6815862 this is like the recent rumours of park going to japan its best to ignore it
6815863 drogba is better he has been working every day with the fitness coach i think next sunday it would be difficult for him but maybe against tottenham aug 31 he could play 30 to 45 minutes
6815864 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6815865 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority
6815866 in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that
6815867 its very timely these are two very important games for new zealand so its great to get to this point with selection options
6815868 i personally have never and the team hasnt either underestimated the challenge of these qualifying games
6815869 ive spoken with ryan since the olympics as has ricki and hes over the injury thats kept him out of the campaign so far and looking forward to getting back in the environment

6815871 we re proud to have such a broad cross section of support in the los angeles area from people who share the firm belief that john mccain is the best prepared leader to move america forward
6815872 we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
6815873 but she had been with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6815874 there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me
6815875 apple goes like this twisting an x sign next to my cheek
6815876 spain has got some very good goalkeepers in casillas and reina who both play at the top level
6815877 i have to take all the chances that are presented to me to play at the highest level also
6815878 im paying big money for loans if you think that clubs are doing other clubs favours theyre not trust me its been going on for years
6815879 he is different class probably the best player i have played with
6815880 we have ransford addo with us on trial he is currently playing in belgian for royal antwerp and was recommended to us by warren joyce who is the reserve team coach at united he has also coached royal antwerp and everyone knows they have a connection with manchester united
6815881 warren has compared him with craig cathcart who we are aware of at manchester united he spoke very highly of him and on that recommendation we have invited him for a trial
6815882 he is a very intelligent man first and foremost and quick
6815883 playing at home scoring and being voted man of the match was just perfect a massive boost
6815884 scolari congratulated me after the game as well as all my partners
6815885 it was an important game for him as well as it was his debut at stamford bridge and he wanted to show the best image possible to the fans
6815886 we have just played a game in england and to be champions you need to always play like this which is not going to be easy
6815887 as far as we are concerned we are not worried if manchester united waste chances at home
6815888 i think van persie a brilliant footballer but as a person he is still not really stable
6815889 i think that it is striking that after all those years at arsenal he still has a problem
6815890 i am not worried about that i know nothing about it only that klaas feels very good at ajax
6815891 we have already said earlier that we dont want to see a repeat of what happened last season when a player left ajax at a very late stage
6815892 he got to dublin airport and then i heard from william derby clerk of the course at york that racing was in doubt
6815893 as york had an extra 11 millimetres of rain he probably wasnt going to run so i was quite happy for him to turn round and come home
6815894 he was really only gone for about five hours and we were able to give him a canter when he got back in the afternoon and he was fresh and well
6815895 i didnt see him out this morning as i had to leave to come here newmarket but his rider reported that he is seriously well
6815896 we will go to the races and take on whatever turns up and we are happy to do that we concentrate on the racing and all i can say is that he is very well and we are hoping for a very good run
6815897 i will be using him when he goes to stud
6815898 the two monsters have turned up in duke of marmalade and new approach so it is a stunning juddmonte international
6815899 its very good that juddmonte were prepared to move it and it has made for the most fantastic race
6815900 its great to be part of it but we are boxing a little bit on the undercard
6815901 he won a group two last time out in great fashion hes in great form so well run him here and then put him away until the champion stakes
6815902 you dont normally pick up a ride in a group one race quite this late but it is great for me
6815903 its nice of brian meehan to think of me as there are a lot of good jockeys out there and i am desperately looking forward to it
6815904 hes only had the three runs this season and seems to be getting better each time
6815905 he wasnt beaten far by henrythenavigator at ascot so his form is rock solid brian wouldnt be running him if he didnt think he was up to the task
6815906 the first factor people notice about the car is the styling
6815907 its a refreshing and innovative design thats unlike anything else on the market its totally unique
6815908 companies would pay millions for our list of potential customers

6815911 lyles work questions the meaning of maleness and femaleness not to mention of blackness and whiteness is it possible that now we can look at identity as a constellation that each of us has inside of ourselves many fragments
6815912 i once met this art dealer he was a very rich guy he said he wanted to be the next big deal this guy told me he thought i was totally under appreciated and deserved so much better out of life that all my other art dealers had mishandled my career and therefore were ripping me off that i should be rich and famous by now well what was i going to tell him that he was wrong so i started to work with this guy and within a very short amount of time it became totally clear to me that this guy did not have a fucking clue as to what he was doing and if it had not been for him being a rich motherfucker he would have been out of the business a long time ago things started to fall apart and i decided to tell him to go fuck himself my wife said to me that she was on to this guy all along and that i was stupid for ever falling for his bullshit the only thing that i really fell for was believing this guy that i actually could be doing better for myself i just wish my wife didnt have to make me feel like such a dope for actually taking that kind of talk seriously
6815913 oh yeahhhh that guy the guy who was utterly terrifying in kalifornia where the hell has that guy been

6815919 chelsea has an abundance of good players that can be a huge strength because the champions league and the premier league is a marathon but if it doesnt go well it can also be a weakness
6815920 there are so many players in midfield that they will have to sacrifice very good and very experienced players they cant all play at once for a long time i thought that they had made up their mind that they would lose lampard and thats why they bought deco
6815921 so how it will work with essien mikel deco lampard ballack and cole will be interesting but one thing you have to say is that they have top quality to choose from
6815922 jose bosingwa is a good buy a powerful player good going forward and efficient
6815923 first the b c residents have the same strain as the outbreak strain that has been identified in ontario and second they have been exposed to the foods that are under recall
6815924 they are adults not elderly but they both have underlying conditions that put them at higher risk
6815925 this is a very high profile recall with a high profile company
6815926 the average consumer can check in their fridges for the recalled meat which they can return to stores or just discard
6815927 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6815928 there hasnt been any confirmation and the testing is ongoing its quite difficult because listeria has an incubation period between two and 30 days and it has been up to 90 days
6815929 were all jumping in and trying to get to the bottom of it the investigation is very complex and involved and it takes lot of old fashioned detective work

6815932 he is a very good player a fantastic player who all the coaches in the world like and would want him in their squad
6815933 i want to leave ive told the president the directors and the coach i want to play in the premier league
6815934 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team
6815935 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6815936 ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6815937 i think my period at real madrid has come to an end i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6815938 it needs to be understood that at that time he was at milan with different players with different characteristics
6815939 the champions there are different to the champions here we need to think about this balance
6815940 maybe he needs more confidence to train normally and to be given more time now i have nicolas anelka in a good situation and playing well
6815941 sheva needs time and i need time time to put him in the game in a situation better for chelsea and shevchenko because chelsea needs three points
6815942 at that time the federation had some problems taking me because i was with portugal and it is impossible to sign two contracts
6815943 we tried but it is impossible then i followed my life and the national team of england followed its own life
6815944 i am surprised by the news this week ive said before and will again i like brian he is a good man i met him three or four times and like his style and personality
6815945 the companys dual class voting structure means that the dolan family controls 75 of the voting rights giving it full control over the board of directors and the companys future philip falcone the guy who runs harbinger can make all the noise and demands he wants and he might even get a couple seats on a family controlled board but any ideas that falcone has are the equivalent of going up to the in a bar and telling him how he should run the business maybe hell do what you suggest and maybe he wont hell do whatever he wants and falcones stake isnt going to accomplish anything
6815946 they are sending a message that they want to play a role in the direction the company takes

6815985 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6815986 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6815987 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger

6815994 when youre down to plugging carl pavano into the rotation for the first time this season and only his third big league appearance since 2005 the word desperation comes to mind the schedule doesnt work for the yankees either 16 home games and 20 on the road
6815995 i ve just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story i need all of you to stop what youre doing and listen
6815996 the four young starters the yanks were most counting upon this year kennedy phil hughes jeff marquez and alan horne have tanked so badly physically and via performance that carl pavano likely will start a critical game
6815997 gee i was about to discuss topic c but did i already do that to this group or was it the other group 10 minutes ago

6816003 the fact that ceos earn millions while their workers struggle by on minimum wages is either not examined in classrooms or is shown by the mainstream model to be completely consistent with properly working markets and to be leading to the best of all possible worlds
6816004 this of course makes most of the students who are concerned by such issues switch to other disciplines because they find economics pointless for what they want to know and do so generally only the unquestioning students go on to get a phd and become professors with views just like the professors that taught them

6816012 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6816013 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6816014 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour

6816018 if i could hold hold out for now with these icecaps melting down
6816019 damn did see how hot and fresh these donuts are
6816020 that was eight years of awesomeness and family support and love
6816021 if all goes well those who have identification on them will be in and out with a ticket within four hours
6816022 i can 100 percent convey to you that the next season will be the most fantastic dance season in years
6816023 i just want the dance series to be fresh new and exciting every year im trying to use my connections to make strategic alliances to other major presenters nationally and internationally to bring the most interesting work to northrop
6816024 our direction will be what is the best world class art that we can put forward
6816025 you might see a new framework for presenting dance instead of a collection of five or six events youll see really interesting things happening around ballet international and contemporary dance emerging artists from europe i love how european festivals think about dance programming with a thesis and through line
6816026 how are we adding to the form what am i seeing out there thats exciting whats great dance that can inform not just the dance community but also the entire arts community theres so much thats not being seen in the twin cities that i want to see happen
6816027 what is the role of a major university research facility in this city what kind of art should be presented whats not being offered by the other major presenters in the community we should be about ideas research world class performing arts how do we put the arts first
6816028 the university is so excited to be asked to be thinking creatively about how what were presenting will be more in line with the curriculums and were pushing them to think in new ways around what were doing
6816029 im a native minnesotan i understand the culture but i spent the last 15 years somewhere else and traveled internationally to festivals i feel its been kind of stagnant here over the last 10 years but people still remember the excitement of when we used to be vibrant i just hope were part of a solution or answer to the question of where did all that go and why and what can we make happen here thats far more exciting
6816030 the great old american companies like alvin ailey american dance theater
6816031 some of the most exciting contemporary work is coming out of north africa
6816032 and i would love to figure out how to have balanchines work seen every year
6816033 having conversations about how to put together a really interesting ballet series that serves the diehards but also includes exciting contemporary ballet were looking at our modern and the most interesting debuts that might happen as part of the first season were curating off site
6816034 living in a creative space right now where im not just thinking about the bottom line but are we making the best creative decisions possible are we making the most exciting work happen here
6816035 from what ive seen in the world and what i know about the twin cities i want to make more great stuff happen here
6816036 we were manhandled we were threatened not to protest but we continued out of good faith
6816037 we dont feel we were given a level playing field
6816038 after the fire a true story of love and survival
6816039 we can have a special election i prefer to put it on this ballot november but you always have to go for the next best thing
6816040 the last special election in california was in 2005 and cost the state about 50 million
6816041 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6816042 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it

6816046 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including cafe dupri are feeling the effect for the past two months business at the cafe has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense
6816047 tell me how to set that up and i would be there in a heartbeat

6816052 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6816053 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6816054 i might have an opportunity to be out there one more time in september before this place goes but itll definitely hold a special place in my memories in my baseball career

6816061 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6816062 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6816063 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6816064 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6816065 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6816066 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6816067 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6816068 i believe that nokia and symbian are irrelevant companies at this point

6816077 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6816078 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6816079 i just try to take care of things i can control
6816080 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6816081 it feels great to actually put some runs across the board all halladay needs is one pretty much
6816082 after that he does what he does we pushed a few across and made it a little easier for him
6816083 when you play good teams to be able to have runs like that it makes a world of difference
6816084 ill take them any time i can get them its fun to pitch games like that
6816085 it means a lot for our guys on this team the organization myself and the fans
6816086 we hope to give it a good run the rest of the season and not only beat the yankees but weve got to beat a lot of other good teams
6816087 we came off a big 15 4 win in boston on sunday and then we had a couple of days where we kind of struggled with the bats but they came alive on thursday you hope you can just do half of that the rest of the season that would be great
6816088 even if we have volunteers come forth i still think it might be a good idea to merge
6816089 for all intents and purposes weve hammered out a deal as to how it would work
6816090 we want to encourage people to come out to the game on saturday and show support for minor hockey in the area and support two worthwhile charities
6816091 lets show the fans in new york how much we love hockey
6816092 it was really close i mean it was right there
6816093 in the end i think i lacked a bit of energy and endurance mostly it was so close i just had to squeeze her a little bit more and throw one last kick just to even it out and go to sudden death
6816094 dolor que llenas de l grimas mi coraz n este coraz n lastimado encerrado en tus alas en tus alas de tristeza

6816098 at the time he was such a d ckhead he wasnt very nice
6816099 definitely off from what the production hoped you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6816100 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

6816107 breiner is one of two officers suspended indefinitely without pay for engaging in sex acts during the undercover investigation breiner is the only officer trying to stop the city from suspending him saying that because he did what he was asked to do the punishment violated his constitutional rights i dont agree that he should have had sex i dont agree that lt curtis breaux told him he should have sex coffin said breiner has said all along that breaux told him he would have to have sex with the women to make the case breiner added that the other undercover officers didnt want to participate in the sting because they didnt want to have to testify in open court also the officers indicated their wives wouldnt allow it
6816108 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6816109 i think it will become motivation because three years ago we were just trying to make the playoffs and now we are trying to get past the first round the team has grown and its no longer just to make the playoffs lets see how far we can go right now were just trying to find out our strengths and weaknesses
6816110 but i spoke with steve a lot about these famous attacks and its because of him that i know so much about them
6816111 now this series is a matter of taking another look at these stories but mostly getting across the conservation message that they have
6816112 she expressed that she trusted him to take care of her training and diet
6816113 she indicated that they had expressly agreed that she would not take any prohibited substances however her relationship with her husband was currently conflictual
6816114 the difference youre going to see in jason this year is he is throwing the ball much better than ive seen him throw it
6816115 we knew he was going to be a tailback is senior year
6816116 we are looking to shore up some areas on our defensive line
6816117 skill wise we feel like we have some kids that are better than what we had last year but they are inexperienced inside linebackers are inexperienced too
6816118 being in shape is important but that doesnt make you win
6816119 being able to throw and catch doesnt do you any good if you cant protect it
6816120 two a days is a completely different animal compared to what it was when i first started coaching
6816121 now they show up probably in better shape than when they left
6816122 if we can get 40 to show up that would be good
6816123 were trying to improve the numbers were trying to turn the corner but what i told the kids is its not about quantity its about quality
6816124 we still dont have 5a numbers but were getting closer
6816125 i think the 7 on 7 title brings a lot of things but the last thing it brings is guaranteed wins
6816126 it brought them together a little bit got them in shape and lets them practice skills we did that very well but thats over and we got to start this portion of the year
6816127 now on a day like today its not that big of a deal any time you can bring them inside and take that direct sunlight off them its still hotter than you know what but at least they dont have the direct sunlight on them and still give them plenty of breaks its just nice
6816128 we are trying to get to the playoffs thats our expectation which i think is real high for a first year program
6816129 thats what we think we feel like we can compete for a playoff spot thats our goal
6816130 he can be a dominating force on the football field on both sides
6816131 we are going to play him a little bit at receiver and outside linebacker he is really good at attacking the quarterback
6816132 we have one offensive lineman left tackle ben collins returning and our quarterback brysen curb back
6816133 if you are going to have two guys back those are two pretty good ones to have back
6816134 i t has got to be the toughest district in the state
6816135 i thought we were in a real tough one but i think this one is a little tougher
6816136 dont worry chaplains dont usually die none have died in the iraq or afghanistan wars

6816141 i was really impressed with their retention from spring and how they picked up right where they left off
6816142 theres something about this group they know its their time
6816143 i think ive been spoiled the last couple of years
6816144 in the past the kids have been dying to show what they could do
6816145 if youre bending over youre beat some of these kids are going on their third year with me so they know what to expect
6816146 i told them i was proud of them for being out here but i was disappointed in what they did when they were here they came with the right frame of mind
6816147 were going to have to pick up the tempo ill get them there
6816148 the whole key for us is we need to play
6816149 we need more reps the kids know our program and its their turn to step up we have everything we need to have a good football team other than reps
6816150 were going to come back this evening and hopefully do even better

6816154 bringing indie fashion to the enmalled masses the bycorpus line features
6816155 things were snappy quick and the kids pretty much knew where to go
6816156 everybody was here and most everybody was here on time and we had a nice cool day
6816157 its a faster speed the practices are faster and the tempo is a little better weve already headed them in that direction a little bit and now they learn to keep up
6816158 eric is obviously key hes the one everyone knows about
6816159 our story will be how well we compete up front
6816160 there are some big question marks with some junior varsity players that have to come on michael nolan is our returning center he was second team all district in 2007 but i think he will be first team this year we have some big shoes to feel
6816161 hes the complete package when it comes to academics and athletics i dont think stanford would have recruited him if he hadnt have been i am excited hes committed there hes going to be a great success with or without football i am lucky to have him on my team i know that
6816162 we are just going to coach up the ones that we have
6816163 weve got some young ones that are inexperienced but they have enough talent to succeed its about getting better every week
6816164 a lot of the college guys that have watched him on film like his motor and the way he gets to the ball
6816165 you cant really tell much about the team until you get against somebody else in pads its a lot of review
6816166 whats funny about these kids is that theyll show up
6816167 the kids will be at the doorstep at 5 15 a m ready to go theyve always been that way and its a credit to them and their families
6816168 it went well our early practice focuses mostly on agility and getting back in shape

6816174 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6816175 in the whatever you say department fred durst of rock band limp bizkit directs the comedy
6816176 the longshots family friendly football film directed by drum roll please fred durst
6816177 unfortunately director fred durst blends all of these time honored components with the same skill level that he brought to the stage with his crappy band limp bizkit
6816178 musician turned director fred durst and screenwriter nick santora pile on so many clich s so many pandering side characters that only exist in the world of movies and so much saccharine sweetness that the result is more likely to make the viewer feel sick from sugar overload

6816207 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6816208 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6816209 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6816210 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6816211 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6816212 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6816213 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6816214 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6816215 we are united to fight india until we get freedom
6816216 we are a separate people we were never part of india
6816217 the indian army has unleashed a reign of terror in kashmir
6816218 the peace process between india and pakistan failed to change the ground situation in kashmir
6816219 now this festering wound is manifesting itself on the streets this is a mass uprising and in many ways more serious and comprehensive than the early 1990s
6816220 because the bible says nothing about dating or little about how a young man and a young woman should find a spouse we have no clear commandments on this subject
6816221 so then they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
6816222 if it doesnt work out ill just find someone else
6816223 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6816224 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6816225 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6816226 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6816227 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6816228 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6816229 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6816230 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6816231 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6816232 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6816233 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6816234 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6816235 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6816236 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6816237 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6816238 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6816239 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6816240 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6816241 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6816242 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6816243 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6816244 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6816245 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6816246 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6816247 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6816248 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6816249 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6816250 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6816251 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6816252 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6816253 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6816254 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6816255 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6816256 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6816257 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6816258 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6816259 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6816260 he is the guest of the iranian government who will control him until such time they have comfortably wrested control of the mahdi army away from him
6816261 if al sadr declares himself a marjaa too soon or under unsuitable circumstances even a hint from al sistani that questions his credentials will stick to him for years
6816262 the conditions must be perfect and thats why al sadr decided to focus on his studies for many years
6816263 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6816264 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6816265 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6816266 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6816267 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6816268 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6816269 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6816270 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6816271 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6816272 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
6816273 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
6816274 there is a distinction between domestic and export oriented firms switzerland is an open economy and will ultimately have to take its place in the international environment but at the moment it is in the lucky situation that the domestic economy is performing very well
6816275 we have seen a substantial increase in the labour force people have seen substantial salary increases in the last couple of years and are still consuming at a healthy level
6816276 we probably will have better economic growth than most of our neighbours because we still have very strong domestic demand we still have a very stable labour market almost full employment
6816277 we will see a moderation of growth but not to the extent that we will go into a stagnation phase or a recession
6816278 one important reason for that is that switzerland is benefitting from the turbulence in the financial sector the big banks did have big problems but looking at the broader perspective if people want to sell they still come to the swiss financial sector to complete their transactions
6816279 i will be ready but i dont know about playing in the preseason
6816280 we will have to wait and see its always making progress every day i come out here its getting better
6816281 tiens encore une cm msi qui bug ou qui marche pas du tout
6816282 patent threat scare tactics against free software are frequently used but have never been backed up
6816283 germanys approach is the sensible and traditional innocent until proven guilty and puts the onus on the mud slingers removing the payoff that proprietary vendors get from this anti foss free and open source software tactic neither the never ending sco story nor the notorious and pointless patent deals could continue if other legal systems took the same common sense approach
6816284 sco cant say in germany that linux violates scos intellectual property or that end users could be liable for violations of scos intellectual property or that linux is an unauthorized derivative of unix unless it can prove it
6816285 smaller countries that are able to target and focus their resources on a relatively small number of sports events can compete for medals on the international landscape
6816286 you can see from the medal table it doesnt take enormous numbers to get into the top 10
6816287 the country that has probably moved the most is great britain
6816288 three years ago the u k was characterized by having a disjointed system two years ago they started to get their act together
6816289 higher gdp per capita may also be associated with higher average nutrition and health levels which could also boost performance in some sports
6816290 i do believe in canada we have a ways to go to be coordinated and integrated
6816291 if we want to compete with the rest of the world we have to commit to that
6816292 after the concert joel invited her back to see the tour bus he showed her some baby photos of harlow joel isnt one to lie or hide things from nicole so the next day he told her about it on the phone nicole freaked out joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that
6816293 its moments like this that will continue to keep their wedding on hold
6816294 oldish drunk white guy with michael landon hair doing the humpty dance
6816295 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6816296 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6816297 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6816298 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6816299 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6816300 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6816301 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6816302 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6816303 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6816304 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6816305 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6816306 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6816307 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6816308 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6816309 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6816310 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6816311 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6816312 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6816313 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6816314 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6816315 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6816316 when more than 10 percent of a community opts out of vaccinations it leaves the entire community at risk because germs have a greater chance of causing an epidemic
6816317 wherever we have looked we have found pockets of unimmunized people associated with outbreaks
6816318 herd immunity doesnt work when people who are not part of the herd get sick
6816319 youre putting known toxins in a child before theyre 2 years old
6816320 if you read the list of ingredients about what youre putting intramuscularly into your child its scary
6816321 theyre not just giving you a little dose of dead bacteria
6816322 he was as sick as any child ive ever seen
6816323 i think it requires thinking a little bit outside your own child and your own family
6816324 we know that the risk associated with getting the disease is much higher than the risk of serious side effects after getting the vaccination
6816325 they assume that everyone will be exposed and everyone will get sick
6816326 there are a lot better ways to stay healthy than to inject your body with chemicals
6816327 doctors have become inappropriately comfortable writing off any reaction to vaccines as being a coincidence
6816328 once you decide that individuals are expendable in the name of the greater good how many is too many
6816329 you can decide that its ok to throw some people under the bus because thats the price of doing business
6816330 i think doctors tend to be taken back by how much i know
6816331 im a public health officials nightmare not because im not responsible but because im too responsible
6816332 people say youre putting my kid at risk but that doesnt make any sense at all
6816333 if the vaccine works im just putting my child at risk
6816334 when i say selfish its because of all the other children that could be potentially hurt
6816335 one of the biggest issues is that parents think theyre safe to make this decision
6816336 theres no memory of the consequences of these diseases we take our protection sometimes for granted
6816337 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
6816338 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney

6816340 the treatment is to immobilize it so hes in a cast for four weeks
6816341 all cannon balls are to be piled in square pyramids
6816342 all pyramids are to contain a square number of balls
6816343 look at this pyramid for example there are sixteen balls at the base then nine then four then one at the top making thirty balls in all but there must be six more balls or five fewer to make a square number
6816344 all you have to do is to put the right number of balls in your pyramids
6816345 i told him okay let me do it once more and i will stop then i asked him did he want to do it and he said yes
6816346 i saw other youngsters doing it and it was an emotional time this is part of our religion
6816347 you cant call this an injury here we are talking about religion and it doesnt cause a serious wound
6816348 no doubt i heard about it but it was an emotional time and the children were happy and anxious
6816349 now that the hd 4850 has been hanging around for a bit were beginning to see more and more companies jump on the aftermarket bandwagon the latest company to do this is palit bringing the highly popular hd 4850 to the also highly popular sonic line the hd 4850 has had so much going for it from the word go its aggressive pricing and excellent performance gave users everything they wanted it wasnt all rosy though while the use of a single slot cooler was handy it caused the card to run extremely hot
6816350 for many years the folks at cooler master have been in the business of creating aftermarket products for the diy do it yourself crowd having begun as an oem cooling manufacturer they realized that more and more of us were very interested in making our own systems after all we can build to suit our own needs and save some money in the process more recently they have delved into the performance segment of the market with offerings of power supplies cooling and enclosures todays article will be covering one of their newer releases the ucp series of power supply ucp is an acronym for ultimate circuit protection and the concept is to produce a power supply designed to meet the demands of the enthusiast crowd while offering an efficient design that will last for years to come

6816365 the growing number of lupus clinical trials and the rising level of interest among people with lupus about clinical research led us to the decision to create this new center
6816366 we have already seen an increase in demand for people with lupus to serve as study volunteers at the same time people with lupus have voiced frustration in finding trusted information to make informed decisions about joining a trial the ccte will help meet those needs
6816367 whether to participate in a clinical trial at a given time is a very personal decision
6816368 sometimes it makes sense to participate if current treatments arent working if there are side effects of the treatments a person is taking or just because its clear that without clinical trials there wont be progress in treating lupus but not everyone is a candidate for a clinical trial people need to talk to their doctor but also do their homework to learn as much as they can about whats involved before they volunteer for a clinical trial the lupus foundation of americas ccte provides a way for them to get that information from a source they trust
6816369 its sad that their school was damaged to the point that its unusable
6816370 its important that the students have a safe and comfortable building to attend classes and were doing everything we can to make it happen
6816371 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor

6816376 parents of those young adults will have an option to give their children access to adequate health care
6816377 this also invites thousands of additional healthy young adults into insurance pools which can have a positive benefit for everyone
6816378 if theres just one person whos unhealthy the rates can skyrocket for everyone
6816379 and if theres one thing we know about the insurance industry its that they arent going to pay an extra dime
6816380 there are hundreds of thousands who have the option to buy coverage in the private market now that have failed to do so
6816381 would allow providers to withhold critical health care information without telling their patients
6816382 muddies the line between abortion and contraception and consider it an opening for health care providers to more often refuse to prescribe birth control and other forms of contraception and limit womens healthcare options
6816383 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
6816384 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
6816385 giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
6816386 still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6816387 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience

6816398 not on his friends its as if they didnt exist how did you know
6816399 the chief asked records to look but the organization has no information on them so i took a train to cambridge vances file is still there but when i asked to see the files of the other eight they were missing
6816400 i suspect his companions are more connected to this than we earlier had imagined
6816401 why wouldnt vances file be missing as well if that were true
6816402 when i was in spain in 36 to fight for the loyalists there was a captain who would send out his most aggressive newest recruit as a scout
6816403 the captain would build the new soldier up telling him how much confidence he had in him and how important he was to the unit and his bravery was needed to lead the others then hed send the soldier as a scout far enough ahead that hed draw the fire of any snipers waiting in ambush and the other soldiers in the company would know where the enemy was hiding and could attack them
6816404 vance is their live bait lets say youre delving deep into dark forbidden knowledge and you have plans long term plans to gain power you form a secret society of like minded people if you were highly intelligent you also might think beyond the immediate future youd want someone like vance clever enough to avoid the detection of the police but who would eventually draw out the opposition so you would know who they were
6816405 if such a group existed couldnt they simply use a divination spell

6816409 there have been times ive thought ive been watched as if im being stalked by an unseen enemy
6816410 no but if beaus right they might not act right away they could be more subtle than that
6816411 yes i went to the scene myself perhaps he feared we were on to his next target
6816412 and you thought there was a chance that she had turned me and i should die because of it after all weve been through together

6816419 the ghg reduction plan will help make monmouth a cool county by reducing operational emissions that are contributing to global warming and climate change
6816420 the objective of the program is to reduce energy bills develop alternative sources of energy preserve open space and farmland implement better land use policies incorporate leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards in new construction and significant rehabilitation of buildings improve air quality promote waste to energy programs expand transportation and work choices to reduce traffic congestion and foster economic development and job creation through energy conservation and new technologies
6816421 we have learned that there is a consensus among the worlds leading scientists that climate change caused by human emission of greenhouse gases is among the most significant problems facing the world today
6816422 documented impacts of climate change include but are not limited to increased occurrences of extreme weather events i e droughts and floods adverse impacts on plants and wildlife habitats and threats to global food and water supplies all of which have an economic impact on communities and their local governments we must not lose any more time in addressing these challenges
6816423 the economic arguments for implementing climate solutions are compelling from the near term economic gains of energy efficiency to long term climate stabilization that can prevent irreparable harm from catastrophic climate change impacts
6816424 this initiative will move monmouth county toward energy independence save taxpayer money and enable the county to take advantage of state and federal incentives and grants it will also burnish monmouth countys reputation as a community of choice by fostering economic development and improving our quality of life

6816568 el bar a se planta en el fichaje de hernanes por 14 millones
6816569 jos luis carazo la sorpresa en la posible mejora de la plantilla azulgrana tiene nombre y apellidos olhar hernanes pues su fichaje parece ser que se ha reactivado el jugador como anunciamos en el pasado mes de julio estaba cerrado en unas cantidades y nicamente faltaba el compromiso verbal a falta de los famosos flecos txiki al final se vio obligado a recular porque el representante del jugador se destap pidiendo otras cantidades con henrique intent lo mismo pero palmeiras amenaz con hacer valer el acuerdo hab a testigos y por esa circunstancia acab cerr ndose con hernanes fue distinto nos cuentan que guardiola ha llegado pronto a uno de los eternos problemas de rijkaard el dilema xavi o iniesta resuelto siempre con ambos en la alineaci n con ambos el bar a es d bil en el repliegue se perfila volver al pensamiento inicial y considerar que al bar a le falta el perfil deco
6816570 desde hace unos d as se habla tambi n de que el bar a est dispuesto a pagar la cl usula del jugador del sevilla que asciende a 15 millones de euros para hacerse con los servicios de capel pero la realidad es bien distinta el ex jugador del bar a no encaja en el perfil guardiola puesto que el t cnico azulgrana quiere primer toque y movimiento sin bal n jugadores excelentes tomando decisiones leyendo los partidos quiere gol y capacidad entre l neas se busca la ant tesis de capel los asuntos del sevillista los lleva el hermano de sergio ramos y todo parece indicar que en toda esta movida se busca promocionarlo para provocar un aumento salarial justificado en una subida de la cl usula de rescisi n esa es la realidad
6816571 joder no soy tan bueno este no es el camino

6816573 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6816574 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6816575 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6816576 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6816577 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6816578 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6816579 de uma perspectiva esportiva obviamente sua mudan a para a renault n o foi boa

6816589 we have invested a lot to expand the capability of our factory and in research and development
6816590 yoghurt with its functional benefits is a high growth product in malaysia because people are becoming more health conscious
6816591 in abdul kalam we have one of indias foremost scientists whose achievements and national contributions were further showcased when he became indias 11th president
6816592 we look forward to hear his views on how knowledge forms the basis for development of individuals communities and nations
6816593 among the contributing factors for this increase were the substantial rise in the electricity tariff announced by the government commencing july 1 and the knock on effect from the price increase of petrol and diesel
6816594 although bank negara kept rates on hold in july we do think that the central bank should be getting quite uncomfortable with inflation as high as it is now
6816595 already there are indications of wages picking up with manufacturing wage growth having risen to 5 9 per cent in the first quarter from three per cent in 2006
6816596 investors are finally beginning to look past politics and shifting their focus back to fundamentals and finding value in malaysia
6816597 as politics in malaysia stabilises the klci will have a modest re rating
6816598 asked about high beta sectors such as construction and bombed out value stocks
6816599 although the construction industry and property market is going through a rough patch there are always opportunities in every crisis
6816600 we see potential in unplasticised polyvinyl chloride upvc replacing traditional building materials such as wood concrete and clay in pipings and now roofing
6816601 upvc roofing is ideal for use in low cost housing shop lots and industrial buildings
6816602 issues we raised centred on licensing for metal traders recruitment of foreign labour distribution of government contracts to indian contractors and training for indian youths in hair styling and food and beverages sector
6816603 hektar reits net profit grew 10 9 per cent year on year to rm9 4 million in the second quarter ended june 30 this year

6816605 over one million malaysians live within 15 minutes drive time of our shopping centres
6816606 singapore is our major export market and based on our study the country has a solid construction market
6816607 we are suppliers for the worlds largest biodiesel factory and solar panel factory in singapore
6816608 hopefully it will be able to turn around this fiscal year because this country has a longer gestation period
6816609 we have sold about 100 000 cars in the first seven months
6816610 when we launched the myvi in 2005 the average monthly sales was 5 500 units before rising to 6 600 units in 2007 and 7 500 units in 2007
6816611 the cost saving is about 10 per cent and the price is about the same or cheaper than the conventional product because we save on the mould the product is also 30 per cent lighter than the conventional one because it doesnt require mortar and plastering or even cranes
6816612 offer more timely comprehensive assessment of the real world experience of their devices and an alternative means to conduct mandated post approval studies
6816613 one of the challenges the fda and other agencies face is being able to devote resources in a continuing way and our view is that registries will bring up more questions than answers
6816614 it wouldnt be impossible to do it through a government run agency but it is a bigger challenge
6816615 unless there are some safeguards in place people would be wary of a federal run system it may even discourage some people from reporting adverse events
6816616 we want to reduce our co2 emission by 50 per cent to about 70 000 tonnes by 2011 we know that we are setting ourselves a great challenge right now we dont know all the answers to achieve the goal but we believe we have the spirit within ourselves to find the answers
6816617 we want to make a difference in this critical issue it starts with getting our stakeholders across our value chain by gradually changing their mindsets about climate change that going green can be mutually beneficial for everyone and not just another business expense
6816618 the service is awful i made a reservation and canceled it same day

6816723 this survey gives a unique insight into the behaviour of the online offline audio community and the impact of new audio formats on tradition listening it also provides perspective on the relative impact of each of these activities
6816724 the fundamental difference between traditional radio and web radio is the two way interaction with the audience and the ability to see instant listener stats who is listening where they are listening from how long they are listening for etc
6816725 if the site is truly geared towards online broadcasting rather than just a secondary tick the box stream from one of the analogue broadcasters there will also be a strong sense of community and social networking on the radio stations website users maintain a profile and an existence when not listening or surfing which grows and develops the more they feed it all of this combines to make the user a part of the station not just a listener it becomes a lifestyle process rather than something you might switch on occasionally in the background at radio popbitch for example as well as the aspect of the social interaction the listener has fundamental control over the playlist they own the system and it sounds incredible fresh exciting and incredibly listenable

6816733 and why would you want to watch a piece of video on your home tv in full screen that is already woolly when watching it in a small window on your pc blow it up to 32 inches and its like watching it through a swimming pool even the iplayer cant provide quality to this standard yet from their online platform and thats as good as it gets

6816780 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6816781 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6816782 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6816783 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6816784 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6816785 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails

6816798 the ability to sequence any individuals genome inexpensively and accurately is the quantum leap needed to usher in an age of personalized medicine in which healthcare providers will routinely use an individuals genetic code to prevent diagnose and treat diseases

6816840 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6816841 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6816846 we want to give students involved in this project an opportunity to gain experience integrating new technology into their studies
6816847 we want to know if the devices can make a difference
6816848 this pilot test is a wonderful opportunity for us to see how equipping students with advanced mobile devices will improve their educational experience
6816849 students are increasingly tech savvy mobile technology is advancing rapidly and a world class research university should be prepared to exploit the educational possibilities
6816850 if the technology will help make a large university smaller and more accessible thats important if it can enhance learning then we need to find out
6816851 weve done extensive planning so that the technology we give our students will help enrich their college experience
6816852 the technology has a great many possibilities and were much more likely to discover them if we go about this in a systematic way
6816853 the mobility initiative will provide students with a unique way to access campus resources and course materials and to communicate with others
6816854 maryland and other research universities could effectively work together as a consortium to develop applications that are targeted to higher education
6816855 to develop a tool that can have an impact at maryland students are embracing this technology and the university is intent on using it to improve their educational experience here on campus
6816856 cyanobacteria produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis and green sulfur bacteria can survive only in environments where oxygen is absent

6816861 what we need is a single system there are some games that are already rated at 18 on the current system but would be at 15 on the new cinema model what we do need is legal enforcement of the pegi standard because now if a child of 12 wants to buy a 16 plus game the retailer has to sell it to them
6816862 were in the business of providing great games to a broad audience of gamers and we need to be able to fulfill that role by getting products to consumers quickly and at a good price were concerned with any measures that would mean this process is made more unwieldy or incurs additional costs which have to be shared with the consumer
6816863 we are disappointed and concerned about attempts by one or two video game publishers to pre empt through recent press statements the forthcoming public consultation on video games classification their statements are misleading in several respects
6816864 weve been told by engineers at google that the technology is not ready to be deployed in our view they need a persons consent if they make use of a persons face for commercial ends
6816865 we tested the technology thoroughly before launch and i am confident that it finds and blurs the vast majority of identifiable faces and license plates
6816866 for the few that we miss the tools within the product make it easy for users to report a face or license plate for extra blurring
6816867 i strongly believe that this type of privacy enabling technology together with effective controls for users is the best way of meeting the challenge of respecting peoples expectation of privacy without stifling the development of new products and services that everyone can enjoy and benefit from
6816868 anything that makes maps easier to use is great and thats exactly what google is trying to do taking street photos and connecting them with maps to aid navigation
6816869 but the minute this invades peoples privacy a line has been crossed the debate reinforces the need to respect the publics right to privacy more than anything else google will adapt their service to local laws as required so i cant see street view not happening in the uk just changing if required
6816870 it is inevitable that many of the photographs used on street view will include personal information about living individuals faces ethnic origin number plates home addresses and other identifiables and if google is going to use such personal information they have a moral and legal duty to ensure that the people whose personal information they will be using understand that google have it know what it is to be used for and have consented to that use
6816871 regardless of the severity of the outcome we believe that the majority of the disruption will fall on the price and availability of ddr3
6816872 takes about two years from the time the office grants a petition for a re examination to make a final determination
6816873 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6816874 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6816875 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6816876 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6816877 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6816878 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6816879 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6816880 the new generation of chinese feel that they are living in a time of great change they are much more open to change and progress than previous generations
6816881 however in china even within this younger generation face to face interaction is still regarded as being important
6816882 what we do see is that chat sites are extremely prominent in china when asked how important online social networks and communities were in their life 75 per cent of the chinese said they were important with facebook entering the chinese market it will allow them to capitalise on the current success of chat sites if they can launch of facebook as the next generation messenger site which should be feasible considering the recent launch of the facebook chat facility then facebook could prove a huge success in china

6816889 the definition of web 3 0 however is much more difficult to define great funwall of china
6816890 we will be providing an api to facebook where they will create a rich search experience including a web search for the facebook users and thats something that they will launch in the fall working with us and itll carry both our web results as well as our paid search advertising
6816891 social networking sites are not great for click through on advertising content no one goes to myspace to find a cheap flight to new york or to buy a new tv
6816892 no doubt that integrating your social networking contacts and updates on your home page makes a great deal of sense however this would be alongside your gmail or hotmail account weather news etc and social networking sites are not currently able to take this breadth of content facebook needs to provide a better service than igoogle and it is hard to see how they will deliver this
6816893 with the right spin on personalising your search facebook search could innovate how we search for things for instance users could link in to what friends may be searching for getting more direct feedback on whether search results were appropriate social search sites need critical mass usage to be useful and the ones currently available do not have this yet maybe facebook and microsoft can deliver on this
6816894 whats important about the deal is that if they can make it work microsoft will finally have secured msns first significant search partner thats hardly going to have a seismic effect on the sector but it is a vital step in their campaign to catch up on google
6816895 we developed a good relationship with pbmr and murray amp roberts on phase 1 and look forward to working with them again on phase 2

6816898 theres definitely some significant shortcomings with facebooks privacy settings and with their ability to protect users
6816899 weve reviewed the complaint and found it has serious factual errors most notably its neglect of the fact that almost all facebook data is willingly shared by users
6816900 our investigation found that this is not entirely true for example even if you select the strongest privacy settings your information may be shared more widely if your facebook friends have lower privacy settings as well if you add a third party application offered on facebook you have no choice but to let the application developer access all your information even if they dont need it
6816901 youtube appropriates the value of creative content on a massive scale for youtubes benefit without payment or license youtubes brazen disregard of the intellectual property laws fundamentally threatens not just plaintiffs but the economic underpinnings of one of the most important sectors of the united states economy
6816902 threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information news entertainment and political and artistic expression
6816903 far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works
6816904 the spread of illegal downloading dangerously undermines the entertainment industries and dilutes the value of copyright law
6816905 placing the full weight of moral responsibility technological investment and legal liability on the isps shoulders would be unworkable
6816906 the effect of illegal downloads on the music industry sales are at their lowest in ten years is there for all to see what is equally clear however is that wholesale sanctions are not the answer understanding the motives of illegal downloaders and developing a framework for policing and legislation is vital only when the industry is acting unilaterally and accepts shared responsibility for illegally downloaded music will it have any hope of enduring against it
6816907 downloading music is so important to me as a producer and as a dj i dont know how we survived without it i wish we could stop piracy but unfortunately its now a way of life so we have to accept it and use it to our advantage more people now get to hear my music and its much easier for me to promote myself as an artist ive just mixed the judgement sundays album for ministry of sound and was able to send it to the label and get all the tracks for it without leaving the studio to me thats priceless
6816908 its very difficult to gauge the exact impact of piracy as youre never really sure just how widespread it is
6816909 the expansion of digital music has allowed them instant access to international producers and a wider range of labels and choice obviously the availability of free music is even more tempting and is a real problem in certain countries and allows music to be disseminated widely without the need for expensive publicity campaigns often bookings are based on the djs promoters playing your music a lot and then wanting to bring you over in person so if pirated music is more easily available this could help to some extent
6816910 i was one of those people who went around the back of the bike shed with songs i had taped off the radio the night before but this totally dwarfs that and anything we expected
6816911 the positive message is that 80 per cent of downloaders said they would pay for a legal subscription based service and they told us they would be willing to pay more than a few pounds a month
6816912 so as far as the future is concerned we will continue to see the fallout from the outmoded 20th century precedent with people accessing music in a number of ways illegal file sharing will continue notwithstanding people will buy music if it is social fun supports the artists and gives them freedom to discover and engage
6816913 one of the main problems surrounding the music industry is that the majority of people do not understand what is right or wrong when it comes to downloading from the web
6816914 the internet has been a real headache for record companies mainly because the industry has failed to react as fast the technology around it the sheer scale of the number of unlicensed recordings occurring as a result of file sharing amongst music fans has both frightened and galvanised the recording industry
6816915 the price of cds in the shops has fallen significantly over the last couple of years and overall sales have dropped
6816916 denn was war zuerst da die henne oder das ei der sozial kompetente sch ler der sich sozial engagiert oder der ehrenamtlich aktive der hierdurch soziale kompetenzen erwirbt
6816917 many knowledge workers regard training and professional development as the responsibility of the organization not their own
6816918 i think were operating from old knowledge and learning paradigms that developed in an industrial age when companies owned the means of production
6816919 im going to take charge of my own learning im going to be curious and pay attention to whats changing and where things are going and im going to pro actively prepare myself for those things regardless of whether or not the organization tells me i need to learn this
6816920 though social network advertising is forecast to grow aggressively this year it will only do so if social network operators can develop substantial metrics showing the value and performance of the advertising
6816921 profiting from social media has always been difficult web 2 0 has become synonymous with free users expect or even demand gratis access to content and services sites that have traditionally charged for access have either changed their model to free such as where are you know or like friendsreunited died a slow death
6816922 web users especially early adopters are horribly fickle and wont think twice about moving to a free alternative increasingly low barriers to entry mean that there are likely to be handful of near identical competitors
6816923 in my opinion the two main ways that a site can hold onto users is either via strong community providing masses of user generated content i e youtube or providing tools and services that are simply better than the competition for the former ad revenue remains the best plan although last fm has successfully implemented a premium plan giving extra features and special access to cool new stuff for the latter subscription services provide monthly revenues possibly on top of any ad revenues which is a classic way of monetising a free version
6816924 part of the reason that the istock community thrives so thoroughly is that we were a community first before we were a business and although we are now a 70 million enterprise localised in 12 languages the community remains prevalent in all of our decision making
6816925 we are different from other social networks and the copycat microstocks that came after us because our approach to the community remains humble compassionate and educational we share things with them we welcome suggestion criticism and complaints and we fully appreciate that the community will drive us forward some of our best features such as video clips and audio tracks are created because our community requests them
6816926 another reason we are so successful is that we share revenues with contributors in 2007 we paid out more than 20 9 million in royalties to member artists some of whom make a full time living from istock
6816927 since going live in april 2007 more than 1 11 million people have accessed or used either the answer center or online invitation solutions on the obama web site
6816928 not since television has something changed the run for the white house as the internet and with more and more americans accessing the web and its youth collaborating via facebook myspace and the like it is more critical than ever that candidates have an open line of communication to its constituents
6816929 in the political space most of the channels are controlled by third parties with political bias and opinions e g newspapers and tv channels and it is important that political parties try and put their views opinions and policies in its purest form in real time the online environment is obviously perfect for this and social media lends itself perfectly to spreading this message
6816930 social media works best when the user has passion enthusiasm and genuine belief for a particular product or brand such as a football club
6816931 in the recent election for the london mayor social media started to play a part it is interesting that boris had four times as many fans on facebook as ken
6816932 social networking sites and particularly their group pages are already making a difference and in the us the use of youtube voting buttons for preferences prioritisation of issues and language options to demonstrate multiculturalism are already important data capture e crm and generating donations are also the norm
6816933 over the course of the year less than 2 per cent of political ad budgets will be spent online that pales in comparison to the 50 to 80 per cent of the budgets that will be spent on broadcast tv advertising
6816934 televisions ability to push candidates messages out to a mass audience and push it fast makes it the winner for this hotly contested election year
6816935 as a responsible isp we recognise that unauthorised file sharing is a serious issue we believe that by educating our customers we can help them to enjoy music online without the risks associated with downloading from unofficial sources
6816936 suspension or disconnection is not a consideration in this campaign as a responsible isp our goal is to increase awareness of the issues around unauthorised sharing of music
6816937 education is absolutely key to reducing the extent of illegal downloading and we are pleased to be working with virgin media on this campaign we believe that new partnerships with isps can help build an internet in which music is properly valued that will benefit not just musicians songwriters and labels but all internet users who love music this joint campaign with virgin media is the first step towards achieving that goal
6816938 the terms and conditions for virgin media state that people cannot use internet for anything illegal and their users do agree to being monitored
6816939 critics of this strategy claim that instead of penalising isps the music industry should be striking deals with p2p sites
6816940 however some isps who are also content owners such as virgin media may have a vested interest in encouraging consumers to get content legally rather than illegally virgin media offers content through virgin central its on demand player and movie channels and it may prefer to encourage consumers to use these legal channels rather than have users download content for free some isps believe they cannot be held responsible for the actions of their customers arguing it is analogous to car manufacturers being liable when their clients exceed the speed limits
6816941 the initiative between the bpi and virgin media is a valid one in trying to tackle a very difficult problem of piracy but there is always the continued danger of the music business alienating and punishing its consumers as a first point of call
6816942 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes nonetheless were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6816943 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress is very encouraging
6816944 its always an interesting engineering challenge whenever you arrive at a new circuit and today in valencia was no exception we spent two very productive sessions concentrating on tyre choice while running appropriate fuel levels lewis and heikki also performed faultlessly allowing us to collect plenty of valuable data which we will go through tonight
6816945 a great circuit and a first class job by the organisers and especially bernie for the maiden race here in
6816946 to reach our goal of sustainable energy we need everyones input literally if you can ambulate you can generate
6816947 a raft of non governmental organizations supported by american and other western foundations
6816948 spawned a class of young english speaking intellectuals hungry for pro western reforms
6816949 praised the israel defense forces for its role in training georgian troops and said israel should be proud of its military might in an interview with army radio israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers yakobashvili told army radio in hebrew referring to a private israeli group georgia had hired
6816950 a georgian military plant in which israeli experts are upgrading jet fighters for the georgian military russian fighter jets bombed runways inside the plant located near tbilisi where israeli security firm elbit is in charge of upgrading georgian su 25 jets
6816951 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
6816952 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
6816953 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran
6816954 price comparison sites independent user reviews bricks and mortar stores offering online discounts blogs the web based sources of information that influence a purchasing decision are seemingly endless in fact the imrg claims that 80 billion of consumer spending is either on or influenced by the internet
6816955 the sphere of influence wielded by the internet coupled with the transparency it creates means that brand and vendor differentiation based purely on price or product uniqueness is a thing of the past
6816956 for the more progressive vendor the emphasis on customer experience presents a clear opportunity to win the hearts and wallets of these i generation shoppers but not without some serious contemplation about what consumers expect when they transact online and were talking the entire consumer journey here pre sale sale and post sale
6816957 a recent poll of internet savvy consumers found that nearly a fifth 19 per cent had abandoned a purchase either because they couldnt find specific product information or ask questions about a product lack of information can be a deal breaker especially for big ticket items like lcd tvs etc
6816958 the definition of web 3 0 however is much more difficult to define
6816959 when we talk about semantics were talking about meaning and knowledge and nobody has managed to define these consistently from a philosophical point of view
6816960 from a pragmatic point of view if a computer gives people useful answers it could be said to be intelligent or that it knows about things but this is different from claiming that it is genuinely intelligent or knowledgeable in a human sense that is still a long way off so far as anyone can tell
6816961 ignoring issues of bandwidth the current web infrastructure stack is adequate to understand meaning the current web utilises a protocol called http this is a very simple and powerful protocol for the retrieval update and querying of web resources what does need to change is the way in which we tools applications use this protocol and the kinds of resources we create and consume currently most resources are produced by humans or machines for consumption by humans i e they end up in a browser as html web pages for machines to understand meaning we need them to be able to produce and consume web resources
6816962 while html web pages contain natural language and obviously convey meaning to those who read that language natural language machine processing is limited
6816963 by making resources either contain a semantic mark up or by web servers publishing a semantic mark up the web can get smarter by smarter i really mean that we can start organising and finding information based on concepts and subjects and not via full text inferences
6816964 the next developments in the semantic web are that large online companies will start to publish their data in semantic web formats alongside the existing html formats and that developers will start to build applications on top of these new semantic web structures
6816965 we are trying for a secular government in jharkhand to keep communal forces at bay
6816966 i mean give me a number is it 50 000 100 000 200 000 everybody keeps talking about who were going to tax how can you define that
6816967 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
6816968 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
6816969 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
6816970 what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
6816971 the far fetched analogies the obscure references the succession of latinate polysyllabic words
6816972 the shrill and clamant voice of english radicalism thrilling with self accusatory and joyful lamentation nostra culpa nostra maxima culpa we have invaded we have conquered we have dominated we have exploited
6816973 from the time of john kennedys assassination in 1963 to jimmy carters election in 1976
6816974 white men imposed quotas on us and now were going to do the same to them
6816975 whites bused blacks to enforce segregation and now they deserve to get a taste of their own medicine
6816976 i utterly reject that view the american people the most generous on earth who created the highest standard of living are not going to accept the notion that we can only make a better world for others by moving backwards ourselves
6816977 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
6816978 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
6816979 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
6816980 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
6816981 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
6816982 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
6816983 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
6816984 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
6816985 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman
6816986 if we have 10 percent better connectivity in the us we get 10 percent more revenue in the us and those are big numbers for us
6816987 given the numerous device failures that have resulted during fcc testing it seems a little disingenuous for mr page to simply dismiss the interference concerns jeopardising the future of digital television with an unproven technology would be unwise and unwarranted
6816988 i am totally confident that if we have rules that say you can use the spectrum under conditions that you cause no interference that those devices will get produced and in fact hundreds of millions of dollars will be invested in making those devices non interfering
6816989 i bet 100 per cent that it will happen its just a question of what year
6816990 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6816991 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6816992 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6816993 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6816994 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6816995 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6816996 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6816997 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6816998 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6816999 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6817000 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6817001 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6817002 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6817003 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6817004 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6817005 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6817006 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6817007 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6817008 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6817009 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6817010 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6817011 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6817012 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6817013 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6817014 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a to where he stood
6817015 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6817016 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6817017 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6817018 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6817019 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6817020 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6817021 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6817022 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6817023 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6817024 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6817025 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6817026 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6817027 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6817028 that gave the party control of the house after 40 years in the minority
6817029 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6817030 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6817031 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6817032 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6817033 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6817034 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
6817035 theres a lot of people kind of groping in the semidarkness
6817036 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6817037 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6817038 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in
6817039 wedge issues such as busing and affirmative action to polarize voters
6817040 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6817041 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6817042 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6817043 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the
6817044 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6817045 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6817046 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6817047 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6817048 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6817049 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6817050 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6817051 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6817052 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6817053 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6817054 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6817055 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6817056 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6817057 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6817058 we expect two players to continue to perform strongly google and amazon both google and amazon com are still racking up annual growth rates in the 30 to 40 per cent range with only a relatively modest slowdown in sight
6817059 analysts are always looking for the black and white we do not live in a linear world where x necessarily always equals y just because a certain organisation is on to a good thing now does not mean it will definitely continue in the ascent in the future
6817060 we believe this is a unique offering in the sector today something that sets us apart engagement between higher education and business is beginning to happen in a big way
6817061 as knowledge producers and educators universities are being urged to contribute to the knowledge economy by government and other policy makers meanwhile business is being encouraged to invest in and use the resources of university expertise the web site is an important tool in bringing our university resources and businesses closer together
6817062 predominantly we expect companies to be from the creative industries and it sector but any sector where there are young dynamic employees very familiar with web 2 0 technology
6817063 the problem of some universities is that they are unsure of their goal from any engagement with businesses
6817064 we are already in j amp k for counter insurgency role but getting into law and order getting into internal security situations is not really desirable it is not desirable our troops to get entrenched with the crowds
6817065 the police and para military forces have done a great job in difficult circumstances all kudos to them
6817066 the walls around the garden are coming down the implementation of data availability injects a new layer of social activity and creates a more dynamic internet
6817067 we alongside our data availability launch partners are pioneering a new way for the global community to integrate their social experiences web wide
6817068 yahoo believes in an open internet that gives users the flexibility to make their web experiences as relevant social and personalised as they can as a long time collaborator with myspace on a variety of projects including the opensocial foundation were thrilled to support this new initiative
6817069 the yahoo open strategy and myspace data availability are a giant leap towards a more social and open internet
6817070 myspace looks to have chosen to make the move now because of the competitive nature of the social networking space
6817071 there have been a number of power plays over the last few months between microsoft yahoo google facebook and myspace market share and owning the customer and their data must be a driver here whoever wins the customers data and hence trust has a major opportunity to monetise that down the line in ways we havent even thought of yet myspace is now owned by news corp and mr murdoch knows a thing or two about penetrating new markets and expanding within how long before our sky schedules can be shown on our myspace page in addition myspace was slow to allow the integration of applications in comparison to facebook so being first with this is important to myspace and gives it the chance to be seen as leading the field
6817072 the days of one company one website one url hosting your online social interactions are long dead theres just one social network and its called the web anyone wanting to listen into and participate in online conversations will quickly find out today that the conversation is not hosted in one place the conversation is now distributed and will be forever more
6817073 friendfeed is a service for people to keep up to date on the web pages photos videos and music that their friends and family are sharing the goal of friendfeed is to make content on the web more relevant and useful for you by using your existing social network as a tool for discovering interesting information
6817074 the atomisation of the web means that users have pockets of information fragmented all over the web just think about a regular person who watches favourites and maybe posts a few videos on youtube puts their family holiday snaps on flickr comments on a blog they read daily shares links from their google reader multiply this by a blog you write the comments on that blog the links to it tweets on twitter facebook updates de licio us digg and stumble upon tags and then multiply by the number of friends you follow and the fragmentation and amount of this information becomes overwhelming to the point of overload
6817075 friendfeed helps that by aggregating all that information in one place so you dont have to traverse numerous websites to keep in touch with the information it helps you stay on top of whats grabbing your friends attention and keeps you connected you also get full control of the people you follow and can un follow at any time
6817076 friendfeed gives you control over the web 2 0 noise and lets you consume it in a way that is relevant to you
6817077 if being an expert or leader in your market is defined as others regard for your insight skills products or services then you must participate in the networks where this expertise is being shared and where the people you want to influence are going to help shape their viewpoint for many b2b professions these networks remain predominantly offline but this balance will tip in favour of online for most if not all professions eventually
6817078 if you want to be part of the conversation you need to keep up with the topical threads services such as friendfeed allow you to track the critical influencers in your market to keep abreast of the dominant memes the days of just getting in touch when you have something to say are gone
6817079 we use friendfeed as a central portal to collate most of our social media activity in order to reflect and communicate our brand personality everything from our tweets through to our bookmarks on
6817080 i believe the benefits of friendfeed are the ability to build a strong team ethic and create a sense of belonging for every single member of our team
6817081 on the flip side if youre following an organisation a friend or even an influential blogger a lot can be learnt about their online activity you can see what they are saying and posting about certain topics and issues and should you want to contact them for whatever reason you can be much more personal and in sync with their interests and values
6817082 its a brave step for any organisation to use friendfeed as it offers a more personal insight into what a company is really all about this may not necessarily reflect the messaging on the companys website this can work for you but quite easily work against you and brand could be tarnished i would expect to see some organisations gaining the wrong type of exposure because of their friendfeed posts i just hope it isnt us
6817083 most advertisers simply dont know how to market properly within social networks too many marketers create dull non interactive pages inside social networks and wait for a viral marketing effect to bring users to their door but our research clearly shows that ongoing promotion and advertising as well as the use of even relatively simple forms of engagement are vital to the success of branded social networking pages
6817084 as online advertisers make increasingly large investments in social marketing and web 2 0 its vital that they get the most for their money by following the examples of whats worked for other marketers and listening to what consumers want such as original and entertaining multimedia content advertisers can greatly improve the effectiveness of their social marketing efforts
6817085 the biggest problem is that many marketers still treat people as media these are people and people will always resist strongly our attempts to use them as channels through which to sell our shampoo and toothpaste products
6817086 nearly everything we do in the dominant marketing world is based on asking questions like how do we talk to as few people as possible to have as big an impact as possible
6817087 what do both these have in common i think they are both asking who do i have to talk to get something done around here in both the dominant and the emergent worlds were assuming that we the marketers the brands the companies are the subject of the sentence its all about us and what we want to do this is the biggest mistake we cant buy people like we can buy media space we cant come to an understanding with them like we do with editorial teams

6817089 operators seeking to keep apace with the mobile industry are under continuing pressure to roll out new advanced data services to keep their lucrative style and technology conscious subscribers happy and create additional revenue generating streams in the face of falling voice revenues software is increasingly becoming the lynchpin of delivering data services by connecting the handset to the network and the operators service to the end user
6817090 with success hinged on their ability to develop deploy and react quickly as the data market evolves a clear gap is forming between what the operator aspires to deliver to its users and what it has the resources to develop in a climate driven furiously by the need for innovation and yet limited by resources the gap is widening
6817091 in a recent report from the kelsey group and constat it was revealed that while only 26 percent of us mobile users currently subscribe to a mobile internet service almost 45 percent cite internet capability as a key factor when purchasing their next handset
6817092 the challenge has been laid down for wireless network operators to provide extensive data capabilities and to make them cost competitive for subscribers this is going to put a massive strain on their network infrastructure in the coming months the increased desire for mobile data usage combined with growing pressure to improve and clarify budget management means that a new breed of optimisation tools are required to ensure a balance between data capacity and voice quality while making existing infrastructure work harder and providing justification for investment in new equipment
6817093 we know that children are now using the internet at an increasingly young age
6817094 recent research coupled with feedback from our own youth panel and our work with parents show that children are exploring the online world from as young as five years old
6817095 teachers have asked us for this material because it is never too early to start giving children safety first messages in the same way that we teach small children to cross the road safely there is a need to ensure that young children learn good habits for a future life online
6817096 any initiative which helps to highlight the dangers children face online is a positive step in the right direction ceop has used imagination to devise this programme which we hope will be a success
6817097 the internet has created a whole new world where children are free to come and go as they please they hang out and make friends just as they do in the playground at school we need to wake up to the fact that threats to children online are no less real than in the wider world
6817098 creators have to enjoy freedom of expression but at the same time its an industry that impacts society
6817099 it protects children as games move increasingly online and therefore should be adopted by uk regulators we look forward to discussing this at the forthcoming uk consultation
6817100 pegi has to consider the many different cultural attitudes towards what is and what isnt acceptable pegi is a voluntary system that cannot enforce compliance and indeed four member states of the european union have no existing games rating system at all

6817102 the key challenge for marketers is that the speed of these tools mean that they have to speed up their response time a great example of what happens when you dont do that is how the phorm story has run away from the communications team and fostered a hierarchical community to fight the company
6817103 the most powerful form of promotion is word of mouth if you can get ten people actively talking about an event the chances are you will sell a hundred tickets if you can get a hundred objective ambassadors then you can get a thousand advertising pr and all recognised marketing services are the tools to start these rumour mills but the power lies in the direct contact from consumer to consumer
6817104 i dont think weve quite figured out the perfect solution of how to make money and were working on that thats our highest priority this year
6817105 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6817106 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6817107 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6817108 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in

6817115 niet de seksuele uitstraling maar het goede karakter is in deze job belangrijk af en toe een grapje maken en de dames een leuke tijd bezorgen meer verlangen ze niet we dachten dat we zo snel geld konden verdienen maar nu hebben we er genoeg van en willen we andere mensen waarschuwen voor dit soort wanpraktijken

6817118 we want to restore our historic heritage in the holy land
6817119 responding in part to the russian churchs desire to return to the holy land
6817120 that means the russian state was not automatically entitled to this property
6817121 this may be the case but its an indirect right and as far as i know he is not claiming the property
6817122 it was a marketing move we thought it was a pretty interesting strategy
6817123 the aim was to attract attention the people in the queues told passers by about the iphone
6817124 we couldnt have expected the same kind of fever as in the united states given that apples products arent that well known in poland and in central europe in general
6817125 a total of 38 000 people signed up on our website to be kept up to date about the iphone before the launch

6817130 ik denk niet dat het een moeilijke aanpassing zal worden de bundesliga is een goed kampioenschap en een geweldige leerschool maar in duitsland en ook in belgi al droomde ik alleen maar van de premier league ik vond dat het nu tijd was om de stap te zetten ik heb begrepen dat hughes me vooral als defensieve middenvelder wil uitspelen en dat is ook mijn favoriete positie maar als ik centraal in de verdediging moet spelen doe ik dat zonder morren

6817138 de olympische droom is voorbij we hebben gefaald nu een dag na de race heb ik het nog moeilijk om het een plaats te geven en het zal nog wel een tijdje duren als je 4 jaren naar zon moment toeleeft komen er best wel wat emoties naar boven en ik heb dan ook nu al spijt voor enkele van mijn reacties van boosheid die in de media werden uitvergroot ik had beter moeten weten mijn excuses daarvoor
6817139 ik vind ook dat iedereen mag weten dat ik ontzettend dankbaar ben voor de steun van ontzettend veel mensen mijn coach carlos met zijn doorgedreven motivatie en kennis om het beste in me boven te halen mijn krachttrainer marc en de medische begeleiding mijn mental coach rudy en nog vele anderen die ik hier vergeten ben professioneel nooit eerder voelde ik me op een enorme professionele manier ondersteund en zowel bloso als het boic de vlaamse overheid en enkele belangrijke sponsoren hebben ervoor gezorgd dat alle middelen en mogelijkheden voor een ideale opbouw hiernaartoe werden gegarandeerd ik kan enkel voor mezelf spreken als ik zeg dat mijn omkadering en de instanties al het mogelijke hebben gedaan om hier optimaal te presteren
6817140 maar het is niet gelukt en ik neem mijn verantwoordelijkheid op ik heb gefaald om een succesvol team te vormen met kevin ik vind het dan ook vreselijk dat ik niets heb kunnen terugdoen aan iedereen die zoveel energie en moeite in ons hebben gestoken buiten mijn ouders familie en vrienden wil ik iedereen graag bedanken voor alle berichtjes die ik van velen onder jullie kreeg ik voelde me ontzettend gesteund in de aanloop naar mijn olympische race

6817145 door dit initiatief willen we aantonen dat de europeanen ook de beste zijn op sportief vlak
6817146 europa is al verenigd op commercieel vlak op economisch vlak dus waarom niet op sportief vlak

6817152 we hadden onze kansen beter moeten afmaken na onze eerste match tegen de brazilianen hadden we veel vertrouwen jammer genoeg waren we niet effici nt genoeg een euvel in het hele toernooi hoewel het een grote ontgoocheling is dat we geen medaille haalden was dit toch het toernooi van de bevestiging enkel de match tegen nigeria was minder deze prestatie is hoopvol voor de a ploeg want op de spelen liep heel wat jong belgisch talent rond

6817155 a number of studies show regular physical activity totalling four or more hours per week reduces the risk for breast cancer in post menopausal women
6817156 there hasnt been a study before into pre menopausal women
6817157 there are a number of theories to explain this reduction in risk including the effect of exercise on reducing a womans exposure to estrogen which is known to play a role in the development of breast cancer

6817172 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6817173 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6817174 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6817175 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6817176 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6817177 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6817178 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6817179 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6817180 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call

6817225 in terms of interest rates july was a better time to take out a mortgage so long as you are not looking to sell again in the near future
6817226 but whether we can expect to see mortgage lenders continue this behaviour remains to be seen
6817227 it may well be that lenders are simply testing the waters gauging the response from homebuyers to the new rates if the response is good the rates may well continue to fall and this could help the mortgage market recover as a whole alternatively if there is a change in the lenders circumstances rates could rise again slightly
6817228 typically the lower interest rates come with a higher mortgage arrangement fee and vice versa so this needs to be considered when looking for a mortgage

6817304 were going to be enforcing the same traffic laws for bikes as well as motorists so that both respect each other and the rules of the road as far as bike safety and motor safety
6817305 but were not out here to punish people were out here to change habits
6817306 most people we talk to say that rolling through a stop sign or a light is not that important compared to other things going on

6817332 heavy rain is an adult thriller based on five simple ideas
6817333 you dont watch the story you play it and even generate it you are not only the actor but the writer and the director of the experience
6817334 the characters on screen are not just a bunch of pixels
6817335 they are real living and breathing characters and we do whatever it takes to create a feeling of empathy with them
6817336 we believe that videogames are mature enough to tell more complex stories carrying depth and meaning
6817337 youve seen so many games telling you about rookies going off to the second world war heroes trying to save the world we try to tell a real story thats happening in a real world no supernatural powers no monster to kill just real life
6817338 we believe the challenge should be transferred from the controller to the players mind because this is where the difficulty should be
6817339 we see heavy rain more like an unfolding journey rather than a series of obstacles which have to be set up just to stop the player
6817340 we dont know about the game but we believe we have the most beautiful menu of the show
6817341 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
6817342 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes

6817351 were going to have a very large closed beta almost to the point where every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to it would just be within a closed beta so that we can control the size of it to a degree
6817352 its an interesting difference between a packaged goods product like our previous battlefield games in that there is no real kind of big splash release date where suddenly its available it kind of builds up over time the game will kind of sneak out and before you know it it will be a fairly big game even though were in the closed beta and were not released

6817533 its definitely a possibility because it isnt a negative system
6817534 its really a 4 3 3 that turns into 4 5 1 only when were defending
6817535 i was talking to myself yesterday and thinking about the steep fine and how much it was but the league has to do what it has to do in order to keep the nfl in the right direction it sounds steep and me personally i dont have anything on my record anymore but its the personal conduct policy and you have to abide by it
6817536 most of the actions were fights broken jaws stuff like that
6817537 mine was kind of just disorderly conduct which it was i guess that falls under the personal conduct that fights over theres no winning that battle i go with the rules they set now i get to play monday night pockets are a little lighter but i still get to play
6817538 it was definitely an experience that i dont want to experience again
6817539 id rather go on a more positive note ill tell you that
6817540 i was just trying to get away from it and move on and play football it still ended with the same result i didnt get any charges or anything like that but if i would have fought it and it came back not guilty im sure it wouldve been a different disciplinary action from the nfl

6817549 andy has worked extremely hard during the time i have been at the club and he has earned his place in the first team
6817550 he played a lot of reserve team fixtures during pre season but he kept his head down and worked his way into the side
6817551 andrew was involved with reading and there were more players involved with that it was a good thing for andrew himself because people have seen him and i myself think andrew can play higher in the premier league
6817552 if something came in that i thought was right for us and right for him we would listen to it but circumstances in football change and deano can play right back centre back and midfield so he is a valuable member of our squad
6817553 i think there was a tentative enquiry at chairman level from burnley but i have dismissed that it is not the right time
6817554 so unless someone comes in with a mind blowing offer deano will be staying and i am quite happy to keep him
6817555 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6817556 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support

6817567 i just listen to the song just for the music i dont listen to the lyrics
6817568 1 accept other believers who are weak in faith and dont argue with them about what they think is right or wrong
6817569 perempuan umpama cermin mesti cermat dan halus bila berhadapan dengan mereka
6817570 bagaimanapun kalau dikatakan peranan wang membeli kasih dan sayang ia memang berkait antara satu dengan yang lain namun wang itu sekadar dijadikan sebagai alat dan bukan matlamat wang berperanan menyenangkan pasangan membina rumah tangga mendapatkan sebuah rumah untuk keluarga memiliki kenderaan dan apabila berlaku sebarang bencana wang dapat merungkai masalah yang melingkari jika mengandaikan wang untuk membeli cinta dan mengeratkan kasih dan sayang tandanya kita sudah tersilap menafsir sepatutnya utamakan nilai kasih dan sayang yang diberikan oleh suami atau isteri justeru andai suatu hari kita ditimpa musibah dan hidup dalam serba kekurangan tidaklah cepat melatah cuba perhatikan mereka yang tinggal di kampung ada pasangan yang hidup melarat dan menderita kerana tidak mempunyai wang yang banyak namun ikatan kekeluargaan erat dan sendat dengan kasih dan sayang
6817571 apa yang kamu tidak suka itu adalah yang terbaik untuk kamu
6817572 contohnya pasangan orang tua dahulu masing masing tidak kenal tetapi keluarga aturkan perkahwinan lepas kahwin kita lihat mereka kekal sampai berpuluh puluh tahun dan orang tua tua dakwa cara begitu lebih baik sebenarnya itu bukan formula tetapi kebetulan maklumlah tinggal di kampung pergaulan bukanlah seluas atau semoden golongan yang tinggal di bandar jika berlaku pergaduhan si suami tidak sampai hati menceraikan isteri begitu juga si isteri jika minta cerai pun ke mana diri hendak dibawa
6817573 engkau pergi dan selidiki lagi kerana engkau sebenarnya belum betul kenal kepadanya
6817574 seeloknya ajak dia bermusafir baru tahu kedekut atau tidak berjiran dengannya baru tahu perangai peribadi dan jika berniaga bersama samanya baru tahu amanah atau sebaliknya diri seseorang jika sudah kenal hati budinya barulah boleh dia dijadikan kawan atau saksi begitu juga apabila mencari pasangan selidik dahulu latar belakang dan nilai peribadinya caranya dengan menghantar wakil atau orang tengah yang boleh diharapkan
6817575 cara untuk mengatasi masalah suami yang berubah hati si isteri tidak boleh membentak
6817576 tidak dinafikan apabila si isteri berlembut perangai suami semakin menjadi jadi bagaimanapun cuba kita fikirkan kalau membentak akan timbul pula permusuhan yang berpanjangan silap hari bulan si suami memukul atau mendera si isteri diam isteri bukan bererti redha dan bersetuju dengan perangainya cuma sekasar mana pun lelaki namun jauh disudut hati pasti mempunyai belas kasihan dengan si isteri yang cukup tenang sabar dengan perangainya yang buruk
6817577 ada masanya suami mesti disentak dengan perkara perkara yang tidak dijangka
6817578 seperti kisah seorang pemuda yang menyatakan hasrat mahu berkahwin tetapi dihalang oleh emaknya
6817579 memang susah mencari yang boleh dipercayai tetapi itulah cabaran yang mesti dihadapi
6817580 selain memberi nasihat isteri hendaklah mohon kepada allah dan bermunajat kepada nya tanpa jemu
6817581 apakah selain daripada agama allah mereka cari dan baginya menyerahlah sesiapa yang di langit dan yang di bumi secara sukarela dan terpaksa dan kepadanya jua mereka dikembalikan
6817582 ayat ini hendaklah dibaca sebanyak 1 000 kali sehari apabila hendak digunakan baca tiga kali dan tiup kepada orang yang berkenaan atau ditiupkan ke dalam air untuk diminum oleh orang tersebut mudah mudahan berkat doa dan air itu akan lembut hatinya
6817583 untuk meredakan amalkan surah toha ayat satu hingga enam dan baca sebanyak 1 000 kali
6817584 tha ha hai manusia tiada kami turunkan al quran ini supaya engkau mendapat celaka melainkan peringatan bagi orang yang takut kepada tuhan wahyu yang diturunkan dari tuhan yang menciptakan bumi dan langit yang tinggi tuhan yang pemurah berkuasa di atas singgahsana kepunyaannya apa yang ada dilangit apa yang ada di bumi apa yang ada di antara kedua duanya dan apa yang ada di bawah tanah
6817585 we did the job and we were loading the patient in the back of the ambulance when we heard a cat let out a big meow
6817586 someone said there was a cat on the roof and i looked up and was very surprised to see it was my cat chloe
6817587 the road to oak beach is quite windy and it was lights and sirens all the way
6817588 i cannot believe that she managed to stay on and survive
6817589 as is procedure in these circumstances the case will be reviewed before any decision regarding future action is made
6817590 district court orders remanding cases to the bankruptcy court for further consideration are not ordinarily final orders
6817591 will not deem final a district courts decision remanding to a bankruptcy court for further proceedings if the district court has not certified the decision pursuant to
6817592 e ven if the decision of the bankruptcy court is final a decision by the district court on appeal remanding the bankruptcy courts decision for further proceedings in the bankruptcy court is not final and so is not appealable to this court unless the further proceedings contemplated are of a purely ministerial character
6817593 i dont usually pay attention to the olympics but this year im really into it
6817594 as the frontrunner to become the countrys next president after receiving the support of a key opposition party
6817595 he will keep the federation together and promote harmony as well as national unity
6817596 the way mr zardari handled the issue of president pervez musharrafs resignation is really admirable
6817597 right now the us is keen to allow a more populist figure to come to take charge

6817606 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats
6817607 they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
6817608 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille he has cried out for help lost his grip and fallen to his death
6817609 there are no injuries consistent with that scenario and the information we have is that ahmed fell to his death trying to make his escape rather than being involved in a confrontation with this group
6817610 i think that they the group came here for a specific purpose i do not know what that was but certainly ahmed and his group were sufficiently put on guard to decide to leave
6817611 there are a number of vulnerable children around who are very frightened to be on the streets here
6817612 i cannot explain to you but he was a wonderful boy he was very quiet and friendly with everyone with the family friends and neighbours we just want anyone who witnessed it just let us know if we knew how it happened we could relax and we feel we could leave him in peace we just to want to stop it happening to another person
6817613 his loss is an enormous tragedy for his loving and devoted family he was a happy friendly and generous boy who stayed away from trouble and was a good student
6817614 on the day of his untimely death he was due to receive his gcse results he would have been delighted to discover that his hard work and dedication to his studies had rewarded him with passes in maths and science as well as other subjects
6817615 his 17th birthday would have been on september 1 and this was the day he was due to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at tower hamlets college it is particularly sad that his now lifeless body lies in a mortuary in the very same street where he was due to begin this new chapter in his life
6817616 there was a report that exxon mobil had funneled 16 million from 1998 to 2005 to advocacy organizations in order to cause confusion on the topic of
6817617 i didnt know it was this bad im sorry it is
6817618 i think we have some gaps not to place the blame on anybody i have found there are areas that need attention that have had some historic neglect
6817619 i have to put a pail down to catch the rainwater every time
6817620 and i just have to hope it doesnt rain all night because if it does it overflows
6817621 if a resident has a problem the site managers may say ill get to it
6817622 if residents are intimidated or harassed by a site manager residents can be afraid of them tenants need to let us know and well bring managers in and hold them accountable
6817623 so for instance if a property manager or maintenance supervisor is not telling headquarters about issues whether theyre crime related or complaints we dont know about them
6817624 there was an actual contract but because of a number of issues work got stopped and everybody dropped the ball and no one picked it up
6817625 we are changing managers and relocating managers we are restructuring were remanaging we have key people in the right places and people to be held accountable
6817626 when the contractor found asbestos in the roof it started a saga and the contractor refused to work on the roof
6817627 we may patch them up for now and we will rebid the whole roofing job
6817628 its very distressing that the residents of some of the housing authority developments have to live in these conditions

6817661 the president should begin a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from iraq so that we can meet the many other challenges we face around the world starting with taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan the people who actually attacked us on 9 11
6817662 afghanistan is slipping toward failure the taliban is back violence is up drug production is booming and the afghans are losing faith in their government all the legs of our strategy security counternarcotics efforts reconstruction and governance have gone wobbly if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan
6817663 ever since president bush infamously gazed into mr putins soul in 2001 washington has used photo opportunities as a proxy for a serious russia policy the administration has airbrushed russian belligerence and rebuffed some sensible kremlin proposals such as legally binding extensions to arms control treaties our top priority should be nuclear nonproliferation and arms control including a common approach to iran and the security of russias own weapons and nuclear materials
6817664 every new trade agreement should have built into it e nvironmental standards and labor standards but we talk about it in terms of preserving jobs here but its also about human rights signing an agreement knowing theyre going to exploit workers either by polluting their lungs or their drinking water and or putting them in a position where theyre getting paid a couple bucks a week so it should be a condition to every trade agreement that we engage in
6817665 to those who say the threat is not imminent after 9 11 how long can we afford to wait to those who say regime change is not an appropriate reason for acting i say weapons of mass destruction and the regime of saddam hussein are one and indivisible to remove weapons of mass destruction we must remove that regime to think anything else is to delude ourselves
6817666 we have five times as many troops stationed in iraq as we do in afghanistan currently how do we how do you square that when the threat currently is greater in terms of a terrorist strike from one place and yet were devoting five times of the amount of resources and troops to a different place
6817667 t he continued participation of the russian federation in the group of 8 nations should be conditioned on the russian government voluntarily accepting and adhering to the norms and standards of democracy
6817668 america must commit itself to doing those things that are necessary to succeed in the global marketplace nothing else will do we cannot wall up our country we cannot shut out those with whom we would compete
6817669 our troops are doing a great job over there that doesnt change the fact that the rationale we were given is wrong and we need to have a plausible strategy for withdrawing from iraq and i think that is something that prime minister al maliki has said
6817670 the story of what the united states is accomplishing in afghanistan is remarkable in many ways more noble and less morally and operationally complicated than our efforts in iraq in just a few short years the afghans have written a constitution elected a president and now seated a parliament m ost afghans appreciate what we are doing and want us to stay
6817671 t he goal is to use diplomatic means to get russia to live by the cease fire and if diplomacy is the strategy at this point measured tones is the way to go and i think that kind of balance is what the situation needs
6817672 the only way youll succeed is by being an aggressive competitor rather than trying to hoard your dwindling assets
6817673 well states all over the country are not only missing personnel national guard troops are about 40 percent of the troops on the ground in iraq and afghanistan but were missing the equipment when the troops get deployed the equipment goes with them

6817918 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6817919 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6817920 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6817921 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6817922 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6817923 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6817924 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6817925 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6817926 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call

6817930 georgian authorities do not want alternative voices to be heard
6817931 there are only two kinds of media outlets state owned and oppositional there is no room for other kinds of information
6817932 if i am threatened by someone i always tell the perpetrator that he has the full right to file a libel suit and fight for his rights by legal means they never do
6817933 there are so many things i know but could never report
6817934 i know for sure that i would end up in court
6817935 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

6817937 i fed my orphans with some of the money people paid for using the toilet
6817938 i lost the count of the times i applied to the lanchkhuti municipality asking them for help but the local officials ignored my requests
6817939 unlike the officials local journalists often came to see me they wrote a lot about us but their efforts came to nothing this was the case until iwpr took interest in our problem first we were given clothes and money and then the lanchkhuti administration purchased a flat for my grandchildren
6817940 we only need to be informed weve been cooperating with journalists with pleasure and the story of the pataraia family is a vivid example of this
6817941 pataraias problem was covered extensively by gurias newspapers but only after the institute for war and peace reporting took an interest in it did the local authorities move to help the children sheltered in a toilet

6817950 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6817951 his dedication to his soldiers and his mission was second to none this was his third tour in afghanistan and his reputation for succeeding at any task no matter how difficult was well known
6817952 the engineer corps held a special place in his heart he loved to fix things and help anyone complete their task his work made him happy and his enthusiasm was infectious to all those around him
6817953 his commitment to what was right and just inspired all those that had the privilege of knowing him he let his friends and family know his desire to serve in this mission may that be a comfort to all who mourn him
6817954 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6817955 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6817956 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6817957 i think they are going to it way too many times its the original story that defined john mccain that still when you read it in his book faith of my fathers when you read about it in the nightingales song you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy and i think he wisely for many years stayed away from it as a political tool he really did but now it not only defines him its become a crutch in the campaign and i think he is in danger of trivializing it by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use
6817958 i f you print too much currency it devalues it the mccain campaign is cranking out all these bills with a little mccain as p o w logo on it and is trying to use them to buy their way out of every controversy that comes along pretty soon the mccain teams money wont be good anywhere
6817959 but people just kept dropping them off and dropping them off

6817966 we dont feel that we are firing on full pelt at the moment which isnt bad if we are picking up points
6817967 we feel weve still got a lot more to come
6817968 hopefully we can slowly start to turn the screw and get at a level that we are capable of playing
6817969 they turned us over her last year and we turned them over here at their place so we know its going to be difficult
6817970 under this strategy the time hori zon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi gov ernment and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress

6817985 nothing like this has ever been written about led zeppelin
6817986 the tales of rocknroll excess have been done to death volume i break amp enter seeks to explain how and why led zeppelins music has endured as told by the people who were there watching music history be made
6817987 you dont have to be a led zeppelin fan or scholar to appreciate what this book is about
6817988 franks interviewees describe the venues where led zeppelin played and what it was like to be in the audience hearing them for the very first time some of these people were musicians who shared the bill with zeppelin they offer amazing insights into the band members technical abilities that only other musicians would be aware of then theres the whole hippie counterculture aspect that baby boomers will recall with affection and that this generation will be learning of through eyewitness accounts

6817990 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past
6817991 this was the first series they could not perform i feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade
6817992 to put laxman in that list is not fair since he performed well sourav and rahul although were having it tough but you cannot write them off
6817993 mendis is an exceptional bowler he is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy variety and trajectory nevertheless he has to make sure he continues to improve so that he doesnt become predictable
6817994 generally the carrom ball is bowled with a tennis ball but mendis bowls it with the hard cricket ball which is relatively hard difficult and he ought to be given credit for it even my googly is based on the carrom ball as i bowled a lot of it with the tennis ball
6817995 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6817996 the importance of my religion has increased as i have got older
6817997 i couldnt put a time frame on it but i have found that following the islamic way of life has a lot of beauty to it
6817998 although i was born into a muslim family i wasnt always practising the more i have understood the differences in the various faiths i have adopted as much of islam as possible
6817999 im certainly no saint but the discipline of the islamic way of life has helped my cricket without a doubt i dont drink i pray five times a day which gives stability to my daily routine and i am generally more disciplined about my game and my life
6818000 your profile is built on how the media sees you and i dont try to be somebody i am not
6818001 if i am seen as a quiet guy all well and good but i will just continue to be who i am
6818002 in cricket your circumstances change and it is key to remain constant whether you are up or down i dont intend on putting on an act for anybody this is basically who i am
6818003 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6818004 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6818005 canada needs expertise of indian coaches and test players to help the country in achieving excellence in this game
6818006 ive been through a really rough time in my life and it made the person i am today and made me dive like this
6818007 a dive lasts two seconds and its maybe in total from the start to getting in the water its maybe 10 seconds
6818008 you need to be focused that 10 seconds but in between those 10 seconds you dont need to spend energy its being focused at the right time and not having to be focused at others
6818009 i lost a few pounds not much three or four but i think it made a big difference for me today
6818010 i was a little lighter so it was a little easier for me to make the dives
6818011 she does what she has to do but sometimes shell take the path of least resistance too and weve seen that
6818012 thats why ive felt with her not competing synchro she was going to put everything she had into this event we didnt know how she was going to stand up to the pressure of the event itself and obviously she did
6818013 a lot daily work day by day hour by hour
6818014 i think i just grew up and i think im more mature than i was before
6818015 that helped a lot but i worked a lot on the head part and belief in myself
6818016 even to us were with her every day for years and years shes still an enigma to us
6818017 we dont sort of know what really makes her smile and what doesnt shes so unique and such an individual we just try to go along for the ride as best we can
6818018 overall we know were capable of more but still you want to have a lot of darts to throw at the board and hope a couple hit bullseye

6818024 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6818025 that gave the party control of the house after 40 years in the minority
6818026 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6818027 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back

6818034 our future product offerings will provide customers with value added solutions combining functional ingredients and flavors
6818035 this prototype provides 500 orac units the measurement system used to measure potential antioxidant activity which is the approximate antioxidant equivalent of an average serving of fruits and vegetables
6818036 because these high orac fruit extracts can be bitter and have some other characteristics requiring masking we find it very valuable to be able to deliver a good tasting package right from the start rather than have the customer struggle with making it palatable for their consumer especially children
6818037 it has been proven time and again that taste is critical to compliance with functional foods and drinks
6818038 die hard supplement users may still be willing to swallow some less than optimal tasting products for the promise of health benefits but the average mainstream consumer will not
6818039 we feel if we can make functional foods a positive experience for consumers the category will grow even more which will benefit participants and consumers alike
6818040 in overcoming bitter burning astringent chalky salty metallic tastes and a host of other off flavors and off notes
6818041 a key question related to treatment with curcumin is its poor bioavailability after being taken orally our results also indicated that only low levels of curcumin are detectable in plasma steady state level at day 3 is f22 41 ng ml
6818042 nevertheless some of the patients had biological activity of curcumin as evidenced by the anti tumor effects in two patients and by effects on cytokine levels and on nf nb cox 2 and pstat
6818043 further investigations are needed to elucidate the relationship between the form of curcumin its relative pharmacologic activity and circulating versus tumor tissue levels
6818044 our current study shows that oral curcumin is tolerated without toxicity at doses of 8 g d for up to 18 months although this molecule is poorly absorbed with low nanogram levels of circulating curcumin detected at steady state biological activity is evident preclinical data suggest that curcumin has potent activity against pancreatic cancer but higher levels of exposure need to be achieved

6818105 go tell your mommy that daddy needs to type a letter
6818106 tell your daddy that he cant type a letter right now cause there is a red ribbon in the typewriter
6818107 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress is very encouraging
6818108 its always an interesting engineering challenge whenever you arrive at a new circuit and today in valencia was no exception we spent two very productive sessions concentrating on tyre choice while running appropriate fuel levels lewis and heikki also performed faultlessly allowing us to collect plenty of valuable data which we will go through tonight
6818109 the gap on the bridge was completely no problem it was overconcern by me
6818110 charlie said that the gap in kerbs are much bigger than the gap on the bridge so anyway he said wait and see and it has all been okay at the moment the tyres have no problem no damage so we are very happy
6818111 its very important to create a gap ahead if you want a clear lap you cant see ahead around the corners because theyre all blind
6818112 some drivers just back up into you they take advantage of the fact they have a small gap behind them and dont care about whos following
6818113 they back up into you because theyre trying to create a gap for themselves but that compromises your fast lap
6818114 weve had a good day apart from one little spin and i think weve started on the right foot weve slowly increased our pace and got though the testing programme
6818115 the whole track is pretty much fine the two long straights give you time to cool your tyres then there are slower corners which demand you get your braking right it is a tricky circuit
6818116 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job today it was important that we find a good base setup immediately and we managed to do that
6818117 it was a good day we worked well and acquired a lot of data from this track which over the next few hours will be used to prepare ourselves as well as possible for this weekend from what we could see given the usual unknowns on a friday we can say we are competitive whether we will be competitive enough to reach our target will only be revealed starting with tomorrow afternoons qualifying
6818118 overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying
6818119 the setup we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6818120 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known
6818121 yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
6818122 they have really done a good job today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6818123 the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect
6818124 i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job
6818125 today it was important that we find a good base setup immediately and we managed to do that
6818126 olympische spelen zijn de europeanen masochisten of gewoonweg de beste zonder dat ze het weten
6818127 door dit initiatief willen we aantonen dat de europeanen ook de beste zijn op sportief vlak
6818128 europa is al verenigd op commercieel vlak op economisch vlak dus waarom niet op sportief vlak
6818129 we willen de verschillende nationale delegaties dan ook niet vervangen door een europese delegatie we willen simpelweg de dubbele identiteit nationaal europees aanmoedigen en tonen dat we geen reden hebben om jaloers te zijn op de resultaten van de amerikanen of de chinezen

6818135 we willen geen enkel risico nemen de scheuren zijn duidelijk aan het verdiepen mede onder invloed van het zwaar verkeer bij omwonenden zijn nog geen problemen vastgesteld aan de huizen er is ook geen gevaar voor een instorting van de oever

6818138 een aanmoediging voor onze landgenoten die op deze olympische spelen nog hun wedstrijden moeten afwerken
6818139 deze medaille is het resultaat van gedreven teamwerk naar deze titel heeft de belgische estafetteploeg lange tijd toe gewerkt de zilveren medaille is niet alleen een beloning voor hun eigen inspanningen maar ook de kroon op het werk voor alle belgische atleten op de olympische spelen evenals voor hun begeleiders en al degenen die hen omringen
6818140 hoewel dit nog maar de eerste belgische medaille is zette ons land in de breedte al een puik resultaat neer in peking de belgische delegatie was in meer sporten vertegenwoordigd dan vroeger heel wat belgische records sneuvelden en veel jonge belgen legden nu al een stevige basis voor de toekomst
6818141 het is voor hen een beloning voor de vele inspanningen en voor de keuze voor investeringen in de lange termijn
6818142 het is een groot moment in de belgische atletiekgeschiedenis waar we terecht trots mogen op zijn bovendien is het voor kim gevaert een prachtige afsluiter van een rijke en boeiende professionele sportcarri re

6818151 het enthousiasme van hughes was doorslaggevend in mijn beslissing om voor deze club te kiezen
6818152 het is belangrijk te weten dat de manager je echt wil ik weet nu al dat ik van de engelse mentaliteit houd van de manier van spelen en de manier van leven
6818153 ik denk niet dat het een moeilijke aanpassing zal worden de bundesliga is een goed kampioenschap en een geweldige leerschool maar in duitsland en ook in belgi al droomde ik alleen maar van de premier league ik vond dat het nu tijd was om de stap te zetten ik heb begrepen dat hughes me vooral als defensieve middenvelder wil uitspelen en dat is ook mijn favoriete positie maar als ik centraal in de verdediging moet spelen doe ik dat zonder morren

6818157 i could be wrong but i bet he picks romney
6818158 he energizes the base romney was clearly the no 2 pick and would excite a lot of traditional republicans who think mccain is too much of a maverick
6818159 these voters will also get behind the ticket because win or lose they will see it as a setup for romney in 2012 most republicans have barely heard about most of the other names that have been bandied about they all know romney second romney is the most reaganesque of the bunch and the party is searching for any way it can find to get back to the winning days of the reagan approach hes a former governor like reagan who has ruled over a population more liberal than he is and he did it well third mccain needs an economic conservative to burnish his credentials on restoring health back to the economy romney fits there fourth romney is already vetted he communicates and campaigns well will do what hes told tirelessly he has been campaigning forcefully for mccain fifth he looks and acts like he could be president and thats 95 percent of the job of a credible vp candidate and sixth and most importantly mccain needs to nail colorado mormons and michigan home state for sure as they are in the top four critical swing states romney fits both bills
6818160 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6818161 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6818162 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6818163 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6818164 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field

6818169 they are going to have to pay up to get an agreement from this membership a lot of our members have it in their gut that its payback time
6818170 this company is acting like a company that is in bankruptcy
6818171 the company needs to get serious and come forward with serious proposals and not just talk
6818172 we have about a week thats not much time to dance around the issues
6818173 we will have good conversations with the union about that this next week
6818174 the company has had record profits and a huge backlog
6818175 if florida really focused on this endeavor on bringing all the products of puerto rico to florida
6818176 florida will have a superb new infusion of taxes and commerce it has never seen before we are already here
6818177 its going to be a wonderful opportunity to let the community know we are here
6818178 the size of the puerto rican market has been underestimated and very much misused because they put us in the latino market
6818179 i want people to have a taste of what we can do
6818180 behind the business model is that these are functions you dont need 100 percent of the time if you have full staffing of those functions you need to pay for the infrastructure
6818181 we like the governor and respect him immensely but on this one we think hes wrong
6818182 in our view the healthy families act is not only workable but absolutely necessary for the 2 2 million ohioans without paid sick days who work hard play by the rules and dont want to lose a job or a paycheck simply because they or their family members occasionally get sick
6818183 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it
6818184 we have a popular governor and strong legislative leaders that are all now united and we have a united business community
6818185 it will increase the dynamics of our ability to message to voters
6818186 i am a big advocate of having paid sick leave
6818187 i thank god had sick days and my family had sick days when i had a stroke so they were able to come take care of me i understand the value of it from a human side
6818188 avoid portraying ohio as unfriendly to business and economic development
6818189 the governor need not fear that our campaign will portray ohio as unfriendly to business our goal is to make ohio friendlier to working families
6818190 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
6818191 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies

6818204 one of the options we would seriously consider is that we would possibly
6818205 if we cant have a competitive proposal there doesnt seem to be a lot of value in us going through this process if the best we can do is come up with a proposal that falls short of what the department of defense is looking for

6818212 they say martinis are like womens breasts three is too many one is not enough
6818213 no no i go to the movies but i dont buy movie companies i mean im always interested in understanding the math of things and understanding as much as i can about all aspects of business
6818214 and what i learn today may be useful to me two years from now i mean if i understand the tar sands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen ive got that filed away and i can use it at some later date
6818215 because you could be the worlds greatest mining engineer but if you were wrong about the price of oil in a big way it would negate all that knowledge
6818216 so i can tell you that if you had 120 oil from now till you know 50 years from now that the tar sands would work out very well but i dont know the answer to that

6818218 nabi shallallaahu alaihi wasallam tidak pernah meninggalkan doa ini ketika pagi dan sore hari
6818219 wahai abbas paman rasulullah mintalah afiat di dunia dan akhirat
6818220 rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wasallam menempatkan pamannya pada posisi bapaknya dan beliau melihat hak pamannya sebagaimana hak seorang anak kepada orang tuanya dalam pengkhususan beliau dengan sekedar menyuruh pamannya memohon afiat memberikan lecutan motivasi untuk senantiasa membaca doa yang agung ini untuk bertawassul kepada alloh dengannya dan meminta perlindungan dalam semua urusan
6818221 mintalah kepada allah ampunan dan afiat sesungguhnya seseorang tidaklah dianugerahi setelah keyakinan yang lebih baik dari afiat

6818242 unser schwerpunkt wird wie in den zur ckliegenden jahren nicht nur auf highlights aus den bekannten filmhochburgen liegen
6818243 so lange ich hier direktor bin wird es keinen filmwettbewerb auf der viennale geben davon gibt es in europa genug
6818244 einen politischen oder traurigen film zu machen ist sicher viel einfacher als eine gut gemachte kom die leider trauen sich viel zu wenige regisseure in letzter zeit an dieses genre heran
6818245 er hat ein gesp r f r gute kom dien deshalb haben wir ihn auch als spezial gast nach wien eingeladen
6818246 speziell ber dylan werden wir eine vielzahl an werken zeigen die es in dieser art und weise der komposition noch nie gegeben hat
6818247 ich habe einfach keinen zugang zu diesen filmen mir fehlt zudem die kulturelle verbindung zu indien und die viennale ist ja nicht das einzige filmfestival es gibt sicher gen gend andere passende pl tze wo filme aus bollywood gezeigt werden k nnen
6818248 ich finde es nat rlich sch n wenn hollywoodgr en nach wien kommen und wir arbeiten auch daran aber es ist f r mich nicht das wichtigste
6818249 das gro e problem dabei ist die tatsache dass die medikamente eigentlich bei schweren k rperlichen leiden eingesetzt werden und ihre wirksamkeit verlieren
6818250 eine rotalgenart bildet beispielsweise unter uv strahlung weniger rote lichtsammlerproteine und vermindert so die strahlungsabsorption die typische rote farbe der alge verschwindet dann und die pflanze bekommt wei e spitzen
6818251 normalerweise f ngt die ozonschicht einen gro teil der energiereichen kurzwelligen und sch dlichen uv strahlung der sonne ab
6818252 die abnahme der stratosph rischen ozonkonzentration vor allem ber den polargebieten lassen die gef hrlichen strahlen bis ins meer eindringen
6818253 als u erst empfindlich erwiesen sich die sporen und keimzellen der algen die als einzeller im wasser treiben
6818254 unsere untersuchungen zeigen dass die verbreitung bestimmter braunalgenarten durch das uv strahlungsklima begrenzt wird erh ht sich die uv strahlung werden die algen in tiefere wasserschichten verdr ngt
6818255 zielgerichtete individuell angepasste und automatisierte kommunikation zwischen fahrzeugen und der stra e werden den verkehr in naher zukunft sicherer machen
6818256 hierbei st tzt sich das system einerseits auf bereits vorhandene daten wie beispielsweise informationen aus verkehrsleitzentralen andererseits sollen neue m glichkeiten zur datensammlung umgesetzt werden
6818257 bei floating car data werden informationen ausgewertet die vom steuerrechner eines autos kommen beispielsweise wenn der fahrer die bremse bet tigt
6818258 der konsument w nscht sich produkte von denen er wei woher sie kommen frische sowie regionale qualit t in der lebensmittelwirtschaft sind von zentraler bedeutung
6818259 illegale raubkopien f gen der digitalen unterhaltungsindustrie j hrliche verluste von hunderten mio euro zu hinzu kommt ein entsprechender entgang an steuereinnahmen und die systematische verletzung des gewerberechts
6818260 es ist eine absolute fehleinsch tzung dass die problematik der online piraterie nur hollywood produktionen betrifft
6818261 der film hat bisher rund 19 mio dollar eingespielt gesch tzte zwei mio dollar gehen dabei durch piraterie verloren
6818262 hier ist die politik gefordert sie muss eine rechtliche grundlage f r den kampf gegen online piraterie zur verf gung stellen
6818263 wenn einnahmen wegfallen ist das ein harter einschnitt in die finanzsituation der filmwirtschaft mit der konsequenz dass viele produktionsfirmen ums berleben k mpfen m ssen
6818264 unser l ngerfristiges ziel ist es mit den gr er angelegten filmproduktionen einen st rkeren vorteil aus dem globalen kinomarkt zu ziehen
6818265 filme aus unserer dc abteilung haben gegen ber anderen produktionen den vorteil dass sie sich hervorragend daf r einsetzen lassen auch andere bereiche unseres unternehmens wie die games sparte zu unterst tzen
6818266 superman hat als film nicht in der art und weise funktioniert wie wir uns das vorgestellt haben das hat aber zum teil sicher auch daran gelegen dass wir den helden charakter im film nicht richtig positioniert haben
6818267 soweit es die charaktere zulassen werden wir versuchen die d sterheit der superhelden weiter zu erforschen

6818278 i cant ignore the only evidence and there was no contradictory evidence
6818279 it would be difficult for him to exist in prison
6818280 i have lived in america since 1980 and i dont like the fact that i cant vote im gonna register to vote
6818281 im republican and im casting my vote for john mccain for president
6818282 she was captain of our junior varsity team last year a tremendous leader
6818283 great business for firemen or fire inspector that wish to retire 200000 staten island
6818284 its a great honor for us to win afghanistans first medal for the olympics
6818285 to win for me this bronze medal is bigger than gold
6818286 it is really amazing for me and for the country
6818287 togo has given the maximum for our delegation so the delegation has had a very good ambience and that helped me win
6818288 i cant really imagine what they will do when i return to togo
6818289 its the first time togo is being recognized for being really good in sports they are very happy
6818290 we are very proud of this achievement and we hope this will mark a new era in bahrains sports
6818291 our target in these olympic games is to be the best among the arabic competitors
6818292 our goal is to build a new generation of athletics in bahrain
6818293 we had the hope to win but we didnt know for sure it would be possible but when our hopes came true we were very very happy
6818294 we do our best to bring peace to afghanistan through sports
6818295 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6818296 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6818297 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6818298 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6818299 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6818300 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry
6818301 in a way that is still true its just that instead of a few dozen cottages there turn out to be tens of thousands
6818302 i was drawn to write about gold farming due to my perception that its a significant phenomenon that academics and development organisations are unaware of
6818303 the indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400 000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900 000
6818304 nonetheless the two are still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
6818305 or at least the edges of a digital underworld populated by scammers and hackers and pornographers and which has spread to the
6818306 when you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet
6818307 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6818308 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6818309 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6818310 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6818311 pista divertente noi siamo veloci e possiamo fare di pi
6818312 in linea generale direi che un bel posto dove divertente guidare ha detto liridato dopo le prove la giornata andata bene e possiamo essere anche pi forti e migliorare ulteriormente direi che abbiamo lavorato davvero bene qui bisogna essere veloci ovunque e noi siamo molto veloci le cose non vanno male ma possiamo fare sicuramente ancora meglio
6818313 un circuito totalmente nuovo ha detto il brasiliano tutti iniziamo da zero divertente perch vedi gli altri piloti migliorare ogni volta in pista vedi i tempi scendere tantissimo in 10 minuti tutto molto interessante
6818314 su una pista sporca cos devi fare un giro pulito senza strafare perch facile sbagliare e perdere dei decimi devi fare tutto in modo giusto se ci saranno sorprese non lo so difficile saperlo sicuramente si inizia da zero
6818315 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6818316 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6818317 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6818318 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6818319 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6818320 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6818321 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6818322 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6818323 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6818324 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6818325 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6818326 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6818327 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6818328 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6818329 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6818330 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6818331 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6818332 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6818333 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6818334 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6818335 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6818336 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6818337 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6818338 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6818339 chris brauns has done a magnificent job in helping us understand the true nature of biblical forgiveness every christian will profit from reading and applying this book
6818340 a nutter will step out of the crowd with a big knife
6818341 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6818342 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6818343 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6818344 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6818345 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6818346 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6818347 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6818348 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6818349 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6818350 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6818351 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6818352 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6818353 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6818354 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6818355 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6818356 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6818357 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6818358 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6818359 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6818360 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6818361 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6818362 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6818363 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6818364 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6818365 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6818366 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6818367 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6818368 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6818369 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6818370 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6818371 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6818372 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6818373 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6818374 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6818375 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6818376 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6818377 who are open to doing something on the production side
6818378 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6818379 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6818380 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6818381 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6818382 unless masaba repents within four days and take only four wives from the herd he remains condemned to death according to sharia law
6818383 any muslim who married more than the approved number of wives at a time either by mistake or out of ignorance is instructed to choose but only four and ask for allahs forgiveness
6818384 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6818385 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6818386 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6818387 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6818388 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6818389 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6818390 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6818391 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6818392 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6818393 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6818394 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6818395 sua santit ha espresso la sua preoccupazione per la situazione che regna oggigiorno in tibet contemporaneamente ai giochi olimpici
6818396 unautorit morale che non potr ottenere se non indirizzandosi verso la democrazia
6818397 ci auguriamo che la francia rispetter le preoccupazioni della cina e tratter in maniera prudente le questioni importanti e sensibili
6818398 the president should begin a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from iraq so that we can meet the many other challenges we face around the world starting with taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan the people who actually attacked us on 9 11
6818399 afghanistan is slipping toward failure the taliban is back violence is up drug production is booming and the afghans are losing faith in their government all the legs of our strategy security counternarcotics efforts reconstruction and governance have gone wobbly if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan
6818400 ever since president bush infamously gazed into mr putins soul in 2001 washington has used photo opportunities as a proxy for a serious russia policy the administration has airbrushed russian belligerence and rebuffed some sensible kremlin proposals such as legally binding extensions to arms control treaties our top priority should be nuclear nonproliferation and arms control including a common approach to iran and the security of russias own weapons and nuclear materials
6818401 every new trade agreement should have built into it e nvironmental standards and labor standards but we talk about it in terms of preserving jobs here but its also about human rights signing an agreement knowing theyre going to exploit workers either by polluting their lungs or their drinking water and or putting them in a position where theyre getting paid a couple bucks a week so it should be a condition to every trade agreement that we engage in
6818402 to those who say the threat is not imminent after 9 11 how long can we afford to wait to those who say regime change is not an appropriate reason for acting i say weapons of mass destruction and the regime of saddam hussein are one and indivisible to remove weapons of mass destruction we must remove that regime to think anything else is to delude ourselves
6818403 we have five times as many troops stationed in iraq as we do in afghanistan currently how do we how do you square that when the threat currently is greater in terms of a terrorist strike from one place and yet were devoting five times of the amount of resources and troops to a different place
6818404 t he continued participation of the russian federation in the group of 8 nations should be conditioned on the russian government voluntarily accepting and adhering to the norms and standards of democracy
6818405 america must commit itself to doing those things that are necessary to succeed in the global marketplace nothing else will do we cannot wall up our country we cannot shut out those with whom we would compete
6818406 our troops are doing a great job over there that doesnt change the fact that the rationale we were given is wrong and we need to have a plausible strategy for withdrawing from iraq and i think that is something that prime minister al maliki has said
6818407 the story of what the united states is accomplishing in afghanistan is remarkable in many ways more noble and less morally and operationally complicated than our efforts in iraq in just a few short years the afghans have written a constitution elected a president and now seated a parliament m ost afghans appreciate what we are doing and want us to stay
6818408 t he goal is to use diplomatic means to get russia to live by the cease fire and if diplomacy is the strategy at this point measured tones is the way to go and i think that kind of balance is what the situation needs
6818409 the only way youll succeed is by being an aggressive competitor rather than trying to hoard your dwindling assets
6818410 well states all over the country are not only missing personnel national guard troops are about 40 percent of the troops on the ground in iraq and afghanistan but were missing the equipment when the troops get deployed the equipment goes with them

6818627 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6818628 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6818629 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6818630 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6818631 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6818632 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6818633 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp

6818717 the very changes that are taking place in the concept of privacy will be a matter that parliaments have to address and courts
6818718 the widespread availability of communications technologies that allow individuals to publish information about themselves that can be accessed by others is unprecedented in our society

6818820 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6818821 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6818822 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6818823 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6818824 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6818825 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp

6818888 the institute for ocean conservation science will provide a whole new capacity for somas to address questions that will improve public policy to benefit residents of new york state and beyond
6818889 our oceans are in a state of emergency and need immediate help

6818892 it is obvious that species and their habitats are interconnected but those connections have too often been ignored to the detriment of marine life
6818893 for many years somas focused research on marine resource management issues through its living marine resources institute limri the establishment of the institute for ocean conservation science will strengthen our commitment to solving urgent environmental problems
6818894 we are thrilled to welcome the institute as an important new part of our university

6818898 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines

6818901 society is like a stew if you dont stir it up every now and then the scum rises to the top
6818902 art is the imposing of a pattern on experience and our aesthetic enjoyment is recognition of the pattern
6818903 dont limit a child to your own learning for he was born in another time
6818904 when women are depressed they either eat or go shopping men invade another country
6818905 the end he the artist strives for is something else than a perfectly executed print his aim is to depict dreams ideas or problems in such a way that other people can observe and consider them
6818906 the president should begin a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from iraq so that we can meet the many other challenges we face around the world starting with taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan the people who actually attacked us on 9 11
6818907 afghanistan is slipping toward failure the taliban is back violence is up drug production is booming and the afghans are losing faith in their government all the legs of our strategy security counternarcotics efforts reconstruction and governance have gone wobbly if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan
6818908 ever since president bush infamously gazed into mr putins soul in 2001 washington has used photo opportunities as a proxy for a serious russia policy the administration has airbrushed russian belligerence and rebuffed some sensible kremlin proposals such as legally binding extensions to arms control treaties our top priority should be nuclear nonproliferation and arms control including a common approach to iran and the security of russias own weapons and nuclear materials
6818909 every new trade agreement should have built into it e nvironmental standards and labor standards but we talk about it in terms of preserving jobs here but its also about human rights signing an agreement knowing theyre going to exploit workers either by polluting their lungs or their drinking water and or putting them in a position where theyre getting paid a couple bucks a week so it should be a condition to every trade agreement that we engage in
6818910 to those who say the threat is not imminent after 9 11 how long can we afford to wait to those who say regime change is not an appropriate reason for acting i say weapons of mass destruction and the regime of saddam hussein are one and indivisible to remove weapons of mass destruction we must remove that regime to think anything else is to delude ourselves
6818911 we have five times as many troops stationed in iraq as we do in afghanistan currently how do we how do you square that when the threat currently is greater in terms of a terrorist strike from one place and yet were devoting five times of the amount of resources and troops to a different place
6818912 t he continued participation of the russian federation in the group of 8 nations should be conditioned on the russian government voluntarily accepting and adhering to the norms and standards of democracy
6818913 america must commit itself to doing those things that are necessary to succeed in the global marketplace nothing else will do we cannot wall up our country we cannot shut out those with whom we would compete
6818914 our troops are doing a great job over there that doesnt change the fact that the rationale we were given is wrong and we need to have a plausible strategy for withdrawing from iraq and i think that is something that prime minister al maliki has said
6818915 the story of what the united states is accomplishing in afghanistan is remarkable in many ways more noble and less morally and operationally complicated than our efforts in iraq in just a few short years the afghans have written a constitution elected a president and now seated a parliament m ost afghans appreciate what we are doing and want us to stay
6818916 t he goal is to use diplomatic means to get russia to live by the cease fire and if diplomacy is the strategy at this point measured tones is the way to go and i think that kind of balance is what the situation needs
6818917 the only way youll succeed is by being an aggressive competitor rather than trying to hoard your dwindling assets
6818918 well states all over the country are not only missing personnel national guard troops are about 40 percent of the troops on the ground in iraq and afghanistan but were missing the equipment when the troops get deployed the equipment goes with them

6818928 im not sure how this discriminates against the homeless it just keeps the sidewalks clear for what they were intended walking

6818974 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6818975 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6818976 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6818977 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6818978 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field

6818983 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6818984 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6818985 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6818986 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6818987 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6818988 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6818989 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6818990 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6818991 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6818992 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
6818993 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6818994 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6818995 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6818996 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6818997 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6818998 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6818999 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6819000 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6819001 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6819002 if you trust every web site but not a government
6819003 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6819004 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6819005 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6819006 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6819007 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6819008 having a child is now the single best indicator of financial collapse
6819009 the winners as a result of beijing are the seven sponsors
6819010 the value of the local sponsorship for 2012 is much greater now than it was three or four weeks ago because of the performance of the team the reaction has been electric they have done a good deal
6819011 i joked after the ceremony that we should withdraw but london will do it in its own way
6819012 the big issue we have is to make a decision about whether this is really important the government has to make a decision boris has to make a decision we have to talk about the resources the money the time and the effort
6819013 look at what team gb has done people devoted money resources time discipline and focus its the only way it will happen
6819014 everything in china is about scale and the implied power that scale gives you
6819015 when an advertising agency improves often the perception takes time to catch up with the reality its the same with the opening ceremony it reinforced the perception is now the reality
6819016 those of us who have invested in china know how strong the economy has been in the last 20 or so years the ceremony brought home to the world in a very graphic way the shift in power
6819017 there are now two basic superpowers we may look back on the beijing olympics as the time the western world woke up to china
6819018 las operaciones de ingreso al y salida del territorio nacional de divisas
6819019 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6819020 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6819021 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6819022 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6819023 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6819024 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6819025 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6819026 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6819027 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6819028 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6819029 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6819030 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6819031 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6819032 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6819033 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6819034 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6819035 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6819036 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6819037 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6819038 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6819039 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6819040 i always knew him to be a conscientious and hardworking police officer
6819041 i was confident in his abilities he served in several capacities as he worked his way through the police department through various investigative roles
6819042 had a confrontation with people he arrested in terms of fighting and difficulty
6819043 whenever you hear about an officer injured in the line of duty
6819044 you cringe because you realize the problems that they will have to face as they go through recovery
6819045 problems not only in their attempt to return to duty but in how it affects them at home

6819063 was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it
6819064 if mikes right the pumas are going to burn down the pepsi center
6819065 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6819066 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6819067 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6819068 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6819069 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6819070 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6819071 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6819072 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6819073 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6819074 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6819075 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6819076 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6819077 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6819078 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6819079 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6819080 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6819081 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6819082 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6819083 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6819084 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6819085 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6819086 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6819087 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6819088 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6819089 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6819090 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
6819091 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6819092 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6819093 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
6819094 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6819095 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6819096 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6819097 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6819098 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6819099 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6819100 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6819101 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6819102 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has
6819103 edwards was one of the few democrats whose background was checked by obamas campaign
6819104 in the list of considerations there should be somebody from the house of representatives
6819105 a person that many of us think would be a good person to be in the mix
6819106 just in case any just in case anyone especially say a guy whose last name is obama wanted to read about his qualifications

6819217 management implied that it is happy with the companys business model during the call and several of our competitors reiterated buy ratings and valuations at 20x or more next years earnings maybe we just dont get it but then again maybe we do

6819226 there is also a division of persona in the way the writer is perceived the discrepancy between the effects of his books and the impression he makes when the reader gets to talk to him or listen to him it has to be admitted that there will often be an element of disappointment here the best of us goes into the book we are not with some rare and spectacular exceptions so brilliant or wise or witty as might have been hoped or expected far from it and perhaps the lure of readings and talks and panels and all these public forums is simply a doomed desire to live up to the promise to not disappoint

6819318 the education health and welfare spending that democrats champion increased only slightly if at all
6819319 but privately and publicly republican leaders are demanding that either spending be cut except the spending they advocate or money be borrowed from local governments transportation accounts or other programs to close the gap

6819325 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained and you are registered then you should be able to carry a weapon matter of fact theres a lot of instances that would have saved a lot of lives
6819326 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man

6819368 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6819369 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6819370 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6819371 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6819372 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6819373 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6819374 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6819381 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6819382 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6819383 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her

6819388 the biggest buyout firms are used to gaming the system to turn a profit its no surprise they want special rules now to take over another sector of our economy
6819389 working families who get up and go to work everyday are struggling to stay afloat in our economy and they need higher standards and stable banks not backroom regulations that subsidize risky behavior by profiteering buyout firms

6819395 this is so much more than a construction project for us
6819396 this is an opportunity for our partnership of companies to engage in an event thats of incredible significance to the denver community
6819397 our resolve as a union is not going to change unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6819398 gene and i have been through so much together the same words can come out of each others mouth thats going to be my guide
6819399 shock disbelief i could not believe the words i was hearing
6819400 i had a chance to see him four maybe six weeks ago he looked healthy he didnt show any signs that this could be a problem
6819401 he was like a father figure having been a player and then fighting for our benefits and rights as players every time id see him it was like seeing one of the family always a very authentic moment its just a sad day for the nfl
6819402 i never saw him tired he never missed a game he had played tough and through all of the battles with the union he never blinked he never let anybody see him sweat
6819403 he was so strong willed ill bet he convinced himself that it was nothing more than a bug
6819404 right now its too early to speculate on any of that
6819405 personally all i want is for gene to be properly memorialized
6819406 i have been witness to other reps broach this subject with gene and past executive committee members
6819407 and the issue garnered zero traction toward a satisfactory answer
6819408 i honestly believe the intent of the e mail was to find a successor when the time is right
6819409 you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6819410 there was so much misinformation built up over the years it becomes the truth to some people
6819411 it caught up with him but it also speaks to his one blind spot he was too proud to beat his chest or sell his accomplishments
6819412 i look at your track record and judge a tree by its fruit
6819413 look at the labor deal we have and i dont think the players are against it
6819414 our resolve as a union is not going to change
6819415 unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6819416 he was not only my leader and my mentor but one of the best friends ive ever had thats why this is so emotional were obviously dealing on a day to day basis while we go through the grieving process
6819417 the second estimate clearly increases the already strong chances that the economy will fall into recession over the coming quarters things will be considerably worse in 2009
6819418 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6819419 extendicare facilities sound warm and fuzzy on paper the type of place that you would want your parents or grandparents to be if they needed care you couldnt provide them yourself
6819420 the reality is that these facilities have a long record of excessive and repeated citations by the washington department of social and health services for providing substandard care and care that violates the rights of residents
6819421 basically we believe that extendicares corporate strategy and policy is to maximize profits at the expense of the elderly and vulnerable people it claims to serve
6819422 we all know that there is a direct correlation between elder abuse and staffing levels in my opinion the extendicare facilities in washington are elder abuse cases waiting to happen its just a matter of whose parents or grandparents are going to be the victims
6819423 the independent members of baker tilly international desire to develop the brand worldwide and as the largest u s member firm virchow krause became the logical choice to carry the brand in the u s discussions ensued and virchow krause was extremely interested in pursuing this opportunity
6819424 the world is becoming smaller and many of our current clients and the new clients were engaging are involved in international commerce representing the baker tilly global brand in the u s will strengthen our ability to provide clients with seamless resources and benefits as they develop business abroad
6819425 the firm has extensive international capabilities in house but the common international brand will greatly reduce the confusion that often occurs when collaborating with other independent member firms throughout the world to serve client needs
6819426 doing business internationally is the future now more and more our clients and companies throughout our geographic market are increasing their investments in foreign markets
6819427 gene was a leader mentor and friend to me and many others throughout his lifetime today is a sad day for all those who knew him as gene would have wanted the nfl players association will continue to move forward in making the nfl the greatest professional sports league in the country

6819432 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force has not subsided
6819433 the definitive authority of indian gaming is the federal agency the bureau of indian affairs bia which is under the auspices of the department of interior they have told us that since there is no federally recognized tribe or tribal land in ohio there is no possibility of any tribal gaming in ohio we have also consulted experts in the field of indian gaming to verify all facts
6819434 our approach has always been to be open and honest about this project from disclosure of our partners at lakes entertainment to clearly letting the voters know that this is a full scale casino our intent is to always respond to any questions or misinformation about this issue our facility will be built with private sector dollars and will be the largest private investment in ohio in the 21st century with no tax abatements or credits we are proud of this fact
6819435 further ohios general assembly and governor would have to pass a law with majorities in both houses to approve any tribal petition this has been tried multiple times over the years and because there are no federally recognized tribes in ohio has failed only by an act of the legislature could the state recognize a tribe in ohio and in 205 years that has not happened and will not happen
6819436 the data was weak but not as weak as some had expected and it boosts expectations that the bank of england is going to cut interest rates when headline inflation comes under control

6819439 our three seat vroom had become too small so we made the logical progression to elluminate voffice
6819440 the communication and collaboration are exactly the same if not better than face to face with no extra overhead or infrastructure to worry about and i have the ability to employ the best people wherever they are plus elluminate is just as effective for meeting with clients and prospects
6819441 elluminate is thrilled to be experiencing such an overwhelming response from the marketplace for these new products
6819442 we believe this is validation of our decision to expand our product line in two directions making it simple for anyone to deliver engaging online sessions and distribute post session content with elluminate next gt as well as to allow entry level users to experience the benefits of real time web collaboration with elluminate voffice and vclass

6819451 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6819452 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6819453 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here

6819465 we are heading to a 3000 gold price in conservative terms since the problems in the untied states are insurmountable unfixable without any remedy the only real life solution will be a more visible totalitarian state complete with rationing if you believe rationing will not happen just look at the crack spread the difference between the oil price and gasoline price it is rising dangerously crimping energy firm profits unless the gasoline price rises by 50 cents we are certain to face shortages lines to buy gasoline and fights next come riots in fact job loss home foreclosure food prices gasoline shortages and bank runs will likely be the basis of social chaos in the next two years one will not be capable of recognizing the us landscape in ten years maybe five years the whole world will be watching

6819478 when i look at myself and the success i have accomplished since college and compare it with my college buddies i think
6819479 for my job search i applied at finance companies jp morgan goldman sachs
6819480 the people i met from emc were the key draw for me i also saw financial stability a global company and opportunities cross functional opportunities the ability to meet people and go to other places
6819481 i never thought of it sales as appealing the culture and the people sold me
6819482 after my internship in 2006 i started here full time in september of 2007 as a sales associate i am currently preparing for my next role as back up recovery and archiving specialist out of the santa clara office definitely a challenge but exciting
6819483 i make things happen i can get a diverse career and the ability to make a difference as a company we recognize change and lead it thats great
6819484 the opportunity it is important to earn the right to ask by working hard and
6819485 the company is changing the world i feel a part of that
6819486 emcs well deserved and global reputation as a top tier technology company has been years in the making
6819487 digital happenings such as surveillance photos web search histories and financial transaction journals http www emc com leadership digital universe expanding digital universe htm
6819488 i had reached a point in my career where i needed a new opportunity a place where i could be more creative and face some new professional challenges
6819489 at the time the emc virtual career fair was advertised i was interviewing with genzyme and google
6819490 she told me how to teleport to the emc facility where i met polly pearson and a number of other people from emc then i followed the recruiter to the interview area where we talked for a half hour it was a fun and exciting experience not what youd usually expect at a job interview
6819491 when i have an idea people are always ready to listen
6819492 and if it turns out to be a good idea theres a lot of support for implementing it thats just what i wanted
6819493 enjoying innovative ways of harnessing technology and social networks for talent acquisition
6819494 this is our third time around and of course we are desperate
6819495 if penny did get any elbows im sure shed give one back and im sure all of us would give one back too
6819496 that is their style that is the way they play
6819497 i dont think we back down from that in any way shape or form and we will be there again tomorrow all of us being physical
6819498 and thats to be expected youre playing for a gold medal this is the biggest prize in the world
6819499 how are the dead raised and with what kind of body do they come
6819500 o death where is your victory o death where is your sting

6819502 op deze manier kunnen deze onderdrukte groep moslimas gemakkelijker deelnemen aan het maatschappelijke leven
6819503 who would want to make history anyway male or female
6819504 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6819505 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6819506 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6819507 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6819508 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6819509 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6819510 one of the options we would have is to protest the rfp
6819511 last year is probably the best the leagues ever been i think the pac 10 is going to be very competitive this year with a lot of parity
6819512 those two big guys for sure have to contribute because were short handed in terms of numbers of bodies inside
6819513 will we have seven of the top 21 picks in this years draft probably not but were going to have a lot of really good players again
6819514 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6819515 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6819516 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6819517 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6819518 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6819519 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails

6819523 and i think a big chunk of that was her international exposure and her cultural understanding shes been in 32 countries in her life now and shes lived in five and its not bad for an 18 year old i think
6819524 i made a mistake in telling them you dont do that they were really pumped up
6819525 ive been extremely lucky because each time we move the family is positive about it weve had no problems well weve had the typical problems
6819526 but nothing that would force us to go home so its been a super ride
6819527 if this company isnt growing its very hard for the rest of the company to hit its growth targets because everyone has to grow by a factor of 10
6819528 but the repositories have nowhere near the amount of software that ubuntu has
6819529 heres what i think is the biggest advantage pclinuxos has over ubuntu i can download hundreds of mbs in updates over 6 months and ill have the latest version of pclinuxos i download the same hundreds of mbs to keep ubuntu updated and in 6 months i still need a huge upgrade to have the latest version of ubuntu
6819530 ubuntu repo is filled with things that most people will never need or use
6819531 its not really pclinuxos vs ubuntu as it is more about kde vs gnome
6819532 as far as i know you could not upgrade your pclos from 93 to 2007 using just package updates pclos 2007 is a complete rework from ground up comparing to 93 and there is no predictability regarding how it would be the next time around
6819533 and how do you know what most or all people need or use
6819534 if youre referring to bleeding edge kernel version 2 6 18 is not exactly it either
6819535 then i guess kubuntu is a myth and suse does not offer kde either
6819536 as far as pclos vs world well when you try to proclaim pclos to be the best youre just asking for it pclos seems to be the new fanboi darling but not much more

6819586 la zona non stata ancora studiata un discorso completamente aperto e poi credo che sia giusto fare un confronto pure con i tifosi perch non deve trattarsi di una sede scomoda sarebbe controproducente
6819587 diciamo che ancora non c un progetto sicuro una localizzazione precisa semmai un lavoro avviato che dovremo portare a termine il prima possibile la struttura sar interamente pagata dallas roma ma il comune cercher di fornire le aree il nostro ruolo sar quello di assecondare il progetto con la disponibilit delle aree e con i permessi necessari per rendere il tutto economicamente sostenibile
6819588 sar uno stadio allinglese quindi con gli spalti adiacenti al campo dentro sorgerebbero dei ristoranti un albergo e tutte le comodit utili a rendere la struttura un luogo di socializzazione
6819589 no per il museo stavamo studiando la possibilit di costruirlo a testaccio o comunque allinterno del grande raccordo anulare

6819636 school spending has been rising much faster than inflation for over fifty years historically weve done a great job getting state legislatures to direct enormous geysers of money into the government school system and in the past when people asked why our results were so lousy we just told them we needed more money but now that spending is over 10 000 per student theyre not swallowing that as much as they used to options
6819637 we definitely need to do more to shift the blame for educational failure to something thats outside of schools control
6819638 agreed but how can we do that in a way that continues to increase our budgets
6819639 well weve always said we cant be expected to teach kids if theyre poor or sick or have anything at all wrong with them right so lets tell them all social services should be brought into schools

6819671 delete zeroes from the iraqi dinar is not a purely operational process greatly affects the iraqi economy a phenomenon that simulates the illusion cash and do not constitute a real phenomenon
6819672 the real value of the monetary unit in general and in particular the dinar is the quantity of goods and services that can be obtained at the time did not reflect the monetary value reflected the number before any signs of the true value of the monetary unit
6819673 from that standpoint the process of lifting the zeroes kept or not a thing or pursuant to the extent economically influential psychological impact on the language of economic circulation of the currency
6819674 the process of improving the value of a currency is not abstract but are measures economic performance which improves the economic base of the country and reflected its impact on external balances it the trade balance current account balance of payments
6819675 based on many international experience it should improve economic performance through the establishment of a comprehensive renaissance in the sectors of the iraqi national income to develop a positive performance in the real value of income and no monetary value
6819676 as it should be noted that it is necessary to diversify sources of income and not to submit to the adoption of a single source of oil and a major financier of the economy to become iraqs economy and the policy of wind blown oil market and captiousness dollar and oil and then the final onus is on the iraqi dinar
6819677 in khmsenja last century agriculture was the intervention in financing and supplementing the iraqi economy and oil revenues were doing this in addition to a modest contribution to the industry but now the situation with great regret deteriorating economy and reclining entirely on the economics of oil you can see what happens from floundering and chaos economic
6819678 the process of deleting zeroes from the iraqi dinar did not change much of a difference with the exception of reducing the large quantities of banknotes in circulation in the market which is supposed to carry rights in the process of exchange
6819679 the problem does not lie in the zeroes but lies in the relationship between fiscal and monetary policy to economic policy of iraq and the disruption of the iraqi economy and the fragility of the economic security and political concern felt by people on the iraqi dinar especially after long suffering undergone by iraq and the deterioration of the currency iraqi and very high rates of inflation

6819707 we are extremely happy to be working with the columbus blue jackets and syracuse crunch because as an organization they believe in developing their prospects the right way and thats what we strive for here
6819708 one thing also makes it an attractive partnership is the two echl teams that columbus and syracuse worked with last had great success elmira finished second in the division last year and was one game away from the division finals and the year before that dayton made it to the kelly cup finals our fans should be thrilled to bet getting these guys into chiefs jerseys because they are proven winners

6819729 liam deserves an awful amount of credit as do the physios
6819730 into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiffs rights
6819731 the state has put forward no substantive justifications for the restrictions imposed by election law 7 122 instead the state relies exclusively on its contrived argument that tabulating absentee ballots could cause a delay in finalizing election results which could interfere with the acrcs ability to nominate a candidate in situations where quick action was required
6819732 the state has burdened the plaintiffs rights for a reason that is exceptionally and extraordinarily weak while the burden on the plaintiffs rights is not large and while our review is accordingly deferential we nonetheless conclude that the states proffered reasons have such infinitesimal weight that they do not justify the burdens imposed

6819759 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show that he is completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6819760 unfortunately we couldnt accept any more kids its not something we like to do
6819761 one of the reasons that i think the programs are more popular is because of the changes we made

6819773 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6819774 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6819782 our preparation made the difference youre never ready for something like this but when it was time to get packed they were packed in like seven minutes

6819791 subprime mortgage issues remain a key factor in influencing mortgage fraud directly and indirectly the subprime share of outstanding loans has more than a doubled since 2003 putting a greater share of loans at higher risk of failure additionally during 2007 there were more than 2 2 million foreclosure filings reported on approximately 1 29 million properties nationally up 75 percent from 2006 the declining housing market affects many in the mortgage industry who are paid by commission during declining markets mortgage fraud perpetrators may take advantage of industry personnel attempting to generate loans to maintain current standards of living
6819792 that we are having a major speculative splurge as this is written is obvious to anyone not captured by vacuous optimism there is now far more money flowing into the stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it there are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute historically aware men and women to manage them i am not given to prediction ones foresight is forgotten only ones errors are well remembered but there is here a basic recurrent process it comes with rising prices whether of stocks real estate works of art or anything else this increase attracts attention and buyers which produces the further effect of even higher prices expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up the process continues optimism with its market effect is the order of the day prices go up even more then for reasons that will endlessly be debated come the end the descent is always more sudden than the increase a balloon that has been punctured does not deflate in an orderly way to repeat i make no prediction i only observe that this phenomenon has manifested itself many times since 1637 when dutch speculators saw tulip bulbs as their magic road to wealth and 1720 when john law brought presumptive wealth and then sudden poverty to paris through the pursuit of gold to this day undiscovered in louisiana in these years aslso the great south sea bubble spread financial devastation in britain
6819793 through 1925 the pursuit of effortless riches brought people to florida in satisfactorily increasing numbers
6819794 not more than three fourths of a mile from the prosperous and fast growing city of nettie
6819795 this reluctance to concede that the end has come is also in accordance with the classic pattern the end had come in florida in 1925 bank clearings in miami were 1 066 528 000 by 1928 they were down to 143 364 000 farmers who had sold their land at a handsome price and had condemned themselves as it later sold for double treble quadruple the original price now on occasion got it back through a whole chain of subsequent defaults sometimes it was equipped with eloquently named streets and with sidewalks street lamps and taxes and assessments amounting to several times its current value
6819796 he was a director to general motors an ally of the du ponts and soon to be chairman of the democratic national committee by choice of al smith
6819797 the shrewd worldly wise candidate of one of the great political parties chooses one of the outstanding operators in the stock market as a goodwill creator and popular vote getter
6819798 if smith should be elected with a democratic congress we are almost certain to have a resulting business depression in 1929
6819799 the election of hoover and a republican congress should result in continued prosperity for 1929
6819800 there is no cause for worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
6819801 some of those in positions of authority wanted the boom to continue they were making money out of it and they had an intimation of the personal disaster which awaited them when the boom came to an end but there were also some who saw however dimly that a wild speculation was in progress and that something should be done for these people however every proposal to act raised the same intractable problem the consequences of successful action seemed almost as terrible as the consequences of inaction and they could be more horrible for those who took action a bubble can easily be punctured but to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy among those who sensed what was happening in 1929 there was some hope but no confidence that the boom could be made to subside

6819825 weve been on and off the site all week long
6819826 these allegations were all regarding changing a withdrawn failing grade to a withdrawn grade as a courtesy to students
6819827 and there are three issues with it that interferes in the independence of the academic side of the institution its a violation of the student handbook and its inequitable that some students have that access
6819828 relieve themselves of their angst or complaints theyve been hearing
6819829 ive been told that if the president is aware of someone he feels would be able to teach one or more courses he has sought to offer those individuals positions without submission of applications
6819830 ive actually had people come to my office privately with concerns about scholarship assignments and preferential housing beyond what has been in the papers
6819831 ive heard words like reprehensible and detesting and there have just been very strong emotions
6819832 id like to say many of the faculty in my college have contacted me and theres just a great deal of disgust over the issue with the president
6819833 for the record id like to note that this is unacceptable
6819834 i think this is an important issue that frankly is distracting this entire university
6819835 so im going to request that whatever the subcommittee decides all recommendations or resolutions if any come before the senate at our next meeting on sept 9
6819836 much of the action suggests there might be corruption in the system
6819837 theyve also suggested a change in the way the state of arkansas manages the university even tweaking how the board of trustees is selected
6819838 we wanted to get their viewpoints their words on this
6819839 and we ran these statements by each and every one of these vice presidents and they did have edits and we made changes so this i think is a reference of their accurate statements

6819845 all questions about the vp selection should be directed to the obama campaign
6819846 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6819847 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it

6819859 we dont feel that we are firing on full pelt at the moment which isnt bad if we are picking up points
6819860 we feel weve still got a lot more to come
6819861 hopefully we can slowly start to turn the screw and get at a level that we are capable of playing
6819862 they turned us over her last year and we turned them over here at their place so we know its going to be difficult

6819870 we caught 21 people for drink driving between wednesday and sunday during the rodeo week
6819871 we caught about 60 for the whole of june and july so in just five days we got about one third of the number we caught in the previous two months
6819872 there is a mindset that were a country area so the rules dont apply here it might be rural queensland not the south east but the same rules apply and will be enforced
6819873 its quite simple we want to stop you from killing yourself
6819874 we are trying to figure out how to stop people getting behind the wheel drunk were at a loss as to how to re educate people
6819875 i support the medias reporting of decisions made in our courts on a daily basis and if the threat of public scrutiny acts as a deterrent to drink drivers then that would be a good thing
6819876 drink drivers certainly place themselves and other road users in grave danger and that is why this government has introduced tough measures to deal with such offenders
6819877 its a check to make sure everythings still working and hes still desirable
6819878 so its a talk about why thats common in long term relationships
6819879 the two main reasons that occurs relate to expectations about desire and how that manifests early in the relationship and expectations about how that will continue
6819880 differences between men and women about what sexual desire is and what it actually means to them
6819881 women who are not at the beginning of a relationship often dont have high levels of sexual desire
6819882 but thats not a very good fit for whats portrayed in the media or in the early stages of a relationship
6819883 the most important thing its maybe not that exciting is psychological intimacy
6819884 having in the background of the relationship physical affectation emotional communication verbal communication and behaviour that evidences care trust and respect
6819885 as soon as you add a sexual agenda in people interpret that as disingenuous psychological intimacy is the fastest route to fixing things
6819886 there is significant decay in the mortar between bricks and they believe a lot of the brick units have been affected by years of weather
6819887 bricks are missing from along the shafts and there are places where you can see right through the centre of the chimney
6819888 the report said the concrete base was also significantly decayed to the point of uncertainty about its ability to withstand cyclones or strong winds and that it could be expected to pose a risk to users of the pathway and residents in the area
6819889 we had architectural designs and landscape designs for the 200 units and they incorporated the chimney and a walking path around it
6819890 once we were received a current structure report we realised it was going to be a risk and safety hazard we had to go back to the drawing board and made significant progress to design the area without a chimney in place
6819891 council is willing to look at any information about safety concerns but we will be urging the developers to investigate every option to keep the history alive at this site
6819892 it is a great monument to the hardworking people of a bygone era and it would be sad to see it go
6819893 when we agreed with the developer to preserve the chimney council spent a fortune putting a lightning rod on it and personally i havent seen a report on why it should be pulled down
6819894 that area was supposed to be commercial to provide a small restaurant precinct and pub if it is changed to housing i am afraid the chimney and its historical value will play second fiddle to residential money
6819895 whether you are vegetarian or carnivore it is one of those things that people of townsville just know is always there
6819896 we felt it would have given us a decent reference point and landmark unfortunately the design of the project could not be put over and above the safety of users of the path and the safety of the project itself so we had to come up with an alternative design
6819897 a paved replica in two dimensional form of the chimney will be integrated into the pathway
6819898 there will also be some historical interpretive signage similar to the styles seen in other historical areas and parks with details from local historians about the meatworks and what part it played in the development of the city
6819899 i tell you the truth as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me

6819904 scandalism is all the rage these days in london where the hottest gossip of the day is found in neither fleet street rags nor blogs but rather spray painted on the very walls of its subjects homes exhibit a sienna miller whose recent only slightly immodest dalliance with married father balthazar getty among other tormented ex flames may or may not have prompted the scandalism above which materialized on millers home late one recent evening
6819905 we agree those topless pics with still married balthazar getty werent in the best of taste but is this really necessary and shouldnt getty be getting as much crap as her

6819932 like most second year law students on the harvard law review senator obama wrote an unsigned student case comment that summarized a recent decision by a state or lower federal court the piece analyzed a case in which a mother was sued by her child for injuries caused by the mothers negligent driving during her pregnancy senator obama concluded that in such cases the illinois supreme court was correct not to allow lawsuits by children against their mothers
6819933 he wrote that the best way to protect the health of fetuses was to provide prenatal education and health care to pregnant women issues he remains committed to today and which he has worked to advance as a legislator and in this campaign
6819934 student obama was acutely attuned to the limits of the judiciary and of suits between children and their mother in this sensitive area
6819935 this is a modest and balanced piece that fits easily within the framework of the law at the time
6819936 involving maternal activities that might be considered intentional or reckless infliction of prenatal injuries on the fetus
6819937 imposing civil liability on mothers may be as likely to deter the carrying of pregnancies to term as to deter maternal negligence during pregnancy
6819938 fetal maternal tort suits might entail far more intrusive scrutiny of a womans behavior than the scrutiny involved in the discrete regulation of the abortion decision
6819939 on the other hand the state may also have a more compelling interest in ensuring that fetuses carried to term do not suffer from debilitating injuries than it does in ensuring that any particular fetus is born

6819948 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6819949 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals
