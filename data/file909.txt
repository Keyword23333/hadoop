9090006 there have been several agents of the fbi who have said that it doesnt matter if peltier is guilty or not he will never be freed the fbi will make sure of that and to me that sounds like a threat it was the fbi who threatened the life of anna mae aquash if she didnt cooperate in their investigations of who killed the agents standing deer was also threatened with the loss of his life if he revealed the assassination plot in 1978 when standing deer was released and became involved with working for peltiers freedom he was murdered in his houston home in 2003 in aquashs case it seems strange that all of a sudden the justice department and fbi are being cast as heros in solving the case but from so many of the sources it is highly questionable that looking cloud got a fair trial and that graham will probably be expected to see anything better so if graham is convicted then will the case be over for indians will justice be served on a plate of bs greedily devoured by anti aim rhetorics and the media

9090017 the hex was divided into 2 5cm squares with overlaps beyond the boundary i took the nearest primary features on the overall map such as hill hexes wood hexes town hexes etc and for each small 2 5 cm square consulted the table below so for example if there is a wood hex three hexes distant then theres a 70 chance they will occur in any of your 2 5 cm squares this is designated as a hill hex itself there will definitely be at least some elevation in each little square then its just a matter of artistic license and a few additions such as marshes ponds streams tracks and so on to make your hex feel just right

9090026 merupakan tanda baiknya islam seseorang dia meninggalkan sesuatu yang tidak berguna baginya
9090027 hendaklah kalian berpegang teguh terhadap sunnahku dan sunnahnya khulafaurrasyidin yang mendapatkan petunjuk gigitlah genggamlah dengan kuat dengan geraham
9090028 katakanlah siapakah yang memberi rezeki kepadamu dari langit dan bumi atau siapakah yang kuasa menciptakan pendengaran dan penglihatan dan siapakah yang mengeluarkan yang hidup dari yang mati dan mengeluarkan yang mati dari yang hidup dan siapakah yang mengatur segala urusan
9090029 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka menyembah ku aku tidak menghendaki rezeki sedikit pun dari mereka dan aku tidak menghendaki supaya mereka memberi aku makan sesungguhnya allah dialah maha pemberi rezeki yang mempunyai kekuatan lagi sangat kokoh
9090030 dan demikianlah kami jadikan bagi tiap tiap nabi itu musuh yaitu syaithan syaithan dari jenis manusia dan dari jenis jin sebahagian mereka membisikkan kepada sebahagian yang lain perkataan pekataan yang indah indah untuk menipu manusia
9090031 maka hadapkanlah wajahmu dengan lurus kepada agama allah tetaplah di atas fitroh allah yang telah menciptakan manusia menurut fitroh itu tidak ada perubahan pada fitroh allah
9090032 setiap anak yang lahir dilahirkan atas fitroh maka kedua orang tuanya yang menjadikannya yahudi nashroni atau majusi
9090033 dahulu manusia itu adalah ummat yang satu maka allah mengutus para nabi sebagai pemberi kabar gembira dan pemberi peringatan
9090034 sesungguhnya kami telah memberikan wahyu kepadamu sebagaimana kami telah memberikan wahyu kepada nuh dan nabi nabi yang kemudiannya
9090035 dahulu manusia itu adalah ummat yang satu lalu mereka berselisih maka allah mengutus para nabi sebagai pemberi kabar gembira dan pemberi peringatan
9090036 di awal umat ini jumlah orang yang bertauhid cukup banyak sedangkan di masa belakangan jumlah mereka sedikit
9090037 seandainya mereka mempersekutukan allah niscaya lenyaplah dari mereka amalan yang telah mereka kerjakan
9090038 jika kamu mempersekutukan allah niscaya akan hapuslah amalmu dan tentulah kamu termasuk orang orang yang merugi
9090039 kami tidak meminta rezeki kepadamu kamilah yang memberi rezeki kepadamu dan kesudahan yang baik itu adalah bagi orang yang bertakwa
9090040 sesungguhnya orang yang mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka pasti allah mengharamkan kepadanya surga dan tempat kembalinya ialah neraka tidaklah ada bagi orang orang dzolim itu seorang penolong pun
9090041 orang orang yang beriman dan tidak mencampuri keimanan mereka dengan kedzoliman bagi mereka keamanan dan mereka mendapatkan petunjuk
9090042 dan sungguh kami telah mengutus rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan
9090043 dan kami tidak mengutus seorang rasul pun sebelum kamu melainkan kami wahyukan kepadanya bahwasannya tiada ilah yang berhak disembah melainkan aku maka beribadahlah kamu sekalian kepadaku
9090044 orang orang yang beriman dan tidak mencampur adukkan keimanan mereka dengan kedzoliman mereka itulah orang orang yang mendapatkan keamanan dan mereka itu adalah orang orang yang mendapatkan petunjuk
9090045 tatkala ayat ini turun mereka bertanya siapa diantara kami yang tidak mendzolimi dirinya maka rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menjawab ayat ini bukan seperti yang kalian fahami tidakkah kalian mendengar ucapan luqman sesungguhnya syirik adalah kedzoliman yang besar
9090046 kemudian kitab itu kami wariskan kepada orang orang yang kami pilih diantara hamba hamba kami lalu di antara mereka ada yang mendzolimi dirinya sendiri dan di antara mereka ada yang pertengahan dan di antara mereka ada yang bersegera berbuat kebaikan dengan seizin allah yang demikian itu adalah karunia yang amat besar
9090047 mengapa allah akan mengadzab kalian jika kalian bersyukur dan beriman
9090048 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan mengerjakan amal shalih bahwa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa di bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang yang sebelum mereka berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka agama yang telah di ridhoi nya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan menukar keadaan mereka sesudah mereka berada dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentosa mereka tetap menyembah ku dengan tiada mempersekutukan aku dengan sesuatu apa pun dan barangsiapa yang tetap kafir sesudah janji itu maka itulah orang orang yang fasik
9090049 sesungguhnya allah tidaklah mengampuni dosa syirik terhadap nya dan akan mengampuni yang lebih ringan dari itu bagi orang yang dia kehendaki
9090050 wahai muadz tahukah engkau hak allah atas hamba nya dan hak hamba nya atas allah
9090051 hak allah atas hamba nya adalah beribadah kepada nya tanpa menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun dan hak hamba nya atas allah adalah tidak menyiksa barangsiapa yang tidak menyekutukannya dengan sesuatu apapun
9090052 barangsiapa yang bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang berhak diibadahi kecuali allah semata tidak ada sekutu bagi nya dan muhammad adalah hamba dan rasul nya dan isa adalah hambanya rasul nya kalimat yang dianugrahkan nya kepada maryam dan ruh dari sisinya dan bersaksi bahwa perihal surga dan neraka itu adalah benar allah memasukkannya kedalam surga walau bagaimana amalnya
9090053 makna sabda rasulullah walau bagaimana amalnya yaitu amalnya yang baik maupun yang buruk karena ahli tauhid mesti masuk surga mungkin pula maknanya penduduk surga memasukinya sesuai dengan amalan masing masing dari mereka dalam menempati tingkatan tingkatannya
9090054 yang tertera dalam hadist ubadah khusus bagi seorang yang mengucapkan hal hal yang disampaikan oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam lalu menggandengkan dua kalimat syahadat dengan hakikat keimanan dan tauhid yang terlampir dalam haditsnya sehingga dia memperoleh pahala yang bisa memperingan timbangan dosa dosanya serta mengundang keampunan rahmat dan masuk surga pada tahapan yang pertama
9090055 masuk surga terbagi menjadi dua jenis pertama masuk yang sempurna
9090056 sesungguhnya allah tidak mengampuni perbuatan syirik kepada nya dan mengampuni yang lebih ringan dari itu bagi orang yang dikehendaki nya
9090057 sesungguhnya allah mengharomkan api neraka bagi orang yang mengucapkan la ilaha illallah tidak ada sesembahan yang berhak diibadahi selain allah dengan hal itu dia mencari wajah allah
9090058 syaikhul islam ibnu taimiyah berkata sesungguhnya seorang yang mencari wajah allah harus menyempurnakan sarana sarana yang mendukung pencariannya
9090059 bahwasanya nuh alaihis salam pernah berkata kepada anaknya saat akan wafat aku perintahkan engkau berpegang dengan laa ilaaha illallah karena langit yang tujuh dan bumi yang tujuh jika diletakan pada satu anak timbangan dan la ilaaha illallah pada satu anak timbangan yang lain niscaya la ilaha illallah lebih berat daripada yang lainnya dan jika langit yang tujuh beserta bumi yang tujuh membentuk lingkaran yang tak diketahui tempat sambungannya niscaya laa ilaaha illallah akan memutuskannya
9090060 allah taala berfirman wahai anak adam jika seandainya engkau mendatangiku dengan sepenuh bumi kesalahan sedangakan engkau tidak berbuat syirik sedikit pun niscaya aku akan mendatangaimu dengan sepenuh bumi keampunan
9090061 pada hari kiamat nanti seorang dari umatku dipanggil di hadapan para makhluk lalu dibentangkan sembilan puluh sembilan gulungan miliknya setiap gulungan sejauh mata memandang lalu dikatakan adakah sesuatu yang engkau ingkari dari gulungan gulungan ini apakah para pencatatku yang menjaga amalmu telah mendzolimimu lalu dikatakan apakah engkau memiliki sebuah udzur atau kebaikan lalu dikatakan benar sesungguhnya engkau memiliki sebuah kebaikan dan engkau tidak akan didzolimi pada hari ini kemudian dikeluarkan satu kartu miliknya yang bertuliskan asyhadu an la ilaaha illallah wa anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh aku bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang berhak diibadahi kecuali allah dan aku bersaksi bahwa muhammad adalah hamba dan utusannya maka dia berkata wahai rabbku apa nilai kartu ini dibanding gulungan gulungan itu lalu dikatakan sesungguhnya engkau tidak akan didzolimi kemudian diletakkan gulungan gulungan itu pada satu anak timbangan dan kartu ini pada anak timbangan yang lain ternyata timbangan gulungan gulungan itu ringan dan timbangan kartu ini berat
9090062 amal amal perbuatan tidaklah berbeda beda keutamaannya dikarenakan bentuk dan bilangannya hanya saja keutamaannya berbeda beda sebab perbedaan keyakinan dalam hati sehingga dua amalan bisa memiliki bentuk yang satu namun nilai perbedaan di antara keduanya sejauh antara langit dan bumi
9090063 perhatikan hadits tentang sebuah kartu yang diletakkan pada satu anak timbangan lalu diimbangi dengan timbangan sembilan puluh sembilan gulungan yang masing masingnya sejauh mata memandang ternyata timbangan kartu itu berat dan timbangan gulungan gulungan itu ringan maka pemiliknya tidak diadzab merupakan perkara yang dimaklumi bahwa setiap orang yang bertauhid memiliki kartu ini akan tetapi kebanyakan mereka masuk mereka dengan sebab dosa dosanya
9090064 dalam mengucapkan dua kalimat syahadat harus memilki ilmu dan keyakinan tentang maknanya
9090065 berilmulah engkau bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang berhak diibadahi melainkan allah
9090066 kecuali orang yang bersaksi dengan kebenaran sedangkan mereka mengetahui berilmu tentang yang dipersaksikan az zukhruf 86 mengucapkan dua kalimat syahadat tanpa mengerti maknanya atau tidak meyakininya maka hal itu tidak bermanfaat begitu pula jika tidak mengamalkan kandungannya yaitu sikap berlepas diri dari syirik dan memurnikan ucapan serta amalan untuk allah maka tidak bermanfaat baik ucapan hati maupun lisan demikian pula amalan hati serta anggota badan hal yang dikemukakan di atas adalah kesepakatan para ulama
9090067 termasuk dari keutamaan tauhid adalah merupakan sebab yang paling besar untuk melonggarkan kesusahan kesusahan serta bisa menjadi penangkal dari berbagai akibat buruk dalam kehidupan dunia dan akhirat mencegah kekekalan dalam api neraka meskipun dalam hatinya hanya tertanam sebesar biji sawi keimanan juga mencegah masuk neraka secara mutlak bila dia menyempurnakannya dalam hati ini termasuk keutamaan tauhid yang paling mulia memberi petunjuk dan rasa aman yang sempurna di dunia dan akhirat kepada pemiliknya merupakan sebab satu satunya untuk menggapai ridho allah dan pahala nya orang yang paling bahagia yang memperoleh syafaat muhammad shallallahu alaihi wasallam adalah yang mengucapkan la ilaha illallah dengan ikhlas dari hatinya penerimaan seluruh amalan dan ucapan baik yang tampak dan yang tersembunyi tergantung kepada tauhid seseorang demikian pula penyempurnaannya dan pemberian ganjarannya perkara perkara ini menjadi sempurna dan lengkap tatkala tauhid dan keikhlasan kepada allah menguat ini termasuk keutamaan tauhid yang paling besar memudahkan seorang hamba untuk melakukan kebaikan kebaikan dan meninggalkan kemungkaran kemungkaran serta menghiburnya tatkala menghadapi berbagai musibah seorang yang ikhlas kepada allah dalam beriman dan bertauhid merasa ringan untuk melakukan ketaatan ketaatan karena dia mengharapkan pahala dan keridhoan rabbnya baginya terasa ringan meninggalkan hawa nafsu yang berupa maksiat karena dia takut terhadap kemurkaan dan siksa rabbnya bila tauhid sempurna dalam hati seseorang allah menjadikan pemiliknya mencintai keimanan serta menghiasinya dalam hatinya selanjutnya allah menjadikan pemiliknya membenci kekafiran kefasikan dan kemaksiatan lalu allah memasukkannya ke dalam golongan orang orang yang terbimbing meringankan segala kesulitan dan rasa sakit bagi seorang hamba semuanya itu sesuai dengan penyempurnaan tauhid dan iman yang dilakukan oleh seorang hamba sesuai pula dengan sikap seorang hamba saat menerima segala kesulitan dan rasa sakit dengan hati yang lapang jiwa yang tenang pasrah dan ridho terhadap ketentuan ketentuan allah yang menyakitkan melepaskan seorang hamba dari perbudakan ketergantungan rasa takut pengharapan dan beramal untuk makhluq inilah keagungan dan kemulian yang hakiki bersamaan dengan itu dia hanya beribadah dan menghambakan diri kepada allah tidak mengharap takut dan kembali kecuali hanya kepada allah dengan demikian sempurna keberuntungannya dan terbukti keberhasilannya ini termasuk keutamaan tauhid yang paling besar bila tauhid sempurna dalam hati seseorang dan terealisasi lengkap dengan keikhlasan yang sempurna amalnya yang sedikit berubah menjadi banyak segenap amal dan ucapannya berlipat ganda tanpa batas dan hitungan kalimat ikhlas lailaha illallah menjadi berat dalam timbangan amal hambanya ini sehingga tak terimbangi oleh langit langit dan bumi beserta seluruh makhluq penghuninya perkara ini sebagaimana tertera dalam hadits abi said dan hadits tentang sebuah kartu yang bertuliskan la ilaha ilallah tapi mampu mengalahkan berat timbangan sembilan puluh sembilan gulungan catatan dosa dan setiap gulungan sejauh mata memandang yang demikian karena keikhlasan orang yang mengucapkannya berapa banyak orang yang mengucapkannya tetapi tidak mencapai prestasi ini sebab di dalam hatinya tidak terdapat tauhid dan keikhlasan yang sempurna seperti atau mendekati yang terdapat dalam hati hamba nya ini ini termasuk keutamaan tauhid yang tak bisa tertandingi oleh sesuatu apapun allah menjamin kemenangan dan pertolongan di dunia keagungan kemuliaan petunjuk kemudahan perbaikan kondisi dan situasi serta pelurusan ucapan dan perbuatan bagi pemilik tauhid allah menghindarkan orang orang yang bertauhid dan beriman dari keburukan keburukan dunia dan akherat allah menganugerahkan atas mereka kehidupan yang baik ketenangan kepada nya dan kenyamanan dengan mengingat nya cukup banyak dalil yang menguatkan keterangan keterangan ini baik dari al quran maupun as sunnah wallahu alam
9090068 mereka meninggalkan perkara yang tidak mengandung dosa karena khawatir terdapat dosa di dalamnya
9090069 sesungguhnya ibrahim adalah seorang imam yang dapat dijadikan teladan lagi patuh kepada allah dan hanif dan sekali kali bukanlah dia termasuk orang orang yang berbuat syirik
9090070 sesungguhnya orang orang yang berhati hati karena takut akan adzab rabb mereka dan orang orang yang beriman dengan ayat ayat rabb mereka dan orang orang yang tidak mempersekutukan dengan rabb mereka sesuatu apapun dan orang orang yang memberikan apa yang telah mereka berikan dengan hati yang takut karena mereka tahu bahwa sesungguhnya mereka akan kembali kepada rabb mereka mereka itu bersegera untuk mendapat kebaikan kebaikan dan merekalah orang orang yang segera memperolehnya
9090071 57 61 ayat ayat di atas menyebutkan kriteria orang orang yang beriman dan bertauhid dengan baik
9090072 mereka berbuat baik dan beramal shalih karena takut terhadap rabb mereka dan khawatir ditimpa oleh sesuatu yang mereka tidak inginkan inilah kondisi seorang mukmin berbuat kebaikan karena takut kepada allah dan khawatir tidak memperoleh apa yang mereka inginkan
9090073 seorang mumin mengumpulkan antara perbuatan baik dan rasa takut kepada allah sedangkan seorang munafik mengumpulkan antara perbuatan jelek dan rasa aman dari siksa allah
9090074 dan orang orang yang beriman dengan ayat ayat rabb mereka
9090075 dan orang orang yang tidak mempersekutukan dengan rabb mereka sesuatu apapun
9090076 apakah engkau tidak melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai ilah sesembahan nya
9090077 hendaklah kalian berpegang teguh terhadap sunnahku dan sunnahnya khulafaurrasyidin yang mendapatkan petunjuk gigitlah genggamlah dengan kuat dengan geraham
9090078 merupakan tanda baiknya islam seseorang dia meninggalkan sesuatu yang tidak berguna baginya
9090079 hendaklah kalian berpegang teguh terhadap sunnahku dan sunnahnya khulafaurrasyidin yang mendapatkan petunjuk gigitlah genggamlah dengan kuat dengan geraham

9090085 there is a tremendous movement with divestment at least 13 states are introducing it this year
9090086 but i will say that legislation that is not voted on or defeated says as much about a legislature as the bills that pass
9090087 the board has conveyed its concern that legislative restrictions related to sudan no matter how well meaning could lead to other restrictions motivated by social and political interests that are not necessarily in the best interests of the state and local employees
9090088 at some point restrictions on the vrs investments program could depress returns and shift additional costs to the state and local taxpayers
9090089 i would not introduce legislation if the threshold was not genocide
9090090 these companies were investing in are going to be risky
9090091 the vote last year and the support we got this year indicated strong support for the sudan bills and i was very grateful for that
9090092 knoweldge power power energy energy matter matter gravity a really good bookstore is just a genteel black hole that knows how to read
9090093 one thing we can do is remove our investments from our retirement system to make it less economically viable for companies to invest in sudan
9090094 on a philosophical level we should do something and it is the only thing we can do
9090095 the virginia retirement system under certain circumstances to divest itself of investments in companies meeting certain criteria gauged to be related to the genocide in the darfur region of sudan
9090096 the vote last year and the support we got this year indicated strong support for the sudan bills and i was very grateful for that
9090097 i need to go show them why it will help affect genocide but that is a tough thing to do
9090098 an estimated 300 000 to 400 000 people have been killed by the government of sudan and its janjaweed allies since the darfur crisis began in 2003 more than 2 000 000 people have been displaced from their homes and more than 250 000 people from darfur remain in refugee camps in chad
9090099 entities that provide significant practical support for genocide including certain non united states companies presently doing business in sudan
9090100 wishes to convey a number of concerns about divestment legislation
9090101 legislative restrictions proposed in this bill while affecting only a small slice of the vrs trust fund could open the door to further restrictions aimed at addressing other pressing political issues such as terrorism
9090102 well written shareholder proposals that call for offending companies to terminate business operations in sudan
9090103 pulling investments out of darfur is so far removed from the guy on the ground trying to scratch out a living
9090104 would make it a law to sever all funds for any company that does business with sudan
9090105 pulling investments out of sudan will only make things worse if you take away all that money youre talking about a real genocide
9090106 already caused nine companies to withdraw or substantially alter their policies in sudan the results are real and the more states and investors that join this campaign the more effective the pressures on these companies will be
9090107 the big disappointment with the legislation is that the house of delegates showed an unwillingness to join dozens of other states who are taking action to end the genocide in darfur
9090108 this is an action that can bring about serious change to the worlds worst humanitarian crisis at virtually no cost to the state

9090419 bonding is brought about by skin to skin contact of mother and infant after the infant comes out of the womb and this bonding process goes on and we know exactly what it is we know the three points of it audiovisual communication which means eye contact and the mothers voice nurturing breast feeding holding massaging fondling the infant in every way and play the play that spontaneously arises between the infant right from the beginning practically and the mother if those three things are enacted then you have healthy growth in the child and the interesting thing is that you have tremendous new growth in the mother she discovers an aspect of herself that she has never experienced before

9090633 then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake and then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert him whom they ought to trust and obey and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred and many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error and the love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity but he who endures to the end will be saved and this good news of the kingdom the gospel will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations and then will come the end

9090640 these people leave nothing but deceit and disgrace as an inheritance for future generations
9090641 essentially one of verbal magic the poet makes by naming it the process undoubtedly lies at the root of all poetry
9090642 the poems in this book individually and collectively are loaded with tons of emotions crafted in a rich array of stylistic devices and heavily charged with enough semantic venom to have the impact of a plastic bomb
9090643 autocratic leaders collaborators corruption murders character assassination liars post mortem intellectuals comatose professors dead lecturers who organise the ignorance of the faculty and pervert and muzzle discourse
9090644 bureaucratic obfuscators necromancers materialistic pursuits racketeers of power silence submission

9090647 and yet there was a time when people had faith implicit faith in this union without making any investigations but i ask you where is that faith now it has vanished so utterly the bonds have snapped we carry the scars of brotherhood in a country so unaccustomed to candour
9090648 after lunatic route we took from foumban as in a dantean inferno the anglophone cameroonian occupies the center of hell the surrounding concentric rings of this smouldering infernal canyon may embrace a multitude of other victims in the present cameroonian reality but there is no doubt that our people subjected to perpetual mental and psychological servitude are the story book victims of a cultural holocaust history has since the biblical cain and abel carved no grimmer monuments to its own propensity for unfathomable cynicism and evil
9090649 i can sell cameroon for less than asoumous whisky so i will not say i am a nationalist as such for i am definitely a patriot of southern cameroons not la republique
9090650 we southern cameroonians have always had leaders that are archetypal mediocres tribalistic deceitful and fraudulent since foumban our daily lives are therefore viewed by the neo colonial askari through a distorted quai dorsay prism where the sum total of a persons character merit and worth is defined by de gaulles language we have always been frog marched in the limbo of marginality alienated and directionless in the depths of ignominy
9090651 if it is true that there can be no meaningful discussion of african literature without reference to such cameroonian authors as mongo beti ferdinand oyono rene philombe calixte beyala and guillaume oyono mbia it is also true that such discussions never include authors writing in english
9090652 on the cameroonian muses crowded pantheon therefore we too have been firm of feet as your own fabien eboussi boulaga guillaume oyono mbia charly gabriel mbock gaston paul effa jacques fame ndongo hubert mono ndjana ferdinand leopold oyono the immortal mongo beti but ignorance as plato remarked is at the root of most misfortunes
9090653 what is clear is that the propensity for francophones to ignore anglophone cameroon history reflects the systemic marginalization of anglophone cameroon by the majority the fact that it goes almost unperceived by them only proves how endemic the problem is this exercise in the appropriation of history replete with complete discretion over its revision upon the authority of the narrator being of or from whence such history emanates is what passes for education of our people on our history even the events currently unfolding under our very eyes are distorted unscrupulously by those who think they have the moral authority to do so who think they have some right to determine what is truth
9090654 feudal oppression mountains of suspicions and hate retrogression post foumban pauperization and resentment
9090655 memory will remain an important talking drum to the present on how the historical journey of a people is perceived against the backdrop of an oppressive neo colonial culture
9090656 no one can speak for us only those who daily live through the humiliations the third class citizenship in the abattoir of servitude only we can fully comprehend and explore these contradictions in a society undergoing such rapid and confusing transition

9090822 nos sorprendi encontrar que antes de que una mosca vuele en respuesta a la amenaza de un depredador o un matamoscas sta planea la direcci n de su salto haciendo una serie de complejos movimientos

9090855 our company and healthvault are about innovation to improve peoples lives we are very pleased to be working with a forward thinking company like aperion to turn their pioneering community based health platform for inspiration residents into reality
9090856 the concept of bringing health care to the individual using both electronic and physical means is at the cutting edge of prevention and aggressive chronic disease management this approach is certainly part of the solution to our national health challenge
9090857 we are building the next great communities not only for the 21st century but the 22nd as well we are talking quantum leaps forward in the way real estate development is done we will use the best products and services available today to reduce the inefficiencies and lower the costs of daily life while allowing for flexibility in the future this has never been the approach or responsibility of developers in the past we accept the challenge for example preventative health care is fundamental for everyone and needs to start in the home we will enable this to happen now microsofts healthvault is one cornerstone of aperions overall community based health platform that broadens the opportunity for our residents schools and businesses to take advantage of a wide variety of consumer driven health choices that can lower the cost of their family medical expenses and health insurance premiums we plan to revolutionize both the health care delivery system and the home building industry at the same time
9090858 as policymakers and the public consider proposals for fundamental change there are lessons to be learned from looking abroad this survey shows that patients in the u s are frustrated by high costs and a complicated health care system
9090859 the lack of a link to care as well as insurance puts the uninsured at double jeopardy for both inefficient care and access barriers health systems designed to create medical homes could help improve patient safety coordination of care and reduce reliance on emergency rooms while also improving patient satisfaction
9090860 the potential gain has led to endorsement of the medical home concept among u s primary care physicians including the american academy of family physicians and the american academy of pediatrics
9090861 as countries confront the question of how best to organize care systems to achieve higher value the study highlights the importance and potential of having a relationship with a primary care source with characteristics of a medical home

9090869 we are trying to develop an industrial base out there for the whole northwest sector of albuquerque
9090870 we want to provide jobs and reverse the traffic flow so it is going west instead of crossing bridges into albuquerque
9090871 this new access road will help alleviate traffic congestion in one of the busiest parts of albuquerque
9090872 this is a great opportunity for us to move forward
9090873 this is something that has been 20 years in the making
9090874 what this will do is help us open up land for industrial development
9090875 it will bring in employers that pay higher wages and we have an improved picture in industry
9090876 it is a multi million dollar project and it will take years to complete

9090917 he suffered a fatal embolism that would eventually take his life
9090918 but he had the hardest time loving himself and that was the most difficult thing about being his friend for me watching him torture himself
9090919 good soul but he was a tortured soul but he loved his family and he loved his friends
9090920 and it was shining more than it had for a very long time
9090921 and her willingness to stand in front of him as he was reluctant to love himself and insisted on it caused him to eventually see the light
9090922 that we could all see it so much all of the time when he would put that horn in his mouth and make the most astonishingly honest music that could knock you over and it would sink right to the middle of you
9090923 he was standing right there and im not sure if i saw him fall asleep but i definitely saw him wake up
9090924 he also fell asleep next to me in his old blue volkswagen station wagon driving down 64 once
9090925 he could have done that for a living though it may not have been as lucrative
9090926 he told them with an honesty the same way he played
9090927 i would tell him jokes just so i could hear him tell them after me
9090928 leroi would engage me in animated conversation whenever i would encounter him at home or at church
9090929 more often than not he felt that the music in the episcopal church left a lot to be desired
9090930 i stood up to leave and he said hang on a sec
9090931 he was in his wheelchair and he took the better part of three or four minutes to get his wheels locked and he wouldnt let me leave until he stood up

9090937 people can wait a long time to get in to see their primary care doctor and longer for a specialist to have immediate access is huge
9090938 paying doctors to do more patient care over the internet is a small but important step in a good direction
9090939 it increases patient access and could significantly improve their satisfaction
9090940 its perfectly appropriate that we use 21st century technology in the 21st century
9090941 the concern i have is that online visits are simply not a substitute for an actual doctor
9090942 i couldnt have been happier to not sit in some hospital for half the night

9090952 this oct 14 is the first day of the major jewish festival of sukkot an important holy day on our communitys calendar
9090953 an election on that day would have a very adverse impact on the jewish electorate as well as scrutineers drivers other campaign and elections canada volunteers
9090954 i want to emphasize the importance of that date as a holy day especially in light of the fact that we did send a note to the prime ministers office about it
9090955 would be inappropriate insensitive and disenfranchise parts of the jewish community
9090956 but we have large scale advance polls which are available
9090957 you can also go to a returning office any day during a writ period to cast a ballot

9090963 they have knowledge of the successes of the civil rights era they feel hopeful but from a collective standpoint theyve seen the progress that has been made by black people sticking together for change
9090964 they didnt grow up with the sort of racism that their parents did that breeds individual self confidence but it also breeds a level of stress theyre not benchmarking themselves against how far black people have come from the past theyre benchmarking themselves against where everybody in society is today

9090998 let the people decide with their vote on the constitution
9090999 all of this work has been underway but of course it is necessary that it be accelerated and worked on permanently
9091000 the indigenous people know that the bolivarian government is the only one that has recognized their rights

9091134 a civilization without insanity without criminals and without war where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights are the aims of scientology

9091144 the question is what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9091145 hes chosen a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done
9091146 this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden
9091147 yes hi im here to meet with mr nayar is he in yet
9091148 hes been here since seven ill let him know that youve arrived
9091149 hi hows it going im sunil thanks for coming all the way down follow me
9091150 whats great about tv is its inevitability there will be an episode on monday and there will be an episode on the monday after that and its great because it teaches you to think creatively in way that is so much more efficient and inspired that you never thought that you could because
9091151 you cant get to the first day of preparation and say guys were really sorry we didnt come up with anything
9091152 theres no part of this process that i dont enjoy
9091153 i grew up lucky i mean the worst case scenario for me was always if i failed miserably and i ended up broke and i was penniless in new york i would have to move back in with the family i love
9091154 and if thats the worst case scenario nothing can ever be that horrible
9091155 as a person hes one of the best that ive ever met and in this industry one of the best writers ive ever met
9091156 every two years tom will hire somebody to be his assistant with the tacit knowledge that that person wants to be a writer its essentially grad school for writing somewhere after that two years he says let me see what you have and if he likes what you write he gives you a shot
9091157 heres a gentleman who has commitments i mean hes a businessman and hes got many interests hes got television shows in production he hires somebody he already knows doesnt want the job theyre doing but he hires them with the intention of grooming them to do the job they love only to hire yet another person who has to learn everything
9091158 i mean for him it would be so much easier to hire one person and stick them there and that would be the end of it but thats not his nature and thats the philanthropic attitude which i was groomed as a part of in this industry
9091159 the second i met ann donahue i thought this is sort of the counterpart to tom she said id love you to do this show shes warm smart humane and moral
9091160 without ann i couldnt have done it the people i work with are grounded
9091161 at the end of the day its just about going after those opportunities
9091162 there is a responsibility to tell the viewers something worth hearing and you dont want to deny it i mean we have the luxury to let david caruso have a conversation with someone in the last ten minutes of the show that actually has resonance
9091163 if dreaming is a luxury then being able to achieve your dreams and enjoy them is the greatest luxury of all the dream to come to los angeles and fail means youre lucky but the dream to come to la and succeed means youre the luckiest of the lucky and so the mandate of such a luxury is to give back you have to make the time its inexcusable not to

9091177 and you know i cant even recommend any reality show because the olympics is the only really style show that has any good in it there are so many terrible ones out now i dont know whats a really bad one thats on right now theres that one called hurl on g4 where its all people competing to see who throws up first its horrible youre going to be so let down
9091178 during the first night of mens team finals i couldnt sit still so i finally got on my treadmill and started walking i was scared i was going to jinx them so i wouldnt watch the actual competition id wait until i heard the commentaries calling the replay id watch the replay after they already finished but i get ulcers watching these kids
9091179 now as a spectator i sit at the edge of my seat and i do i feel like a mother that is anxiously awaiting for her child to compete and i know now how my parents must have felt i think were all kind of ready for a break
9091180 she move her body like a cyclone she make me want to do it all night long
9091181 companies will endure as a means of marshalling people and capital no other organisations set prices as efficiently or pursue market experiments so single mindedly

9091186 i am playing barbies as you can tell im not even listening to you you see how her knees snap i used to like that sound and how you can pose them so now the malibu barbie has her wedding dress on and shes on the way to the wedding
9091187 my barbies would stand at this kitchen and cook and heres the little dish rack
9091188 ive got the stuff and when i was set up in my full glory it was exciting to be over at my house playing barbies
9091189 ok i just found a pair of black silk bloomers and lace
9091190 all right i have a question for you did your barbie ever kiss ken
9091191 she definitely fell in love especially once ken or brad came on the scene
9091192 ah yeah but thats about all that wed figured out nap time nap time
9091193 there you go i dont remember that my barbies did that but im not saying for sure that they didnt
9091194 i have gigantic nordic flat size 11 feet but barbie got to wear the really cool shoes that i can never wear sometimes when i look at my feet i still have a flash that my feet are not right theyre not the right feet
9091195 for one thing my first barbies were white and i was keenly aware that i was black so i knew that i wasnt going to one day look in a mirror a magic mirror and look like barbie really it kind of broke the illusion that this was suppose to correlate to me in some way i just liked the cache of barbie one day id be a beautiful woman i would have long hair and big boobs id have fabulous clothes id have a ken id have a car it was the cache of barbie that i really really bought into
9091196 im still interested in barbies they were my life and i am living a domestic life that i was practicing as a girl i kid you not now id like to think that its a liberated domestic life but im deeply interested in household activities and i practiced when i was a girl and barbies was just an extension of playing that i did every weekend

9091201 heres how youre going to learn to ride a bike youre going to teach yourselves ok nobodys going to hold you up
9091202 its when it slows down that you start to tip over and if it just feels like its out of control you put your feet down
9091203 did you see me the way before i went down that way i was like gliding along
9091204 yeah i had it up for maybe about five feet maybe ill see if i can do it again

9091213 theres a silver lining to this norovirus outbreak the way hospitals are run in new zealand i dont expect this virus to be eradicated until well after the election and as long as the quarantine stays in place ill be untouchable no pesky visitors from the media select committees or helens office

9091215 i detect the hand of minister david cunliffe in this winston would have needed inside help to get through such tight security and who better than the health minister theres no doubt that the labour government wants desperately to get him into quarantine before he accepts more contributions winston has an addiction he just cant say enough is enough

9091227 this is pretty exciting im impressed with her ability to take on folks in power she obviously has a lot of moxie and i like that
9091228 i think he got a poke in the eye by the mccain campaign hes worked very hard been extremely loyal i dont think americans or minnesotans are going to think that sarah palin is experienced enough to be just a blink away from the presidency

9091274 a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of midnight sun that left her possession and each was unique
9091275 in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
9091276 i am sad for her but angry at her at the same time
9091277 noooooooo can someone please call email stalk her and tell her she must write midnight sun how can this happen why leave us this way we can wait but why indefinately who the hell leaked it they should be flogged i think im gonna cry we just want to know what edward is thinking when he is in the meadow with bella and then when he stays at her house im gonna cry
9091278 its funny because when it first leaked everyone was really excited because so many of the fans who read it were really hyping it up and that it was really good

9091329 when ruiz walked in the other day everybody got a huge boost myself included all the staff all the players because we know what quality he brings the whole team is getting a massive boost from this situation its okay talking about the boost weve now got to take that out onto the pitch and produce the goods on the pitch
9091330 hes fitted in straight away and its like hes been here all year
9091331 i know theres just nine games left so i want to try to work hard for the team and score as many goals as possible
9091332 i was very proud that toronto made a very good effort to bring me here and i have to respond on the field so i know i have pressure and i always like to play like that under pressure
9091333 ive got one eye on that and its a huge concern but ive really got to try and stay focused on this game today
9091334 i feel if we have to play short handed next weekend against chivas usa at home i think its an injustice to our fans who pay good money to come and watch us they expect a good product on the pitch
9091335 if youre not going to have that product on the pitch then its doing the fans a disservice
9091336 i had to pass french to move on in university
9091337 it was hard for me everybody learns differently it bothers me that well put pressure on some players and then they might not be able to play
9091338 as long as the vast amount of the television revenues and business sponsorships are generated in north america it is only natural that the tour needs to be able to showcase the product in english
9091339 imagine if tiger vijay and sergio spoke no english and made no effort to do so yes they would be recognized as good golfers but would the fans turn their tvs on to watch and would the corporations put up millions to sponsor the tour i would think not the lpga is protecting the future of their tour before they lose it due to lack of interest and lack of sponsors who cannot relate to the players
9091340 im also surprised that the lpga didnt think it would be such a big deal with people

9091466 its truly bizarrely absurd to hear mccainsters saturating the airwaves with praise for sarah palin as an inspired choice two days after the mccain campaign
9091467 so after criticizing obamas inexperience mccain picks someone with even less experience
9091468 the obama camp is already dumb enough to point out her inexperience heh thatll play well
9091469 wow just wow you should have picked hillary barack heres to breaking this countrys shameful male monopoly on power
9091470 personally i would have gone with romney romney is a winner he has won in business he has done well in politics
9091471 sarah palin on the ticket is a triple whammy shes young female and not a washington insider
9091472 he chose a running mate i can get excited about i just wish i could say the same for him
9091473 i really like this woman shes smart conservative pro drilling pro troops a looker and a scrapper in the political arena
9091474 the interesting thing to me though is that she doesnt seem to be a political insider and she seems to be kind of a bad ass
9091475 pro gun pro life pro energy lots of good stuff
9091476 gov palin of alaska actually seems to be a true small government conservative
9091477 who the hell is sarah palin and would america want her a failing mccain heartbeat away from the presidency
9091478 i disagree with mccain too much on foreign policy and distrust him too much on economics to actually vote for him but alaska gov sarah palin is an excellent conservative choice
9091479 i think that palin known for her own brand of maverick ness and having demonstrated executive talent is a great pick way to go john
9091480 the very thought that many of hillarys supporters will vote for mccain just because he chose a human being with breasts is just plain insulting
9091481 why because she has ovaries oh and shes even younger than barack obama
9091482 i might be able to get excited about this young lady she just might give mccains campaign the energy it really needs
9091483 shes got idealism and the courage of her convictions shes a milf if people really vote on that sort of thing
9091484 in the end sarah palin may add that final crack to the glass ceiling that hillary couldnt bring about

9091602 i got to read up and figure out who she is and where she stands mccains been out there but i have no idea who she is

9091605 i thought he was trying to pull a fast one trying to get the women that were in hillarys camp
9091606 not in the least i dont go for that kind of ploys
9091607 governor palin is extremely qualified and has a wonderful reputation as a fighter and reformer
9091608 she and john mccain share a commitment to our long held core values and roots limited government and a strong presence in the world as we face multiple threats to liberty and freedom
9091609 i think gov sarah palin a former mayor with a background of cleaning up state government is a great choice for vice president
9091610 sarah palin proves that sometimes it takes a mayor to clean up state government
9091611 governor palin is a strong pro life conservative with a proven track record of reform in alaska effectively bringing accountability and transparency to government
9091612 her experience as a chief executive of a state that is at the forefront of the energy debate will complement john mccains experience and leadership
9091613 the contrast between the reformer and the outsider palin and the consummate insider who has been a u s senator for over 20 years joe biden is just as stark as the contrast in this campaign for governor of north carolina
9091614 she has been mayor of a small town and served for less than two years as governor of a state with fewer people than the triangle for john mccain to think that those of us who supported hillary clinton will be drawn to him by putting a woman on the ticket is insulting choosing a woman as a running mate does not change the reality that john mccain does not support issues that women care about

9091619 one of the coolest things at this u s nationals was getting to see that scott kalitta car back on the track
9091620 it just depends on how intense that meeting was with nascar and how serious they are about the probation
9091621 im sure there are probations that are kind of like a slap on the hand and then there are probations where they might have you buy the shirt saying you do this again youre really in trouble thats really where the question lies its one word but there might be many levels to it
9091622 we dont want to see this escalate though we understand that beating and banging is part of the sport
9091623 have you ever heard of anybody explaining what happens inside the hauler
9091624 it means you cant do anything like what you did last week again
9091625 its nascars discretion what they feel like would be the correct penalty if you do the same thing again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that keep your postrace antics down to a minimum
9091626 the probation will be far back in their minds but its not going to change how they race and what they do i wish they would decide to wreck each other in the chase opener at new hampshire but i know thats not going to be the case
9091627 but the stuff afterward might be a little more subdued
9091628 we had three extremely important criminal cases and needed to take extraordinary measures
9091629 im sure all of them had some place they would rather be on a beautiful sunny august day
9091630 i told them walk out that door onto pearl street and summon the first 10 to 12 people you see
9091631 the prior plan was perceived as a sellout to the big oil companies
9091632 i have seen her go toe to toe with the oil industry in a way that a lot of democratic governors are afraid to do for being viewed as anti business
9091633 afterwards sarahs supporters were taunted at a republican party picnic
9091634 but she wasnt afraid to stand up to them shes a gutsy gal
9091635 they are a little embarrassed by the lack of trials
9091636 so they try and present the numbers in a way that shows a major increase
9091637 they told us they were closing the file that they were not pursuing it

9091640 n 1970 under company president charles peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox parc xerox palo alto research center research facility the facility developed many modern computing methods such as the mouse and the graphical user interface from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in 1973 a small minicomputer similar to a workstation and personal computer the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it in 1979 several apple computer employees including steve jobs visited xerox parc interested in seeing their developments jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the gui and mouse and began development of the apple lisa which apple introduced in 1983 the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc xerox later released a similar system to the alto the xerox star in 1981 as a workstation it was the first commercial system to incorporate various technologies that today have become commonplace in personal computers including a bit mapped display a window based gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and e mail the xerox star despite its technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing 16 000 per unit a typical xerox star based office would have cost 100 000 in the mid 1980s apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reached apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in 1984 and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse amongst the public

9091737 so youre pretty much awesome and i want to say
9091738 erisa provides elaborate requirements for the vesting of pension benefits but it does not provide automatic vesting of welfare benefits
9091739 protected from elimination only if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan provider had intended the welfare benefit to have vested despite not being obliged to do so by erisa
9091740 designed and treated as a defined pension benefit for nearly 40 years
9091741 the pensioner death benefit neither provides retirement income to employees nor results in a deferral of income by employees
9091742 moreover it could not be an accrued pension benefit since it is not an annual benefit and it does not commence at normal retirement age
9091743 the fact that a welfare benefit appears in a larger plan that also provides pension benefits does not change the character of that welfare benefit
9091744 the amount and calculation method of the pensioner death benefit the identity of the recipient of payment and the treatment of the pensioner death benefit for tax accounting and plan termination purposes are relevant details for administrators of the plan but they do not change the fundamental character of the benefit
9091745 the type of benefit provided not other considerations determines whether a plan is a pension plan or a welfare plan
9091746 the pensioners identify no authority stating that such detrimental reliance has significance under the facts of this case
9091747 nothing in the plan documents suggests that the pensioner death benefit vests during the life of the pensioner and the plan documents certainly do not state such vesting in clear and express language
9091748 under the circumstances the court is persuaded that the use of the plaintiffs photograph
9091749 constituted a republication which triggered a new statute of limitations
9091750 the purpose of the rule is to avoid an endless tolling of the one year statute of limitations thus sparing the courts from the litigation of stale claims involving events from years earlier
9091751 thus where the material at issue is republished in a new format intended to reach a new audience the statute of limitations will run anew from the date of the republication
9091752 clearly the defendants website presents an entirely different format for the use of the photograph than its installation on the sports club premises
9091753 intended primarily for the entertainment of the limited number of people who are already members and therefore on the premises
9091754 presumably directed at a far wider audience primarily comprised of those who are not members and whom the defendant is seeking to attract as new members
9091755 first appeared on its web site more than one year before this action was commenced
9091756 in the absence of fraud the fact that an offeree cannot read write speak or understand the english language is immaterial to whether an english language agreement the offeree executes is enforceable
9091757 when sun made the decision to insert itself between morales and the contract it created a situation where lack of mutual assent could and did occur
9091758 because i do not believe it was negligent or otherwise improper for morales to rely upon the translation provided by sun and because morales was not informed in the course of that translation that the agreement contained an arbitration clause i agree with the district court that morales did not manifest an intention to be bound by the arbitration clause
9091759 it was morales obligation to ensure he understood the agreement before signing
9091760 morales did not ask hodge to translate the document word for word or ask to take the agreement home and have it translated notwithstanding the fact that he testified that in the past he had paid someone to translate documents for him
9091761 while mutual assent is sometimes referred to as a meeting of the minds this phrase must not be construed too literally
9091762 acceptance is measured not by the parties subjective intent but rather by their outward expressions of assent
9091763 it will not do for a man to enter into a contract and when called upon to respond to its obligations to say that he did not read it when he signed it or did not know what it contained
9091764 morales entered into the agreement with sun without fraud or duress and he is bound by its arbitration clause
9091765 the problem is not simply morales ignorance of the language
9091766 the gravamen of this case is that sun the other party to the agreement took upon itself the task of translating the agreement for morales and in doing so failed to convey the entire contents of the agreement
9091767 however the law is also clear that there are certain circumstances where a persons inability to comprehend the language in which a contract is written may result in a lack of mutual assent
9091768 failure to realize that an arbitration provision was contained within the agreement was the direct result of hodges failure to properly translate the document
9091769 we are disappointed think the jury is wrong and we will be appealing
9091770 of course it is entirely unclear at this juncture whether discovery will reveal facts sufficient to support the existence of such a relationship
9091771 securities and other financial crimes prior to his becoming employed
9091772 during the communications with custom capital plaintiffs were asked a limited number of superficial questions that did not encompass the scope of the information or documentation that would be required to fully complete an application for a mortgage of any kind
9091773 this court joins the overwhelming number of other courts that have held that a mortgage broker does not qualify as a creditor under tila
9091774 regularly extends consumer credit if in any 12 month period the person originates more than one credit extension or one or more such credit extensions through a mortgage broker
9091775 plaintiffs do not allege that ccc was a party to the loan or acted as a creditor under tila rather the allegation is that ccc acted as a mortgage broker because ccc did not function as a creditor or lender in the transaction it cannot be held liable under tila
9091776 a s ccc recognized in its papers and at oral argument a broker may take on a fiduciary duty by performing tasks and or taking on obligations beyond that of an independent broker or traditional middleman
9091777 the court concludes that the amended complaint sufficiently alleges that ccc engaged in conduct as well as made representations to plaintiffs that created a fiduciary relationship with plaintiffs
9091778 did not have any meaningful communications with ccc that could even possibly give rise to a heightened duty on the part of ccc to plaintiffs
9091779 facts may come to light during the course of discovery
9091780 there was no reverse mortgage the plaintiffs claim that they intended to enter into a reverse mortgage but the application submitted by custom capital on behalf of plaintiffs was for a standard mortgage
9091781 he is accepting the allegations at face value and thats what they are allegations
9091782 i trust him posted on get rich slowly in oak grove identity politics only goes so far
9091783 they need to learn to cross the street before they leave for college
9091784 is so the truth and facts will be allowed to surface without the misuse of our words and biased opinions from mainstream local media
9091785 with all the biased reporting by the local mainstream can the bakery 4 bey and three other defendants in the kidnapping and torture case still receive a fair trial
9091786 do you see what i say usually the first time you say that they look at you like what but you have to see what i say in your mind if i have to draw it for you in the heat of the battle youre lost
9091787 but now looking back there are so many more things im aware of now that i had no understanding of last year
9091788 it puts things in perspective i think a lot has been said about the numbers that were put up last year but ive always been one to focus on the ones that matter the turnovers and the wins and the losses and those stats were very poor and most of that in this offense is correlated with the quarterback position
9091789 no matter what i could have told him or said or what we attempted to put him through in practice nothing prepares you for your first year doesnt matter if youre a freshman or not
9091790 hes better at recognizing defenses at understanding protections at knowing where hot outlets are when they do blitz and what to do he is leap years ahead of where he was last season different people see the light at different times
9091791 i say shes up in the stands she loves you throw her the ball once in a while
9091792 my first spring ball going into that fall camp and into the season i struggled with throwing the ball away thats a hard thing as a quarterback you want to make a play but sometimes the best play is dropping it down to a running back or throwing it to mom
9091793 there are so many more things that im aware of now that i had no understanding of last year
9091794 its understanding the opportunity you have i have every opportunity to take this thing wherever i want it to go
9091795 i know right from wrong now its a matter of becoming consistent with it its all on me recognizing it and doing it i want to play right now

9091797 perhaps these data suggest that calcium supplementation to be effective requires the addition of vitamin d supplementation
9091798 calcium nutrition is intimately linked to vitamin d status and if 80 nanomoles per liter represents a vitamin d replete status then a large segment of the population from 30 to 60 depending on the population being studied would be vitamin d insufficient

9091805 it is still premature to consider a treasury sponsored recapitalization in our view as capital depletion would not likely occur for several quarters
9091806 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9091807 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9091808 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9091809 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9091810 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9091811 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9091812 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want

9091817 its always nice to see your name up the leaderboard and this is the second week in a row ive been able to say that
9091818 ive also been saying all season that it has all to do with remaining patient and ive done that and now i am starting to see the fruits of that
9091819 the greens are the same for everyone else so theres no real point complaining
9091820 all i can do is focus on my own game and try and retain your patience on the greens
9091821 unfortunately you just cant get aggressive and i was just lagging every putt and trying to make sure i didnt three putt which i didnt manage to do
9091822 it was pretty solid from the outset we just played consistently well we came to the net well and lobbed well
9091823 this is a grand slam and you want to do your best i have to change my ticket its for tomorrow
9091824 its definitely a match which we can win and they are beatable
9091825 if we keep playing well and keep steady theres no reason why we cant win

9091870 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9091871 as a mother of 5 obviously shes done her jobs just fine up to now why arent men ever asked if they could do the job with children at home shell be there for her children just like others are for theirs her job just will be more public there are many many women out there that work long hard hours many without a supportive spouse who are also very good mothers when are we going to decide as a nation if we support women working if so why not the top jobs or if we expect them to stay home and be mothers exclusively if it can be done shes the gal to give it a whirl her family supports her and she isnt afraid of a good challenge as is shown by her sports history marathon running choice of state to live work in and having a downs baby voluntarily she has my full support i like the choices shes made so far in her public life and the few im aware of in her personal life and ill back her congratulations excellent choice they have thrown mccain to the wolves this woman may be the next best thing since sliced bread but if you think mccain wanted her i have a bridge in pittburgh thats forsale mccains too old for this nonsense i believe that the republican party really threw him to the wolves this is a terrible treatment of mccain you could see his own uneasiness with the choice during the interview at noon on nbc this is cruel to mccain and just shows the people of the country how little their needs or concerns are to them she is a beautiful woman great family and three cheers for motherhood but the public is not as stupid some day historians will write the truth about all this silly stuff jl in pittsburgh she has an impressive resume and a very interesting profile and she has 5 kids one of them is under 1 year old with down syndrome shes a super woman to all the right wingers so you want another 4 years of a president who listens to cheney you all are as stupid as w bush he is the most dumbest president we ever had what a mess we are in because of the republicans obama gets my vote what a cynical choice i hope to god the american people arent as shallow as some of the responses i see here come election day why is it that when sarah palin is asked about her children on 2 24 08 her reply is 4 children with no mention of her 5th is this the action of a prolifer hes got to be kidding i know he wants the soccer mom vote but does that mean he should pick one for his running mate still its an interesting choice by sen mccain even more interesting was her body language during and after the speech rather than turning to the senator as he clearly expected she seemed to dismiss him and focus her attention on basking in the support of the audience in the end however it seems to me she is just too small for the position inexperienced parochial and narrow minded things that are not a problem for the governor of alaska where the big decisions revolve around how to best divvy up the goodies amongst the constituents i suppose but certainly a problem on the national stage on the bright side the fanatic anti abortion crowd will probably love her with such a frivolous pick i would not be surprised if his nomination is contested at the convention i like not sure if this will make me vote for mccain but its a nice change from old white guys sounds like a gop version of obama and a ploy for women voters no matter i cant wait for the daily show and colbert report tonight this is a silly choice she is big fish in a tiny pond her executive experience vis a vis the national stage is a joke there were qualified female republicans the vp debate should be comical she cannot possible memorize all her lines by then and still campaign finally a strong female role model with great morals and ethics the democrats are seething senator mccains choice for v p is surprising but a great choice once again history have been made the republicans have a female running mate its time for america to bring fresh political leaders its time to let women take important roles in politics because women are more sensitive to the real issues of our society their roles as mothers and wives are the foundation of the family often overshadowed by men men are nothing without women as the batekes of the equatorial forest of congo say woman is the belt on mans pants
9091872 bold because mccain went way outside the washington d c establishment and chose someone who was hardly on the radar screen risky because she has no exposure to the rough and tumble of national politics i dont want to draw too close a comparison but the last time this happened was when the first president bush went with dan quayle
9091873 suggests that mccain and his advisers arent as confident about the direction of the race even given the ground theyve made up in the polls
9091874 so they decided its worth trading that argument away in order to target clintons supporters more directly
9091875 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9091876 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9091902 hey do you guys want to stop at the sportsmans
9091903 nada est cerrado ni ser definitivo antes de un mes
9091904 pese a los resultados vuelvo a pilotar en buenas condiciones
9091905 stoner es m s r pido pero el mundial ser para rossi
9091906 no estoy preocupado pese a que hoy los resultados no han sido positivos creo que ma ana podemos mejorar los tiempos
9091907 es importante que despu s de tanto restar empecemos a sumar hay que volver a coger el ritmo que ten a antes de la ca da de alemania y ahora que f sicamente estoy bien y ya puedo frenar con normalidad tengo que intentar recuperar las buenas sensaciones
9091908 aqu va a ser fundamental lograr una buena calificaci n porque la primera curva est muy cerca de la salida
9091909 pese a los resultados vuelvo a pilotar en buenas condiciones
9091910 stoner es m s r pido pero el mundial ser para rossi
9091911 tendremos que ver c mo llega cada equipo en el tramo final
9091912 pese a los resultados vuelvo a pilotar en buenas condiciones
9091913 stoner es m s r pido pero el mundial ser para rossi
9091914 el problema existe no me lo he inventado aunque no creo que michelin tenga que reaccionar por mis palabras sino por tratar de mejorar sus resultados en la pista
9091915 se est discutiendo la posibilidad de un neum tico nico para el pr ximo a o por supuesto nuestra postura es la misma que el a o pasado cuando ezpeleta ya tante a pilotos y equipos sobre esta opci n nos gustar a seguir con la competencia y por tanto con el actual reglamento tenemos once corredores que es casi el m ximo de nuestra capacidad
9091916 estoy indeciso con los neum ticos porque he probado unos que me gustaban y luego no a n no se que hacer pero es evidente que la situaci n no es tan dram tica como en brno
9091917 eso es algo que hay que valorar con el equipo y no depende s lo de mis deseos
9091918 pese a los resultados vuelvo a pilotar en buenas condiciones
9091919 stoner es m s r pido pero el mundial ser para rossi
9091920 con los que tengo estoy ya bien lo que m s me importa ahora es que la plantilla se quede en esos 22 23 jugadores
9091921 ha sido un precio demasiado alto por amor al deporte a su familia al pa s
9091922 en esa ocasi n no se quiso hacer p blico para no preocupar a mi madre pues en ese momento el m dico de estados unidos le dijo si quieres a tu cuerpo tienes que terminar tu carrera en este momento pero l dijo que no porque ten a otros objetivos que cumplir
9091923 esa es la verdad y se ha llegado a ese punto porque jefferson ha forzado demasiado su cuerpo es decir ha maltratado demasiado a su organismo
9091924 es un precio demasiado alto pero l lo quiso hacer nadie lo oblig a nada lo hizo por amor a l mismo a su familia y a su pa s no se buscar culpables habr que tener fe en dios para que no comience tan pronto o que no comience nunca
9091925 con 25 a os hacer tour y vuelta ser a imposible
9091926 para la vuelta es bueno que exista un enfrentamiento entre dos corredores a la gente le gusta eso
9091927 no esa no es una motivaci n especial la motivaci n es intentar ganar la prueba de mi pa s y devolver el cari o a toda la gente que me ha apoyado para mi sastre es un candidato a la victoria final ojal fuera m s f cil para mi que para l pero no es as si dice esto es porque cada uno intenta quitarse la presi n de como puede
9091928 con 25 a os hacer dos grandes en este caso giro y vuelta ya es muy complicado pero ser a imposible o como m nimo muy dif cil hacer tour y vuelta se requiere estar m s curtido con 28 o 29 a os se podr a intentar
9091929 sab a que muchos equipos ten an este puesto cubierto como el unicaja el madrid o el tau el bar a en cambio era el nico que la ten a pero eso no puedo decir que me sorprendiera tanto
9091930 soy alero pero en la penya tambi n jugaba de 4 para cambiar el ritmo presionar y abrir m s el campo ahora espero tener m s protagonismo para jugar de alero no s lo en el tiro sino tambi n para repartir asistencias y dar m s juego de lo que he hecho en el joventut
9091931 quiero dar lo m ximo no s lo en defensa y dentro del equipo sino tambi n en ataque el bar a tiene jugadores ofensivos muy buenos como navarro lakovic y basile por lo que no tendr la presi n de meter 15 puntos por partido pero espero tener m s responsabilidad en ataque
9091932 soy m s listo en la pista que antes y en eso me ayud a to soy mejor defensor y m s jugador de equipo y quiero seguir siendo una referencia en ataque
9091933 cada posici n est bien cubierta y se tienen los recambios adecuados
9091934 hay equipos que sobre el papel son favoritos y luego tanto fichaje caro no sabe jugar junto
9091935 qu voy a decir que puedo terminar en el podio
9091936 lo importante ser no caerse si no llueve ya ser peligroso pero como caigan cuatro gotas no quiere ni pensarlo
9091937 en este inicio tienes poco a ganar y mucho que perder
9091938 a lo mejor no gana el mejor equipo sino el que es capaz de arriesgar m s
9091939 my grandparents and my aunts and my uncle and my little brother are out there
9091940 were just telling them dont play around out there go ahead and do what you have to do and put everything together
9091941 my sons probably going to have to get the police to get her out of there because shes not going to leave that house
9091942 he reported to the king on the current situation and he will return to bangkok today
9091943 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
9091944 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
9091945 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
9091946 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
9091947 there are now up to 3 000 police deployed outside government house
9091948 i am convinced that the military will not forcibly crack down on us
9091949 pad must go ahead and intensify the protest we think that more unions will join us and it will lead to more airport closures
9091950 it doesnt get any closer to death than they were
9091951 he was just getting weaker and weaker and you hate to see that
9091952 within two minutes of making the incision they announce that the miracle of life has occurred
9091953 if you could have been inside my body i was just going nuts it was crazy
9091954 i know its hard for people to get to that point to donate something of a loved ones to save someone but its incredible
9091955 we are planning as if there are zero changes in their offense defense and special teams
9091956 i dont think that there would be significant changes because they are successful in what they do
9091957 you look at a tom brady or a peyton manning they might be a little more accurate but not too much they might have a stronger arm but not too much its really their decision making
9091958 its getting their team in the right play at the right time its reading the right guy its making the right checks its checking the ball down when you need to its all those little things
9091959 when we really look back to last season when we just let the offense take care of itself let the reads take the ball to whoever is supposed to get it on that play thats when we had our best offensive days
9091960 when we spent too much time trying to force the ball into a couple guys hands we didnt get in as good a rhythm
9091961 hes getting a lot of reps in two minute drills
9091962 we had a two minute situation wednesday at the end of practice
9091963 hes just got to do it over and over and get comfortable he has to understand exactly what were trying to get accomplished and manage the time situations like when to throw it down the field when to check it down when to take our timeouts when to get out of bounds
9091964 tims pocket presence is something well continue to work on
9091965 brett favre i think had 28 000 snaps under center for the green bay packers tims had about 900 so once we get him up to about the 20 000 mark well be in good shape
9091966 sometimes that also goes with not always having to be an athlete and run around but sometimes sitting around and waiting on the next read to the last second and getting out of there
9091967 but it first starts with the decision to stay in the pocket
9091968 tim is always in attack mode hes in attack mode during stretch in practice
9091969 i love running out on the field going against an opponent before the game i love the whole experience of driving over here as a freshman i actually cried a little bit when i first drove over here the gator walk its all a great experience
9091970 the gator walk something about that is just overwhelming that youre here at florida i never thought id be here coming down and seeing all the fans here thats when you know its game time
9091971 just the atmosphere of the whole game being here in gator nation has really made me even more anxious to play in the games because ive been here in the fall and seen what the atmosphere is like its one of the craziest atmospheres around
9091972 you get to go out and hit someone else you practice so long and youve met for so long now you wait through spring ball and now is the time to see what they really can do and you have a chance to watch them its just fun to see if youve really prepared them and they are ready to go play for you
9091973 its a culmination of a lot of work when you get to game day its like lets go play and game day should be easier than practice and thats really the mantra for us what we go by work work work push em push em push em game day enjoy it because its not going to be anything like practice is its going to be a lot more fun
9091974 america comes alive when college football season starts we all know that i cant wait weve been out here in the winter and the spring and the summer and walk throughs and ive never been here on game day but this is what its all about the enthusiasm the passion the emotion the students the fans ive seen this place on television ive lost track of how many times ive watched florida on tv and i finally get to walk out here as a coach its pretty special
9091975 just running in the stadium the crowd the electricity that flows around this place theres nothing like it
9091976 game day is game weekend for us friday night we go downtown and walk around we eat there and see people we know saturday we go to publix and then park and go to the gator walk we go to emerson hall and tijuana flats and then into the stadium its a ritual there is so much energy in gainesville and its great to see the gator nation come together
9091977 its family fun and fellowship we get to our parking at 8 with a bunch of friends no matter what time the game is we have the tailgate catered its grown into a huge production whats great is the my two daughters who are 14 and 11 cant wait that gives me goosebumps ill tell you those seven saturdays are probably my favorite seven days of the year
9091978 it means i get to fly my orange and blue plane to gainesville stay at magnolia plantation and go the game early so were in our seats when they go here come the gators the great thing about going to gainesville is that i get a year older and they stay the same age there are two kinds of game day the blowouts and the tight games im a ball of nerves for the big games i love the blowouts
9091979 it means everything i grew up in gainesville and theres just nothing else like it its exciting theres a look in everybodys eyes its an intangible feeling that is difficult to describe i love it
9091980 definitely this is going to be a very good first test for us when you look at the things they do on offense
9091981 hawaii usually throws a lot of short passes and screens but im sure after looking at our tape from last year theyre going to take their shots down the field and see what happens
9091982 this game is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9091983 this will be a chance for the secondary to make a name for itself in the first game
9091984 i think our coverage is what has improved the most just reading routes and knowing whats going on and being more confident everything is fluid now it feels natural i feel like ive been a corner forever now wondy has also grown up a lot since last season hes got great athletic ability i dont have anything to say about whether we have to prove ourselves theyll see after we play hawaii and all the passes we intercept
9091985 im real comfortable with him behind us will hill has also come in and done a good job and we trust him too
9091986 true freshman omar hunter had four days of practice in a row heading into game week and we began to see some things that got us excited lawrence marsh has separated himself as a guy that we will count on playing for us the area is much improved than it was a year ago the defensive line and corners are way ahead of where they were one year ago
9091987 we lost our quarterback and our four starting receivers and eight or nine guys on offense
9091988 me being a new coach and june going to smu thats why were an underdog we dont take it personal its just the way it is
9091989 its different in that when i came in 99 they had a lot of losing years
9091990 the staff and players turned it from a loser into a winner they had losing attitudes and you had to work on that now they have winning attitudes theyve won a lot of ball games so they dont think that way you dont have to turn them over to be winners theyre defending champions of the wac western athletic conference
9091991 we played georgia last year and i think florida is at least 1 or 2 with a heisman trophy winner and playing at the swamp thats a big challenge i believe in my coaches and my players but its a big challenge
9091992 ive been to a lot of bowl games the atmosphere at this game was unbelievable a lot of it was because of our fans and the georgia fans the hotels were packed it was really a super bowl type atmosphere

9092002 has proved a problem not a blessing for the democratic candidate
9092003 dissatisfaction may have appeared to be more focused on obama in this particular poll because the question was asked during a time when there was more media coverage of obama for his overseas trip had the question been asked at a different time or had the pollsters tried to probe beneath the surface of this superficial question we might have obtained a better insight into what the public was thinking
9092004 many thanks for such an informative latin syllabus it really helps with managing expectations

9092009 the goal of this testing was to compare the throughput capabilities of esx 3 5 with netapp storage using fc iscsi and nfs protocols in a real world environment
9092010 we filled this to 70 ran it with a random write workload for 3 days and then ran the benchmark and we compared it with current fc technology
9092011 for what its worth personally certainly i dont necessarily represent emc in this context i appreciate having as formidable a competitor as network appliance with other competitors we compete with them and its a slow waltz but with you folks its a tango it makes us better win or lose with any individual customer and in the end its good for the industry and the customers
9092012 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
9092013 to cover war costs into the early months of a new administration those amounts combined would represent the highest level of military spending since the end of world war ii adjusted for inflation
9092014 m ore resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11

9092027 his best bet is to put two girls up ill tell ya one thing one of us is going home
9092028 its just stressful now i cant breathe its gonna be so crazy from here on out
9092029 if you have to do something keesha i wont be mad at you ill understand
9092030 ok renny whatever you think but i was in the kitchen and you need to calm down just calm down
9092031 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9092032 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9092033 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9092034 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9092035 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9092036 he only really looks at you when hes hurting you
9092037 when he couldnt hurt you with the nail he was staring at the floor
9092038 he started doing it when i came to stay with him at his home in little top my mom she was pathetic its no wonder i ended up spending most of my childhood with him she didnt have a lot of money and that would be the polite way to say it the impolite way would be to say she spent it on heroin my uncle he didnt respect my mom and he didnt have much respect for me neither
9092039 when he got to doing it i was always angry and ashamed of myself after he would say ill make ya feel good and i didnt know the first few times that he was lying it didnt make me feel any good it made me feel angry real angry part of the reason i think i was angry though was he wouldnt let me go out and play with the other kids said kids were always getting up to no good when it was him that was no good
9092040 i remember though when my mom came to visit once with my aunt judy aunt judy paid for my mom to travel to see me i always thought it was unfair how my mom got aunt judy and i got him uncle otis though he shut up real good when my mom came stopped touching me too i dont think it was that he was afraid of getting caught though you see he didnt respect women my uncle thought they deserved the treatment some got from their husbands i dont know if he was ever married but i dont think he was when my mom showed up it was like he didnt notice me anymore suddenly i was mommys little angel and i was invisible to him
9092041 it was like i had become the sun and if he looked at me for more than a few seconds his eyes would burn not out of fear though something else my mom would always cry and say she loved me and would hold me real tight like she couldnt stand being more than two centimeters from me it was funny how she used to switch like that not caring about me none one second and then pouring her emotion over me the next like i was her saving grace something about that rubbed my uncle the wrong way like he hated all the affection she gave me was jealous of it i still remember this one time while she and aunt judy had been staying at his house shed raided his fridge and made me a sundae my uncle had a sweet tooth always kept butterscotch ice cream in the freezer but never let me have any that was probably the tastiest sundae ive ever had ill never forget the look on his face when he saw me eating it
9092042 things were fine until the day she left i remember her hugging and kissing me for what felt like hours lying to me by saying shed be back soon then she got into the car with aunt judy and drove away and thats when he started hurting me it was the same thing hed been doing before but he wasnt holding back this time i could tell he was doing it like that because he thought i deserved it because id been hogging all the attention i started hurting a lot then it got to the point where i could barely walk
9092043 i told him what he was doing to me was wrong i told him soon somebody would notice but this just made him madder and somehow i knew that if i spoke one word to anybody hed kill me i decided i was just gonna have to bite my lip and take it and i could have too if it hadnt been for the dream that i started having
9092044 the dream was always the same every night it was terrible i would wake up shaking and crying i started
9092045 i would find myself somehow or another in a great big float you know the kind that they have in parades and it would be the most beautiful float in the parade all covered in pink lace and sprinkled in rose petals though there was never anybody there to see it would just be going down the road like itd been driving itself with me on it and soon id want to get off but my feet would always be stuck like they were stuck in cement and then the float would drive out of the city and find its way onto some forgotten country road itd be kicking up clouds of dirt getting all those fine pink laces covered in it suddenly id feel my heart pick up like someone was watching me now nobodyd cared to watch before but now someone did someone had gone to a lot of trouble to come way out here and watch my float putter down some miserable country road thats when the dream got bad
9092046 the float would come to a stop and finally id be able to get off and stretch my legs and then id turn around and there wouldnt be a float any more just a big ol wheat field as far as i could see and id start running up and down the wheat not really knowing why cause i wasnt having any fun and then id look down and notice a bright red spot on the front of my dress the spot would always be a surprise no matter how many damn times i found it and id lift up my dress to see where it was coming from and id find my panties soaked redder than a winter sunset i hadnt gotten my period yet then so you can imagine my surprise and the mess i would be making itd literally be gushing like i was having a years worth of periods all at once but at the time id thought i was bleeding to death or something then id feel those eyes on me again and id cover myself up feeling real embarrassed but that embarrassment didnt last long because then id start to panic
9092047 and when i heard a harsh growl my blood would run cold as ice and it would feel like somebody had just stuck an apple down my throat i dont remember ever being more scared than when i heard that growl not ever
9092048 and then id start to run run fast through the wheat and droplets of blood would sprinkle down beneath me leaving a trail where id been and i would hear it behind me tearing and smashing through the wheat getting closer and closer fear would clutch at my lungs like a bad flu and my legs would start to get weaker and weaker finally theyd go completely numb liked id just jumped into a cold pool and id fall down the worst part of the dream was waiting for it to get to me hearing its beast snout sniffing the ground sniffing my blood and the swish swash of the wheat being pushed out of its way then id see it and the sight would be enough to haunt me forever id see an ugly fanged visage staring at me hungrily from atop a huge muscled body that was neither man nor animal its eyes would be filled with my blood each a scorching red like the devils eyes and its body would be bristling with hair and a weeks worth of appetite
9092049 it would spring on top of me this animal thing its hot vile breath assaulting my face id feel it slide its bulging member inside of me feel its cruel gaze burning down at me from those sapphire eyes it would go at me again and again driving its swollen rod into me threatening to tear me up the middle and then it would withdraw and blood would come fountaining out from between my legs thered be more blood than i knew i had and it would lick up all the blood with its long snake tongue like a cat licking up spilled milk id scream scream until i was blue in the face and itd just keep going ravishing me again and again stopping only to lap up the blood
9092050 when it was done itd lean in close and kiss me on the lips like my mother did only it would use its tongue and get blood all over my face and id scream some more and it would just go on kissing me i can still see the satisfaction in its wild ketchupy eyes the satisfaction that it had gotten from taking everything from me and leaving me to die
9092051 thats when i realized he had taken more from me than just my virginity he had taken my will to live

9092188 this carnival will be a jumping off point making a statement reflecting who we are im dismayed in some ways with the seeming lack of momentum of social justice movements we need to reinvigorate the counterculture movement and thats why pi is here we are good at bringing people together its a magical place here worlds collide
9092189 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players i said something to peter kenyon a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
9092190 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
9092191 i dont know anything because i have not spoken to peter for the last two days
9092192 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too
9092193 but at the moment what is happening on the pitch is the only important thing for me for my players to play well against tottenham is what matters
9092194 if you dont talk to them youll never get to know them
9092195 politically adults tend to call names and not discuss problems but children tend to ask the question
9092196 kids dont know other kids are homeless its sobering to a 12 year old when confronted with issues of homelessness the general public never meets people who are homeless only those like themselves through this experience next time folks are faced with the issue they will have new perspective
9092197 this is an opportunity to sit and meet with folks youve never met and exchange ideas
9092198 are you willing to fundamentally understand that were here to take care of one another
9092199 were here to give to the children of homeless families to make it memorable for their trip to st
9092200 you dont have to be liberal or conservative just bring a meal and talk
9092201 even though some delegates wont pay any attention to what the demonstrators are talking about its not a deterrent there will be massive media intensely focused on st paul
9092202 the plight of homelessness is almost off the radar screen in terms of media coverage these days with the foreclosure debt and housing crisis it should bring attention to the fact that homelessness is growing the factors that lead to homelessness are not being diminished
9092203 there are more homeless families now than ever before and we want people to be aware of that
9092204 this is a picnic where peoples eyes will be opened
9092205 really its almost a post graduate project collections can be so broad and complicated so it was very interesting to me to watch the process unfold and see how we could actually talk about collections
9092206 i thought it to be simple i know what collecting is
9092207 it was great to bring these guys in and watch them fire questions at the burnets why this
9092208 philippe really made it clear that the key element to any working group is to function democratically
9092209 we started exploring collecting ideas versus objects multiple kinds of objects or a single type of object
9092210 and it was like a lead balloon totally silent and i realized it was really a live situation there was an out and they didnt take it
9092211 and we wanted to represent the corruption of that truth
9092212 for teen issues but even at my age too its that the worlds not what they told us it would be and we must reconcile expectation with experience
9092213 but the project provided me with a more realistic perspective of art collections and collectors
9092214 talking about collections in this group was a passionate base for discussion
9092215 as a chinese i really got very excited last night it was beyond my imagination from the very beginning i could tell its about china not propaganda we he and friends who watched the ceremony together cheered from the deepest part of our hearts
9092216 its more than a sporting event its a party for the world and china is the host and we want people around the world to see what china is like now
9092217 nothing runs like a deere nothing stinks like a john
9092218 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9092219 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9092220 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9092221 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9092222 certainly ive been preparing for the season opener for some time from a film standpoint its good to get back out there on the field and do more physical activity
9092223 i feel i got in some good practices this week i thought that was important
9092224 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9092225 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9092226 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase

9092250 the baby will have tests done to see if hes obese or were dealing with hyperthyroidism
9092251 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9092252 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming

9092273 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and you know im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans
9092274 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at top of ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9092275 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9092276 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9092277 an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9092278 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9092279 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bush s failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9092280 i think that campaigns start getting these uh uh hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9092281 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9092282 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9092298 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
9092299 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
9092300 the incidence is higher because the groups that are most impacted are highly represented in new york city men who have sex with men immigrants from certain parts of the world
9092301 they are highly represented here and for that reason we have three times the incidence of the rest of the united states
9092302 we are doing additional things to make sure we are reaching the target populations
9092303 one of our new prevention efforts is social network testing where we take people who are highly impacted sex workers men who have sex with men gay men and hispanics and ask people to bring their friends in to be tested that serves two functions one is to get people into treatment if theyre positive and the other is to interrupt the epidemic through knowing their status so they are not giving it out inadvertently to other people

9092309 were a fast tempo offense our objective is to get them tired and we made some big plays on that
9092310 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
9092311 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
9092312 we just thought if we had a chance to move forward wed take advantage of it
9092313 theyve both epitomized the professionalism that we pride ourselves on and are very talented guys their presence on the club speaks for itself
9092314 he came into the season as the last man on the roster
9092315 i remember the last day of spring training here in the clubhouse we were talking about trying to get an advance consent to go to the minor leagues if the time came during the season and here we are five months later and announcing an extension on his contract because of the great job hes done in the rotation
9092316 in the case of erstad we knew going in the character the work ethic and the professionalism hes shown throughout his entire career
9092317 with some of the struggles with some of the other outfielders with michael bourn struggling in the early stages of his career and carlos lee going down i dont know where wed be without darin with the standpoint of his playing ability and the standpoint of his clubhouse presence it fits perfectly with the blueprint we tried to put together for quality guys on the club

9092321 this award reflects many months of coordinated effort by michelins military tire team as well as our logistics subcontractor science applications international corp saic
9092322 we realize the critical nature of supplying parts for u s military operations around the world and we hope this award further validates dsccs selection of michelin for its ground tire privatization initiative contract last year
9092323 matc is extremely proud of our performance record with the aircraft tires privatization initiative contract
9092324 we appreciate the u s government putting its trust in michelin along with our partner lockheed martin ms2 to get the right aircraft tires to our men and women in the armed services while they concentrate on their mission at hand it is an honor to be awarded the silver best value medal
9092325 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9092326 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9092327 i am satisfied that both submissions were evaluated fairly and in a manner consistent with the rfp
9092328 the rfp establishes the rules of the game and in that sense its provisions must control the evaluation process in fairness to the two proponents who responded to the rfp and to those who may have chosen not to respond to it it would be wrong to treat the rfp as an invitation to negotiate rather the rfp is a document that triggers a competitive process where proposal submissions are subject to evaluation as prescribed with clarity in the rfp

9092331 theres no doubt about it we picked several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
9092332 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
9092333 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
9092334 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
9092335 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
9092336 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
9092337 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and theyre made out of meat
9092338 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
9092339 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take too long do you have any idea the life span of meat
9092340 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
9092341 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
9092342 oh there is a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat
9092343 youre not understanding are you the brain does the thinking the meat
9092344 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
9092345 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you getting the picture
9092346 finally yes they are indeed made out meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
9092347 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentients swap ideas and information the usual
9092348 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anyone home that sort of thing
9092349 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
9092350 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
9092351 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
9092352 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
9092353 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
9092354 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
9092355 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
9092356 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you have probed youre sure they wont remember
9092357 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
9092358 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
9092359 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
9092360 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
9092361 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone

9092383 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9092384 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9092385 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9092386 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9092387 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9092388 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9092389 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies

9092409 this is a jewel of a space its right in the middle of everything
9092410 youve got a space that closes in as you go up so you lose square footage just in height alone
9092411 its a great combination of both to be able to combine the access of the artists and the people who make the music and also the people who consume the music

9092487 taking on possibly the greatest issue of our time the malignant force of religion in the world christopher hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion through a close and learned reading of the major religious texts citing numerous historical instances in which sexual repression and outrageous acts of violence have been committed in the name of god he argues for a more secular life based on science and reason in which hell is replaced by the hubble telescopes awesome view of the universe and moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix

9092500 i am saddened to learn of the death of gladys powers who may have been the worlds last surviving female service veteran from the first world war
9092501 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
9092502 although they may not have realised it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those servicewomen who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
9092503 the joining of these two great companies represents a strategic move that better aligns both organizations with the newly formed miller coors joint venture building upon each companies recognized strengths in delivering exemplary customer service and developing long standing relationships within local operating communities
9092504 this is a joining of two great organizations and we fully intend to build on the strong consumer loyalty to the miller brands and milwaukee that has been created under the leadership of miller brands milwaukee executives steve johnson and mike gallagher
9092505 this deal gives us long term continuity and combines the forces of a bigger better and stronger service organization to serve our customers and offer consumers an expanded array of top flight brands

9092515 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9092516 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9092517 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9092518 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9092519 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9092520 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9092521 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9092522 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9092523 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9092524 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market

9092526 he hargreaves trained on the night before the game with the rest of the team but when he came to us in the morning he said he was still feeling his knee
9092527 he felt that he wasnt fit enough to play and after that theres nothing more you can do if the player decides himself you have to accept it
9092528 we would like to have played him and got him back into things because he hasnt had enough football in the last year
9092529 we need to get him back and we are disappointed hes been training with the first team for 10 days and as i say theres nothing more we can do we gave him the right preparation his training programmes were at the right tempo the right speed of training everything was done in the right manner to get him back for this game so thats the disappointment
9092530 the sending off was unfortunate but the fact he had already been booked meant he had to go
9092531 could not wait to get them in at the break
9092532 i cant deny that zenit deserved to win we played better when we were 2 0 down and we created quite a few chances to score but i have to say that zenit shaded it

9092534 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals

9092621 you must go to baghdad brother its the most beautiful city ive ever seen
9092622 al khwarizmi receives his wisdom from a higher truth the house of wisdom has a secret room that only he enters thats where he attains knowledge
9092623 no but others have told me that the room contains a special cup
9092624 only those who truly love god will see the untold secrets of the universe when they look into it
9092625 but thats impossible even if that were so god only communicates with prophets and the last prophet has come and gone
9092626 the scholars there spoke of it in terms too deep for my understanding you should join them in baghdad brother with all your teachings and writings im sure they would be honored to let you study in the house of wisdom
9092627 friend this means you will be leaving us for the past eleven years i have been honored and blessed to listen to your teachings i have learned so much from you as if you were my own father and now my soul grieves as you depart
9092628 separation in our reality is a natural process of the world but the beauty that has nourished our hearts always remains
9092629 i know that you deserve to be among the greatest scholars for this i will smile

9092631 you speak as if i should abandon knowledge and just be satisfied
9092632 arent you satisfied with what we have gods love is not something you can only find in one part of the world it presents itself everywhere
9092633 what about our love marwan does his love not present itself in our union
9092634 romantic love and divine love are not the same my dear
9092635 this is not something for you to easily understand destiny is guiding us on a new path nawal qurtuba will soon fall and its best for me to find a brighter future in the east before those dark days arrive
9092636 god brought me here this is all his doing i am a servant to his will
9092637 i am marwan ibn abdel jalil i come from the west from al andalus
9092638 they have yet to dismantle conventional thought and govern society in the manner of the respected abbasid caliph
9092639 your ideas and philosophies are revolutionary and must be implemented in government if we are to remain prosperous and civilized those mindful of god know that outcomes of such balance between reason and revelation
9092640 i would like to study here and earn a living and grow in my knowledge of spiritual and worldly matters god knows how much i hunger for learning but first i would like to visit the house of wisdom and know what secrets lie within
9092641 logic and reason have their place in this world but they are not the answers to all questions
9092642 i seek the key of knowledge that unlocks the life of transcendent reality
9092643 such knowledge does not need a tangible key the key is within
9092644 this is also true depending on ones perception but only those who truly love god will see the beauty
9092645 that is a task that you seemed to have mastered
9092646 to the world i am a mathematician and philosopher they may hold me in high esteem but does that mean they truly know me the mystics say a pile of holy books stacked on a donkey is still a donkey my numbers my words my letters these are all things that people know me for but my inward nature is only known to god himself
9092647 perhaps you should test it out yourself fill the cup with the fountains water and before you consume it look into the reflection and you will find the answer to your questions
9092648 cest difficile de vivre uniquement de la musique maurice alors quailleurs on vous accueille bras ouverts

9092661 lord help us come together to solve our nations problems in a spirit of respect and civility
9092662 lord grant repentance to those who fight tooth and nail in favor of the holocaust of unborn babies in the name of choice
9092663 eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
9092664 according to the 2001 land law the lake itself should be inalienable state land so its ownership cannot be transferred for longer than 15 years during which time the function of the property must not change
9092665 many of the families have strong legal claims to the land under the land law
9092666 we are very concerned what will happen to our houses and livelihoods and the possibility that we will have to move
9092667 we ask the company to halt the process of filling in the lake and meet the community to discuss the issue
9092668 i think i speak for all families when i say the boeung kak lake area is very easy to live in
9092669 even poor people can make a living catching snails in the lake the water is polluted but this is being used as an excuse to force people out in the name of development
9092670 i want to stress the compensation offer is not acceptable to the people
9092671 if the government wishes to develop boeung kak they should do so through a legal process with the participation of communities that live around the lake
9092672 there is an expectation that a lot more evictions will happen and that evictions in the works for some time will now get the green light
9092673 we are concerned that a number of evictions could be carried out after the election and we call on the government to respect the laws of cambodia and their international human rights obligations
9092674 energy conservation is by far the best use of money
9092675 the question is why we are not doing more of this
9092676 assumption that as long as its got a renewable tag on it we can carrying on using energy at the level we have been
9092677 im not at all surprised to find a company trying to build new coal fired power stations using unfounded assumptions about the renewables industry
9092678 essentially what they are doing is taking a very simplistic analysis and arguing that we need to massively back up for the worst possible scenarios
9092679 its not surprising given their agenda is all about building massive coal fired power stations
9092680 under the current trading system for power you just wouldnt build it so clearly there has to be some sort of encouragement
9092681 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9092682 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9092683 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9092684 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9092685 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9092686 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9092687 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9092688 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9092689 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9092690 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9092691 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9092692 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9092693 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9092694 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9092695 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9092696 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9092697 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9092698 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9092699 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9092700 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9092701 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9092702 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9092703 as the mother of five i know how to multi task and i will continue to promote the path of reform that we set out on together in the state of alaska
9092704 i was bowled over when i heard the news what a surprise
9092705 i dont think anyone saw this coming i thought pawlenty romney possibly lieberman obviously we support mccain were going to support his choice of running mate were trying to figure out what it all means
9092706 any elected leader in alaska is in favor of opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling
9092707 the ensign doesnt get to tell the admiral what to do
9092708 it is useful in increasing the use of gas as a bridge fuel to a clean energy future
9092709 in rural alaska particularly many people are facing a choice between feeding their families and heating their homes and they could use this payment from the states energy generated surplus to cover some of those bills
9092710 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9092711 her most recent effort has been to sue the u s fish and wildlife service to remove the polar bear from the endangered species list putting big oil before sound science as unbelievable as this may sound this actually puts her to the right of the bush administration
9092712 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling pushed for more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science
9092713 she has not merely talked about the energy crisis she has actively worked to create solutions
9092714 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9092715 governor palin characterizes mccains flip flop on drilling offshore as a positive step in his transformation from maverick to big oils best friend
9092716 she has implored mccain to change his position against drilling in the arctic something she will have plenty of opportunities to pursue as his running mate
9092717 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9092718 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9092719 one of the things were trying to accomplish as an organization is to move the environment from being a partisan poltical football an issue that republicans disdain and democrats assume that theyve cornered the market on
9092720 yes the signs get hit all the time and yes we could probably have the cracked panels after the insurance company looked at them
9092721 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
9092722 yes i do well to be angry angry enough to die
9092723 but women will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith love and holiness with propriety

9092730 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what
9092731 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9092732 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9092733 and he wears this uniform when scott linebrink comes back this ballclubs going to be awesome and hes going to come back the next couple days thats the guy we really need to get this thing set up to go
9092734 i think today we were most encouraged by the fact usually the second day of throwing has always gone the best and its the days weve had no activity or no throwing the next day has always been a bear for us
9092735 and we had thursday with a total day off and didnt do anything with the shoulder and today went well
9092736 pitching coach don cooper thought i looked better than the time before that was encouraging just because weve been battling that just knocking the rust off the day after inactivity
9092737 i know me im not thinking to insert him right back in the eighth inning role
9092738 as much as i would love to be able to do that we could not feel comfortable about that right now we have to get him back in action first see how hes doing we have other guys weve seen do well so we are going to lean to those guys until we see more from scotty and feel better about him doing that
9092739 mccains palin announcement today was like a fifth day of the democratic convention
9092740 what a mismatch it looks like some take your daughter to work day event
9092741 if its the last thing i do i will get that ban dropped
9092742 they will be nice enough to let me visit him
9092743 pit bulls are actually very sweet they should put money in to anti cruelty laws
9092744 we want him to go out of state so he doesnt come back
9092745 they havet solved a thing until they eliminate this ban
9092746 i think if that happens the chicago mayor richard m daley would have a really good chance to have the summer olympics there in 2016 i guarantee you because that citys going to go crazy
9092747 playing the cubs why not they have a good ballclub i think they have a lot of talent for the city i think it would be outstanding
9092748 im a big time lou piniella fan general manager jim hendry is a good friend ive got derrek lee henry blanco carlos zambrano mark derosa ive got a lot of guys there that are my friends i will root for my friends i cannot say i will root for the cubs because youre a south sider or youre not
9092749 ive never had an opportunity to vote in the united states but i appreciate obamas opinion
9092750 that mans a true sox fan i have to tell people in chicago dont misunderstand what he wants to say
9092751 some people out there are ignorant and say were not going to vote for him because hes a white sox fan that will happen i dont think he needs the white sox fans vote he just told the truth he likes the white sox hes always been a south sider and i guarantee you a few people here like him too like myself

9092852 the pakistan muslim league n on monday finally quit the five month old ruling coalition because of differences with the pakistan peoples party on the issues of reinstatement of the deposed judges and unilateral nomination of ppp co chairman asif zardari as a presidential candidate
9092853 the pml n also announced that it would field former chief justice saeeduz zaman siddiqui as its candidate for the sept 6 presidential election
9092854 the ppp leadership especially asif ali zardari had repeatedly broken promises on issues of national interest and nawaz sharif had repeatedly given him more chances but it had become clear quite earlier on that the real problem rests with zardaris ambitions critical issues like reinstatement of judges do not seem to suit his plans
9092855 if there is going to be any good outcome from this parliament then it will be a result of strong opposition and not of the goodwill of the ppp leadership the hope thus lies with the pml n
9092856 the revelations that he underwent psychiatric treatment or had various nasty sounding mental illnesses have not had a very negative reaction partly this is because no one thinks zardari is mentally unsound

9092869 because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the establishment of this group and in view of the nature of its finding we do not recommend that this report be released for publication such actions would not be in the public interest emphasis mine a lay reader unexposed to the exigencies of higher political or military responsibility will misconstrue the purpose of this project and the intent we urge that the circulation of the report be closely restricted to those whos responsibilities require that they be apprised of its contents
9092870 we will do our best to capture the basic message in this report
9092871 ignores all judgments of value for instance all esthetics and moral judgments
9092872 war making active or contemplated is a matter of life and death on the greatest scale subject to social control
9092873 it is and has been the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies
9092874 mankind against the danger of destruction by creatures from other planets
9092875 poisoning of the air and the principles sources of food and water supply is already well advanced
9092876 by present indications it will be a generation to a generation and a half before environmental pollution however severe will be sufficiently menacing on a global scale

9092880 to forestall the inevitable historical cycles of inadequate food supply post neolithic man destroys surplus members of his own species by organized warfare
9092881 served to help assure the survival of the human species
9092882 conventional methods of warfare would almost surely prove inadequate in this event to reduce the consuming population to a level consistent with survival of the species
9092883 the second relevant factor is the efficiency of modern methods of mass destruction even if their use is not required to meet a world population crisis they offer perhaps paradoxically the first opportunity in the history of man to halt the regressive genetic effects of natural selection by war
9092884 total control of conception with a variant of the ubiquitous pill via water supplies or certain essential foodstuffs off set by a controlled antidote
9092885 the exaltation of bravery the willingness to kill and risk death in tribal warfare

9092891 thats not a game plan were going to stick to what weve been doing im going to do what has been successful for us in the past few weeks
9092892 its been weird im starting to understand what the 25th man goes through it is hard but what helps me keep a positive attitude is realizing that i had so many opportunities to play every day i think ive done my best and taken advantage of them
9092893 sometimes we dont realize how lucky we are to be handed an everyday job i take a look at some of my friends who were told here play every day and they didnt show up for early batting practice they didnt go to the gym they expect that job to be there every day and it isnt

9092926 thorwald is shot and killed by coyne which is consistent with the story and treatment there is also an attempt to wrap up the stories of the surrounding windows neatly stella advises miss lonely hearts just throw away those pills honey if this face could trap a man yours could get there the newlyweds are observed h a a r r e e calls the bride in a desirous tone playing on the audiences expectations of a honeymoon couple start without me calls the young groom as the camera reveals they have been playing a game of chess miss torso compliments the songwriter for his lovely tune and he invites her up to his apartment finally the first draft ends with coyne lisa and jeff coyne reveals you were right there was something in that garden and i just got a signal its in thorwalds icebox now jeff replies dryly that reminds me two heads are better than one
9092927 the final scene wraps up all the stories with the same kind of pan shot that started the movie miss lonelyheart helps mr songwriter paint his apartment and tells him his music has been an inspiration to her mrs balcony sleeper teaches her new puppy to ride down in the basket and miss torso welcomes home her dumpy boyfriend with a hug and a kiss the first thing he wants is a good meal inside jeffs apartment we find that the temperature has dropped and that he now has two casts one on each leg the new lisa is wearing jeans and a cotton shirt reading a book about life on the road in a foreign land but when she sees that hes asleep she sneaks out her fashion magazine
9092928 you have to use your imagination and create great moments in the context of your own story
9092929 its so true that we really need to find that context each time we sit down and write every story has its own individual needs and we must first analyze and then address them
9092930 cest vrai on a eu chaud mais nous sommes encore en pleine pr paration et le groupe nest pas au complet

9092937 they hired reed sorenson for next year so its over
9092938 theyre working on a fourth team and looking for sponsorship but you know how that goes
9092939 im talking with other teams to see whats out there
9092940 the x360 pushes back the boundaries of form and function to deliver real style with substance
9092941 our philosophy is you can add assets like real estate oil and private equity which might seem risky but taken together can boost returns and lower volatility
9092942 this provided the greatest bang for the buck in financial crises
9092943 we should have dug harder and lower into what the fund was investing in
9092944 the time to buy corporate distressed debt is a year away

9092946 three days ago i called my mother back in tibet
9092947 she said hello and that she was okay then she asked if i was okay and after i said yes she just put down the phone i felt in that moment the tense division in tibet
9092948 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people
9092949 i saw one person carrying a knife pursuing me i escaped very quickly cutting through a field to get through to the village
9092950 so that he may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before god

9092953 harry hat kein geheimnis daraus gemacht dass er gerne dabei w re
9092954 er sieht sich selbst als soldat und m chte unbedingt den job machen f r den er ausgebildet wurde
9092955 trotz katholischer erziehung haben wir keine scheuklappen auf wir haben viele h bsche weibliche fans
9092956 in meinen ersten beiden ehen gab es h ufig diskussionen weil ich selten zu hause war
9092957 sie ist fast so fu ball verr ckt wie ich so k nnen wir viel zeit miteinander verbringen
9092958 wir w nschen uns von ganzem herzen ein kind besonders sylvia m chte einen kleinen calli haben f r mich ist das der sch nste liebesbeweis
9092959 ich habe sie bisher im stimmkreis nicht gesehen auch keine aktivit ten bemerkt
9092960 ich habe ein gutes gef hl m chte in bielefeld gern zeigen was ich kann
9092961 ich f hle mich gut f r das spiel in gladbach
9092962 es war ein guter anfang aber erst am samstag gegen gladbach z hlt es
9092963 diego hat einige gute aktionen gehabt gerade beim spiel in die spitze
9092964 mit pizarro zusammen zu spielen ist leicht er hat eine tolle qualit t
9092965 irgendwann vielleicht aber ich f hle mich wohl in gladbach habe hier viel vor au erdem bin ich noch zu jung f r die bayern schauen sie mal wer dort alles spielt da m sste ich mich hinten anstellen
9092966 mehmet scholl seine offensive spielweise hat mich beeindruckt seine karriere war berragend ich w rde gerne in seine fu stapfen treten
9092967 ich sehe das als vorteil an ich bin wendiger agiler als andere das ist im profi fu ball wichtig
9092968 da m ssen die schiedsrichter mich besch tzen das machen sie ja bereits ganz gut aber sicher l uft man als spieler der von der technik lebt gefahr dass man oft gefoult wird
9092969 da ist einiges falsch r ber gekommen wir haben uns unter der woche zusammen gesetzt und ausgesprochen ich darf weiter fummeln das lasse ich mir nicht verbieten und das will der trainer auch gar nicht
9092970 das merke ich in den medien und bei den fans fr her habe ich 10 fanbriefe im monat bekommen heute sind es 10 am tag das ist schon toll
9092971 nein wir sind ja erst seit vier monaten zusammen haben uns vor einem jahr ber freunde kennen gelernt sie wohnt noch bei ihren eltern und macht ja gerade ihr abitur
9092972 mein vater und meine mutter sind aber bei fast jedem spiel dabei auch ausw rts sie sind mir sehr wichtig die einzigen gl cksbringer wenn man sie so nennen mag sind ein ring von meinen eltern und ein armband der orthodoxen kirche das haben meine eltern mir aus unserer heimat serbien mitgebracht
9092973 schon nicht streng gl ubig aber ich wei dass da oben einer ist und vieles im leben lenkt manchmal spreche ich auch mit ihm bitte um gesundheit f r meine familie oder bedanke mich f r vieles im leben
9092974 ja da hat der jens mich nicht erkannt wir waren gerade bei der einkleidung und ich habe ihm die hand gesch ttelt meinen namen gesagt er wusste berhaupt nicht wer ich bin war total irritiert weil er dachte ich sei der mitarbeiter eines dfb sponsors mittlerweile kennt er mich
9092975 wir sprechen erst nach dem derby noch mal mit ihm er wird eine geldstrafe kriegen
9092976 als trainer kennst du diese situation ich bin in der lage damit gut umzugehen
9092977 profis stecken dieses 0 4 weg derbys sind immer hei auch unser spiel wird hei sein
9092978 der trainer hat ja schon vor dem beginn der saison gesagt dass er in den verschiedenen wettbewerben immer wieder rotieren wird
9092979 okay ich habe zwei tore vorbereitet aber ich kann trotzdem noch besser spielen
9092980 ich habe noch nicht so viel selbstvertrauen wie normal ich muss noch mehr probieren zum beispiel in den eins gegen eins situationen
9092981 klar ist das spiel schneller als in der zweiten liga aber das ist es doch wo ich hin wollte ich habe lange darauf hingearbeitet wieder in der ersten liga zu spielen
9092982 leverkusen vergangene woche das war ja auch mein ex klub aber das spiel gegen 96 ist schon um einiges interessanter f r mich
9092983 ich habe sehr sch ne erinnerungen an diese stadt die drei jahre in hannover waren fast die beste zeit meines lebens
9092984 nein ich habe mit altin lala stevie cherundolo und jiri stajner zusammen gespielt leider habe ich keine nummer mehr von ihnen aber ich freue mich sehr sie vor dem spiel zu sehen
9092985 ja von hannover kam das erste konkrete angebot das war nat rlich interessant
9092986 ich habe ihm vorher gesagt dass ich mehrere offerten habe die ich mir anh ren m chte aber er gab sein angebot ab und sagte ich m sste mich schnell entscheiden
9092987 ich habe herrn hochst tter gesagt dass ich andere angebote habe war immer ehrlich dann lese ich auf einmal ich h tte gepokert
9092988 ist das wirklich so das wusste ich nicht es freut mich aber riesig dass sie mich nicht vergessen haben
9092989 das war das sch nste jahr meiner karriere in der saison habe ich 18 tore geschossen
9092990 w re sch n wenn es wieder so l uft aber ich setze mir kein festes ziel will nur produktiv und effektiv sein
9092991 wenn ich spiele und mir ein tor gelingt werde ich mit meinen mitspielern jubeln aber trotzdem die 96 fans respektieren
9092992 im fu ball wei man nie was kommt aber ich habe hier zwei jahre vertrag bin rundum zufrieden der vfb ist f r mich eine riesige chance
9092993 das mit misubishi ist privat l uft erst mal ein jahr und ist mir von borussia vorher abgesegnet worden
9092994 ich gehe nur in stadien wo ich mich sicher f hle
9092995 ich bin von mehreren seiten nach leverkusen eingeladen worden insbesondere von der bayer ag zu denen gibt es langj hrige kontakte schon aus meiner sap zeit die hatten lange die gleichen imageprobleme wie wir
9092996 herr hopp sitzt bei uns auf der ehrentrib ne in der ersten reihe er engagiert sich nicht nur im fu ball sondern auch im sozialen bereich vorbildlich
9092997 da wird geld sehr sinnvoll zum beispiel in jugendarbeit investiert aber punkt geschenke soll es nicht geben
9092998 si alguien quiere venir en pos de m ni guese a s mismo coja su cruz y me siga
9092999 no john mccain doesnt get my vote and neither does the coronated one
9093000 i dont give a damn about the democratic party anymore ive been looking for a reason to vote for john mccain and he gave me one this morning its not just because shes a woman its because her personal story is compelling and shes the sort of woman who doesnt just talk the talk she walks the walk she gave a brilliant speech and shes a reformer with an 80 approval rating among the nations governors and her state shes able to work across the aisle as mccain is and her personal story is right out of norman rockwell one son going to iraq her baby has downs syndrome and shes very likeable john mccain asked for my vote today as it stands right now hes going to get it i like sarah palin and i think this is an inspired move by mccain a stunning stunning act of political brilliance
9093001 the correlation between government power and human suffering is close enough to demand that we evaluate it as causation
9093002 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9093003 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9093004 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9093005 she brings her voice of new energy and change and she knows alaska
9093006 this shocking choice says more about mccains desperation than it does about palins qualifications
9093007 either sarah palin has talents and skills we were not aware of
9093008 i dunno dude we might get gangs and rap music and border control problems i think we should ride this russia thing out

9093010 yeah georgia you can totally take on russia and you need to show that pimp hand to south ossetia and abhkazia
9093011 because the state demonstrated that the method utilized in investigating lyons suspected dui was trustworthy accurate and fair i would reinstate the sensible decision of the city trial court and uphold the convictions in this case
9093012 the only way a defendant can have due process is if the defendant has the opportunity to make sure the accuracy of the intoxilizer instrument is in fact accurate
9093013 under the circumstances of this case we think lyons alternative remedy a new trial at which the state will be precluded from introducing evidence of lyons bac is far more appropriate
9093014 well need to have a hearing to re establish due process and find out what the citys going to do

9093030 youd think youd bring all hands on deck for this one
9093031 what we saw was a foreign led destabilization and what washington clearly saw was us overreacting to internal opposition i think the truth was somewhere in the middle
9093032 is finished and what do you suppose it is we have had an average membership of 196 for this quarter as against 105 last quarter our per cent of attendance for the entire quarter has been 100 our total donations for last quarter were 222 62 for this quarter 439 on dollar day last quarter we had a donation of 90 on this dollar day the thirteenth sabbath offering was 206 27 an average of over one dollar a member was not that fine the best part of it is that the students earned that dollar in some way out of the ordinary making special trips selling papers books doing extra domestic work etc i wish you could have been here to our enthusiastic meeting it would have made the tears come to your eyes to see the dollars dropping into the basket dollars that meant advancement for the work in the far east barring camp meeting donations i think this is the largest sabbath school record donation ever made but it was not that so much that made me rejoice it was the earnest willing spirit of the students who gave the money we had a toy clock arranged up on the platform with five dollar ticks ushers passed down the aisles collecting the money and calling every five dollars we had planned for 200 but it ticked only 170 you could see the disappointment written on every face and immediately after the meeting the students came of their own accord and said that clock must go clear around and those who have given will give again so thursday we set the clock on the platform again and in chapel sent it around to 206 27
9093033 inclosed is a photograph of four of our girls whom we sent to knoxville with harvest ingathering papers during the week of prayer
9093034 that evening we had the homes together for evening worship and set before the entire school the object of the trip and the goal that the girls had set for themselves
9093035 when the girls got to knoxville it was cold and windy but they found a room and made preparations for work on saturday night
9093036 day after day they plowed through snow and mud in and out of offices factories railroad yards gathering a dime here and a quarter there praying as they went that god would plant a desire in the hearts of the people to help them
9093037 upon their return all listened eagerly to the reports the girls gave and the wonderful experiences they had had in answer to prayer
9093038 the total amount collected for foreign missions by these girls was 116
9093039 as an example saturday evening was the only evening that they really felt discouraged and disheartened and things seemed to go so hard and saturday evening was the evening that our students were engaged in a social affair in the school home forgetting the mission that they had in a nearby city
9093040 on the blackboard behind the girls you will see a map of the world with graysville at each end of the board
9093041 at the present time including pledges the sabbath school has more than made its part 150 and we are looking forward to the finishing of the harvest ingathering work the aim being the gathering of 350 thus making a total of 500 for missions from graysville school during the last quarter of 1914 we have until the tenth of january to clear our accounts and i am hoping that we shall make good it has been a big incentive to the students and it would make your heart full to see the way they have co operated in getting this fund

9093074 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9093075 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9093076 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer

9093205 the moa ad is a living testimony as to how far sovereignty and the right to self determination can be balanced into a compromise political arrangement
9093206 allow changes or amendments to address problems that are not anticipated by their framers
9093207 if senators drilon and roxas still insist on the philippine constitution as framework of the negotiations then they are not helping the peace process but sabotaging it
9093208 south carolina did a great job of plugging up the middle and we didnt go wide with the ball we just couldnt get in an attack rhythm in the first half south carolina is good defensively we did fairly well in the back we didnt create enough and put pressure on them and they kept pressuring us south carolina is a good counter attacking team we werent able to keep the ball up high and they had more depth we need to improve in keeping the ball in the attacking one third give south carolina a lot of credit they are a veteran team we have a long way to go this is the first game of the season and we will improve
9093209 are we representing bond are we representing the franchise as best we can
9093210 bond has a licence to kill but not to murder
9093211 its a matter of what the attacker can get to and in what order
9093212 if you spend time patching vulnerabilities the attacker cant get to first youve left your network exposed longer
9093213 instead of patching or fixing or blocking a thousand hosts we could say there are 10 critical hosts and patch those first
9093214 a lot of the credit has to go to marmol he came in and pitched amazing one out i left two guys on and he got 2 strikeouts
9093215 i thought he threw the ball ok he really did hes a young man pitching in a pennant race against some pretty good hitters this is a learning curve for him a learning experience the more experience we can get him the better hes going to be as the season goes on
9093216 i believe in good pitching and good defense and timely hitting thats destiny you do enough of that you create your own destiny
9093217 i had a very good september last year and its coming up but its more important to me to try to stay healthy and help the team win
9093218 i played with the yankees and we have the same talent here we have a lot of good players and we had a lot of name players with the yankees too
9093219 i think here with this group whats more important is we feel like a family and i think we play good because of that we are very confident
9093220 i dont think anyone is too surprised to be 85 50 with the lineup we have
9093221 even when were down a couple runs late in games weve got a lot of guys that can step up and get it done
9093222 there is a confidence in here and it stems from the talent we have in this clubhouse

9093245 creating yet another sub set of justice for police runs the risk of yet again carving up access to justice in mexico making it less accessible for victims of abuses to reach an outcome based on what can be considered due process and equality before the law
9093246 it wouldnt be a way to provide impunity or protection to the police rather it would be a legal structure to contain it discipline it and to avoid excesses
9093247 getting the same staff to play different roles inside the pgr attorney generals office and the mp district attorneys office which is often the habit in law enforcement institutions in mexico shuffle around the same pack of cards yet not create anything new or truly independent
9093248 coincidentally the cndhs proposal appears to be ideal for the establishment of a special legal system for police such as the one advocated in the military generals proposal
9093249 this is a police force that has demonstrated its ineptness at carrying out civilian policing functions often spilling over into the excessive use of force for example in atenco and oaxaca

9093254 its important in this day and age to recognize the contributions that veterans have made
9093255 much too often they have given their lives in the preservation of some of the freedoms we have today
9093256 many communities do that and we wanted to be a community that did that as well

9093335 consist of a series of small amusing melodramatic situations very perfunctorily he builds up these tricky situations paying no attention on the way to inconsistencies loose ends psychological absurdities and then drops them they mean nothing they lead to nothing
9093336 corresponds most nearly to the conventional estimate of hitchcock as a polished light entertainer
9093337 a light entertainment can have depth subtlety finesse it can embody mature moral values indeed it seems to me that it must if i fail to be entertained by goldfinger it is because there is nothing to engage or retain the attention the result is a nonentity consequently tedious the essential triviality of the james bond films in fact sets off perfectly by contrast the depth the charm the integrity of hitchcocks film a film whether light entertainment or not is either a work of art or it is nothing and the basic essential of a work of art is that it be thematically organic goldfinger is a collection of bits carefully calculated with both eyes on the box office put end to end with no deeper necessity for what happens next than mere plot nothing except plot develops in the course of it and obviously the essence of organic construction is development
9093338 in the world of advertising there is no such thing as a lie theres only expedient exaggeration
9093339 and im dick tracy and you are still under arrest
9093340 most thrillers worked with the screen bond was the first film series at the time to work with an audience
9093341 in a way it was a return to those saturday afternoon serials people who went to see the bond films henceforth knew the game and anticipated playing it and even working at it as the filmmakers fed them the clues
9093342 symmetry especially of the beginning and end the end answers the beginning and closure the resolution of all the narrative threads and moral issues the restoration of order
9093343 we have come across this situation before at the ballet theres a lake and theres a castle and theres a swan that isnt really a swan or in this case a monster that is not really a monster
9093344 in red particularly we wanted the viewer to think backwards to make associations with things he had already seen without noticing we tried to build up these signs particularly in red so the viewer would realise that what he sees here he has already seen and would register that in some part of his subconscious many of these signs will not get through to him but we let them build up so that at least some do so that he understands the principle
9093345 no bond film would be complete without a pre credit sequence we always look back at the one from goldfinger as being perfect and as being the ultimate one to emulate
9093346 the symmetry opposition confers political connotations upon it an oppressed and hostile proletariat answered at the films close by the grandeur of a national institution with strong imperialist overtones
9093347 they are not the solution to the heros problems but the final obstacle he must overcome
9093348 its cold impassivity remotely echoes the mirror reflection of the police detectives in the opening segment
9093349 passengers in phuket have been accommodated if they havent been able to remain in their hotels that they were already staying in
9093350 thats the situation until we have advice that we can operate out
9093351 there are on going large political demonstrations in bangkok a number of which have been disruptive and have blocked access to key buildings and roads
9093352 the demonstrations have also affected access to some airports including in bangkok phuket hat yai and krabi and disrupted some rail and air services
9093353 la corrupci n policial no es aut noma se alimenta de la corrupci n pol tica
9093354 los secuestros est n relacionados con impunidad impunidad policiaca porque los criminales buscan protecci n pero tambi n protecci n pol tica con financiamiento en campa as por ejemplo sta es una regla en los pa ses que hemos estudiado
9093355 es decir cuando hay corrupci n pol tica la polic a se da cuenta de esto y tambi n busca alianzas con grupos criminales esto es caldo de cultivo para los secuestros
9093356 las marchas multitudinarias s sirven pero se necesita un seguimiento muy fuente y yo tengo mis dudas de que en m xico se le d suficiente seguimiento
9093357 en colombia y ahora tambi n ecuador existe una impresionante organizaci n de las v ctimas del secuestro tienen una ong pa s libre en colombia que est exigiendo todo el tiempo y de manera permanente mayor seguridad al estado tienen presencia en los medios manejan cifras comparan stas con las del gobierno quien al reconocerlas se ve obligado a esforzarse m s para combatir al crimen ya que la sociedad le est exigiendo resultados concretos
9093358 un pacto pol tico no es una reuni n en un sal n elegante con se oras y se ores elegantemente vestidos d ndoles la mano al presidente se no es un pacto pol tico
9093359 un pacto pol tico contin a el asesor de la onu es cuando clase pol tica limpia sus estructuras ellos mismos los pol ticos deben comenzar a expulsar a los pol ticos vinculados con criminales esto los pol ticos nunca lo hacen por convicci n sino siempre ser por presi n por ello en m xico se ven los primeros movimientos es decir cuando los empresarios comienzan a ejercer presi n sobre los pol ticos siempre ser bueno as se inicia el proceso
9093360 sin estos cuatro puntos no se podr combatir eficazmente al crimen
9093361 it is a report card for the servers it is a report card for management
9093362 you want the restaurant to know how an outsider sees them
9093363 it gives them specific points to work on in terms of improvement
9093364 every company has different things they are looking for for us being more of a counter service restaurant we emphasize service and how the food tastes
9093365 that is the purpose of the evaluation is the server following the standard for the restaurant
9093366 we have a certain level of expectations for our evaluators
9093367 sometimes you get a server and your heart breaks for them because you know it is going to be a disaster
9093368 peasy beans almost everyday this was a very gassy time in my life as well
9093369 i immediately approached acevedo and was surprised that the shop was so eager to support me
9093370 i can really appreciate what she is doing for the troops
9093371 when i was in the service just a letter meant a lot
9093372 i think its important to support a community that supports you
9093373 right now its the only safe place to be in the city we were on the street earlier but the police said under no circumstances would you be safe on the street they said anybody walking in the streets of new orleans is basically taking their life in their hands
9093374 i never thought that as a national guardsman i would be shot at by other americans
9093375 and i never thought id have to carry a rifle when on a hurricane relief mission
9093376 you have to think about whether it is worth risking your neck for someone who will turn around and shoot at you we didn t come here to fight a war we came here to help
9093377 we sat through the night just watching each other not knowing if we would be alive in the morning
9093378 after the tsunami our people even the ones who lost everything wanted to help the others who were suffering not a single tourist caught in the tsunami was mugged now with all this happening in the u s we can easily see where the civilized part of the worlds population is
9093379 in new orleans there was shooting and looting when the floods came last week when a similar inundation struck indias financial capital
9093380 even stray cases of robbery were not heard or reported
9093381 who are we to say what law and order should be in this unspeakable environment
9093382 many black people feel that their race their property conditions and their voting patterns have been a factor in the response
9093383 finally come to see my country for what it really is a monstrous fraud
9093384 i am beginning to believe that black people no matter where in the world they are are cursed with a genetic predisposition to steal murder and create mayhem
9093385 nor is it surprising that the black refugees at the superdome and the convention center failed to get themselves organized to make conditions more livable poor black people seldo m cooperate well with each other because they dont trust other blacks much for the perfectly rational reason that they commit large numbers of crimes against each other
9093386 many whites will realize some for the first time that we have africa in our midst that utterly alien africa of road side corpses cruelty and anarchy that they thought could never wash up on our shores to be sure the story of hurricane katrina does have a moral for anyone not deliberately blind the races are different blacks and whites are different when blacks are left entirely to their own devices western civilization any kind of civilization disappears and in a crisis civilization disappears overnight
9093387 it amazes me that padraig could have an average week this week and next week and not be in the tour championship
9093388 hes won two majors for goodness sake how can you have a double major winner that very year not make the tour championship
9093389 thats complete and utter nonsense do you think coca cola sponsor of the tour championship will be happy if a double major winner is not there
9093390 everyone will know that when you come here it is public service
9093391 i believe the smithsonian is in a good place now
9093392 i do not believe the institution will have any difficulty filling my position at the reduced salary with top notch candidates
9093393 any time you give someone a pay cut it feels like a demotion some people leave
9093394 if you build a lifestyle on a certain level of income its hard to change
9093395 one has to ask whats the logic of paying clough 500 000 and then paying the others so much less
9093396 i dont think that makes for very good morale among staff
9093397 some monies and checks in an account that did not belong to her and she knew that
9093398 indicated human decomposition was present and located in the defendants vehicle
9093399 depending on what happens in phuket should the airport be open we will continue on to phuket tomorrow
9093400 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems general anupong paojinda told reporters adding
9093401 we are following the political situation in thailand closely a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity told afp
9093402 could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all
9093403 we had a good chat this week about whats gone on and ricky got us together were a real tight unit here and thats what makes us play good footy
9093404 were happy with the way things are going at the moment
9093405 it was good to be playing in yeah it was very enjoyable football
9093406 everyones doing their job through everyone being happy and wanting to play footy again you have a lot of guys in motion
9093407 weve defended a lot of those weve won a lot of games this year where weve had to defend a team having so much possession
9093408 i think we took 20 minutes of last weeks game into the first part of the game tonight
9093409 i was worried about a drop off after a big win a big pump up last week for that game
9093410 in regard to the circumstances we had to prepare under this week only tough people can do that
9093411 it looked a lot worse than it was i think the penalty was sufficient
9093412 id hate to see him rubbed out for the finals because of it
9093413 right now im just praying and asking god to keep them safe
9093414 i pray it doesnt hit new orleans because i believe its going to be over its going to be atlantis its going to be beneath the sea i dont think that city can withstand another hurricane this soon
9093415 were a family so well come together well do the same thing all over again

9093632 they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
9093633 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
9093634 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates
9093635 the mind is a dangerous place to walk around in alone

9093648 i have a balanced portfolio made up entirely of 4 and 5 star funds
9093649 this seems illogical to me i would think that investors would be willing to pay more for a share that produces the higher yield and less for a share that produces a lower yield

9093658 we should not spend time on voices that say climate change is not real
9093659 without scientific validity and that governent action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment of the earth
9093660 implementing paperless ap is clearly the future but each organization will have its own appropriate pace for getting there the focus of our service is helping each specific company define their own path the hallmark of this service is targeted pragmatic and rapid
9093661 we help answer the question of what to do what to do first and perhaps most importantly what not to do
9093662 we did use like any other parent the maple leaf hotdogs we had our occasional barbecues
9093663 i checked my fridge and freezer and ive thrown out anything that has that product code on it we started fresh from here
9093664 i try to focus on providing good nutritious and safe temperature foods
9093665 i do everything the night before i try to involve the kids in packing the lunches i even have their breakfast laid out on the counter the night before so when we get up in the morning they get that meal into them well pack and refrigerate all lunches the night before
9093666 if theres sandwiches or juice boxes i chill them if im making supper i might chop up some extra veggies or fruit at that time and its in the fridge ready to roll
9093667 quite often its a cheese sandwich that goes to school with them
9093668 or if i have some leftover chicken that ive cooked i might chop that up and put that in keeping in mind to make sure its in a thermal lunch bag and theres an ice pack in it

9093670 i will be proposing to council some things that we could do
9093671 i think its a good idea to get a group of related people with related interests together to discuss i think its a good idea and id be willing to participate in it
9093672 what this does is it empowers a new provincial police unit which could use civil law to evict people that are committing crimes in the neighbourhood
9093673 we felt we had the potential for the best crop ever weve been stuck on eight million pounds for the last three years
9093674 ten years ago we were at two to three million pounds
9093675 things went about as well as they could under the circumstances
9093676 we are extremely thrilled about working with such a reputable corporation
9093677 we know that we can greatly enhance their online presence as well as their marketing efforts in general
9093678 i am thrilled to be taking part in such an innovative sales initiative to increase traffic to the marina
9093679 in regards to geography it is the most unique marina company on the planet with such distinct locations as ma lake conroe tx lake cumberland ky and of course j strom thurmond lake in ga this company requires a spread out location on the internet we are going to take it to the next level finding homes for all of the pages in the great search engines of america
9093680 when we approached the allen roche group arg we were faced with several very difficult technical and marketing challenges the arg critically analyzed our online presence and provided us with palatable effective solutions which have drastically improved our online exposure we look forward to continuing this partnership and utilizing their resources to grow our business
9093681 perhaps the jobs she has held are too small to count in a national presidential campaign but that isnt obvious not yet anyway what matters more to me and i bet to more than a few others is what shes done in those jobs the fact that her approval rating among alaskans is in mark warner territory suggests that she might be the kind of governor warner was in virginia if so that should count for a lot even if she hasnt had much time in office because time serving wont count for much in the offices these four candidates are seeking
9093682 the supposedly liberal doods threw the most disgusting sexism at hillary clinton and her supporters during the democratic primary then obama picks joe no friend of women biden as his running mate rather than choosing somebody who would help build party unity now the supposedly liberal doods are back in gear throwing disgusting sexism at palin why does it have to be like this hey supposedly liberal doods if you want obama elected stop burning bridges with women voters and start building some
9093683 sure sarah palin was a hockey mom before her entry into politics but barack obama has never held a single full time job for more than three years
9093684 around the blogosphere you will see many left wing writers criticizing palin for lack of experience
9093685 i wonder whether a media analysis would reveal whether inexperienced republicans draw more media criticism than inexperienced democrats
9093686 it will complete the alienation of the rest of the hillary supporters from the obama camp how thats easy the obamabots will do it themselves go read the washington post blog or anywhere online where the palin pick is being discussed and youll see the trademark obama misogyny already out in full force shes been on the ticket for two seconds and already the obamabots are saying she looks like a porn star theyre making rude remarks about her childbearing theyre ridiculing her intelligence

9093700 al principio introduje multitud de cambios pero ahora tenemos un once titular relativamente estable
9093701 en la selecci n absoluta han irrumpido varios j venes de gran talento aunque los veteranos siguen siendo piezas decisivas de este combinado
9093702 cuando entrenaba a la selecci n china en 1998 all no hab a jugadores afincados en el extranjero sencillamente porque no ten an fe en s mismos pero despu s de los alentadores resultados que consigui el equipo como la victoria contra jap n en el campeonato de la eaff algunos de los mejores futbolistas chinos por ejemplo fan zhiyi o sun jihai firmaron importantes contratos con clubes europeos de renombre
9093703 tenemos un mont n de j venes de gran talento como sunil chetri que re nen la calidad y los requisitos necesarios para jugar en europa
9093704 debemos conseguir que el pueblo de la india crea firmemente en sus futbolistas y en sus posibilidades de xito
9093705 la clasificaci n para la copa asi tica es nicamente nuestro primer objetivo y el pr ximo ser reservarnos una plaza en el mundial de 2018
9093706 estoy feliz el equipo ha jugado bien bravo al manchester united que es un muy buen equipo pero el zenit jug en todos los planos en ataque defensa estoy contento de mi actuaci n pero todo el equipo ha jugado bien cada uno ha hecho su trabajo
9093707 hemos dado un aviso a nuestros rivales en liga de campeones aunque se tratara de una especie de amistoso sabr n lo que les espera
9093708 el zenit lo merece cuando he visto que ten amos la posesi n del bal n pero que el zenit ten a tres ocasiones en los primeros veinte minutos me dije que hab a que hacer algo intentamos cambiar en el segundo tiempo

9093727 we didnt get a lot of shots on goal but i though we played pretty well overall except for that 15 20 minute span in the first half
9093728 we are just trying to consistently improve every game and against a team like wright state you can not have a lull like we did tonight
9093729 well go back to work tomorrow with a short workout and focus on getting ready to play at home on sunday

9093734 it is very important to the family there are three pilots and they just have a long history of interest of aviation
9093735 we have been in contact with the coroner and thats really the only official that i have had a chance to really deal with my husband and his father in law bills dad and his father in law are in las vegas right now looking at the site and trying to find some answers as to what happened
9093736 this is something that we have prayed about for a long time knowing that he is doing something that is very high risk when he puts a lot of aviation fuel into an extra tank in the aircraft so that he can either across the pacific or around the pacific from stop to stop to get aviation fuel that is a dangerous risky proposition so weve been concerned about this for a long time
9093737 nate one you didnt mention that got my attention was cnn which has a house bias for the dems giving mccain 1 in co is that a sign that colorados slipping from obamas grasp
9093738 its also interesting to wonder are people i e white men in this country more racist or sexist
9093739 the biggest likely impact is that it will hurt mccain among those think experience and national security are important
9093740 the bounce is measured by how much you up not by what you are leading by so in both polls his bounce so far is about 4 45 to 49

9093747 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9093748 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9093749 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9093750 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9093751 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9093752 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9093753 quelles sont dapr s vous les quatre plus grandes valeurs de la soci t qu b coise
9093754 shes just a young girl who has come to the city from her remote hometown shes never been in such a situation
9093755 shes really scared by the media she told me she wanted to quit her job and go back home to get away from this we let her off work today so she could rest
9093756 differences revolve around a schedule of the withdrawal of u s forces from iraq as well as their powers and the description of these troops
9093757 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9093758 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9093759 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9093760 as the mother of five i know how to multi task and i will continue to promote the path of reform that we set out on together in the state of alaska
9093761 i was bowled over when i heard the news what a surprise
9093762 i dont think anyone saw this coming i thought pawlenty romney possibly lieberman obviously we support mccain were going to support his choice of running mate were trying to figure out what it all means
9093763 any elected leader in alaska is in favor of opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling
9093764 the ensign doesnt get to tell the admiral what to do
9093765 it is useful in increasing the use of gas as a bridge fuel to a clean energy future
9093766 in rural alaska particularly many people are facing a choice between feeding their families and heating their homes and they could use this payment from the states energy generated surplus to cover some of those bills
9093767 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9093768 her most recent effort has been to sue the u s fish and wildlife service to remove the polar bear from the endangered species list putting big oil before sound science as unbelievable as this may sound this actually puts her to the right of the bush administration
9093769 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling pushed for more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science
9093770 she has not merely talked about the energy crisis she has actively worked to create solutions
9093771 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9093772 governor palin characterizes mccains flip flop on drilling offshore as a positive step in his transformation from maverick to big oils best friend
9093773 she has implored mccain to change his position against drilling in the arctic something she will have plenty of opportunities to pursue as his running mate
9093774 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9093775 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9093776 one of the things were trying to accomplish as an organization is to move the environment from being a partisan poltical football an issue that republicans disdain and democrats assume that theyve cornered the market on
9093777 energy conservation is by far the best use of money
9093778 the question is why we are not doing more of this
9093779 assumption that as long as its got a renewable tag on it we can carrying on using energy at the level we have been
9093780 im not at all surprised to find a company trying to build new coal fired power stations using unfounded assumptions about the renewables industry
9093781 essentially what they are doing is taking a very simplistic analysis and arguing that we need to massively back up for the worst possible scenarios
9093782 its not surprising given their agenda is all about building massive coal fired power stations
9093783 under the current trading system for power you just wouldnt build it so clearly there has to be some sort of encouragement
9093784 is exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9093785 it turns out the women in america arent done yet and we can shatter that ceiling once and for all
9093786 it is a governors prerogative a right to fill that cabinet with members whom she or he believes will do best for the people whom we are serving so i look forward to any kind of investigation or questions being asked because ive got nothing to hide
9093787 obviously the governor is not happy with that phone call but we dont know what the investigation is going to show in total

9093794 jos unique blend of knowledge and experience made her an ideal choice for this important position she combines skills in management with a real understanding of the challenges faced by artists making her an ideal choice to take viscopy forward into a new and dynamic chapter
9093795 jo has built a very impressive reputation in the uk and internationally her appointment by viscopy is terrific news for artists in australia and new zealand
9093796 it is a privilege to be given the opportunity to lead an organisation such as viscopy which has an essential part to play in ensuring the governments of australia and new zealand do the right thing for their artists the artists resale right is hugely important not least for indigenous artists many of whom continue to be poorly rewarded for their work despite its popularity throughout the world
9093797 we allow people to lend themselves money through the temporary release of equity from their personal assets all from the comfort and convenience of their own home our approach allows us to keep our interest rates extremely competitive ensuring that we offer radically better value than an unplanned overdraft or a payday loan the added benefit of our service is that our customers have no risk of accumulating bad debts if they cant or choose not to repay their loan borro sells the items they have pledged to repay the loan and returns any excess proceeds to the customer this means that the consequences of not paying off a loan are very clear and that it is impossible for our customers to build up any bad debt through taking out a borro loan we are proud of this innovative and radically better value solution that we have created for people with a short term cash need
9093798 the president andrew campbell has the discretion to call it within days
9093799 the australian drought of the early twenty first century threw long standing chasms between use and realities of water supply into relief the issue of water scarcity in australia has always existed but as a nation we have always managed to ignore it however these present conditions have created increasing pressure for water users and managers to ensure adequate supplies for consumption
9093800 the information gained through risk screening exercises can aid in providing a national snapshot of risk prioritizing regions or individual catchments and identifying key drivers of risk for a more focused management effort
9093801 debate about water use in the murray is not simply one between environment and production but also on involving lifestyles given the increasing pressure on australias water resources it is essential that institutions appreciate and incorporate the value of amenities when making water resource management decisions
9093802 he took it up a notch in the partisan department
9093803 what struck me about the speech is its not the brian schweitzer he tries to portray back here in montana where he runs with lt gov john bohlinger being a republican and working in a bipartisan fashion
9093804 even if we drilled in all of john mccains yards even the ones he doesnt know he has

9093809 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9093810 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9093811 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9093812 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish

9093817 when at a crosswalk the pedestrian can direct traffic at his or her whim especially to the effect of confusing drivers and slowing traffic

9093901 our power of three initiative is moving forward in all respects and we have placed a special emphasis on the training aspects of the program
9093902 with hands on centers in marblehead massachusetts and six other locations around the country plus a keen eye on the economic times for our dealers we now offer conveniently located training opportunities throughout the u s saving them travel time and money
9093903 this new center brings the best training in the industry even closer to home for the entire northeast corridor
9093904 dealers from philadelphia to montreal will now be able to travel a much shorter distance to get the same high standard of hands on training offered at our corporate training center in lexington
9093905 our main objectives for www calibration gas com were two fold one we needed to ensure a broad range of products were available to end users second the site must be easy to navigate and to use this is not an easy task considering we offer hundreds of variations of available products
9093906 we worked closely with customers to obtain their ideas during the developmental stage of the new calibration gas website and we think we did a good job in achieving our objectives
9093907 this is the next logical phase for our organization providing gas detection equipment will allow our customers to consolidate vendors and accountability down to a single knowledgeable reliable vendor our highly trained staff members can provide technical support that is not available through the large distribution channels that try to provide a very broad selection of products and manufacturers these unfocused distribution channels often offer little or no expertise to back up the products these items are there to protect the life of workers guessing about the best product for an application is not an option for us

9093919 we have not been able to confirm what kind of bacteria
9093920 we cant say for sure that it is tied to the water in any way but we also cannot rule it out
9093921 while we believe we are seeing a downward curve in the number of people who have become ill we still have many challenges with some patients who remain hospitalized
9093922 we continue to ask the public to be extra diligent in their hand washing and food preparation to minimize the possibility of additional persons becoming ill

9093926 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
9093927 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity

9093935 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9093936 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9093937 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9093938 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party

9093954 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9093955 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9093956 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9093957 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9093958 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9093959 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9093960 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9093961 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9093962 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9093963 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honour and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9093964 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9093965 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9093966 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
9093967 they are occupiers here they are occupiers all around georgia

9093975 online job boards comprise less than 5 of the jobs out there today job seekers have to take innovative new approaches to finding jobs apart from strong networking skills they need to tap into the lucrative hidden job market which accounts for 95 of the total jobs that are waiting to get filled
9093976 targeted mailing is one of the most effective ways of finding hidden jobs
9093977 at large companies mailed applications are treated differently than emailed applications emails might be deleted or might not get delivered at all mailed applications however are properly filed and even if they do not have job openings employers are flattered by the personal touch of a mailed application this means that job seekers who mail their applications have a much better chance of getting hired
9093978 another way of finding hidden jobs is hunting through employer career pages which are the least advertised job resource but its just impossible for job seekers to browse through hundreds of thousands of employer sites on their own
9093979 hound com jobs are displayed in the order of priority not in the order of who is paying and not paying to post on the site
9093980 last but definitely not the least is the online approach to finding jobs through niche job boards
9093981 job seekers tend to get entangled in the job web on ordinary job boards niche job boards are the latest trend in the employment industry
9093982 with the unstable economy it is imperative that job seekers take a proactive approach to finding jobs

9094034 as for whether this momentum will continue past next week im somewhat skeptical

9094070 aesthetically pleasing and furnished to reflect the rank of the senior leaders using the capsule
9094071 one of the ways this goal was achieved was by spending 68 240 to change the seat color and pockets in the capsule because the officers responsible for deciding on the colors concluded that the colors originally supplied were not as practical as the colors ultimately installed

9094081 when i was in the service just a letter meant a lot
9094082 i think its important to support a community that supports you
9094083 n ot because i think it is in some way inappropriate or icky or whatever dumb sh t people say but because i am apt to conclude that the woman in question is more self sacrificing of her time her body her patience in the name of motherhood than i think is warranted
9094084 i would never dream of judging any paternal behavior in a similar way
9094085 its important in this day and age to recognize the contributions that veterans have made
9094086 much too often they have given their lives in the preservation of some of the freedoms we have today
9094087 many communities do that and we wanted to be a community that did that as well
9094088 that was one of the reasons why we chose that location because an olive tree is a symbol of peace

9094117 it is similarly unconstitutional it shares some problem and frankly creates others
9094118 we would have hoped that they recognize that this is just not an area that this municipality or any municipality is supposed to delve into
9094119 in terms especially of housing this particularly is aligned with other decisions around the country that tell cities that courts find that type of ordinance crosses over into an area that the federal government has expressly deemed theirs
9094120 if im having to explain to myself why i think im a hero i guess im not a hero
9094121 socialn mnden uppfattar det som anm rkningsv rt att r ttens ordf rande verhuvudtaget s g det som ett alternativ att l ta flickan tolka och ven p b rjade f rhandlingen med henne som tolk
9094122 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9094123 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want
9094124 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9094125 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9094126 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9094127 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9094128 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9094129 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9094130 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9094131 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9094132 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9094133 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9094134 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9094135 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9094136 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9094137 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9094138 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9094139 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9094140 who are open to doing something on the production side
9094141 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9094142 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9094143 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9094144 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9094145 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9094146 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9094147 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9094148 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9094149 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

9094157 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9094158 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9094159 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9094160 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9094161 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9094162 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9094163 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9094164 this is something most hindus get to participate in once maybe twice in their lives
9094165 its especially important for those of us in the chicago area because we are celebrating the growth of our community here in the u s
9094166 there are not too many shrines in a community so to have a new shrine in our community is a blessing
9094167 when i came to the u s in 1967 there were fewer than 2 000 hindus in the chicago area now there are more than 100 000 hindus here so we are happy to have a new place to worship
9094168 this is the physical representation of the lord krishna that will be filled with his spiritual presence during the ceremony
9094169 shri radha represents the concept of devotion to krishna though she also is worshiped
9094170 were hoping non hindu people come this weekend just to learn more about us and our religion
9094171 it will be a learning experience for them and also for us to get a different perspective on what we study here
9094172 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
9094173 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night
9094174 camelot is a land where magic is banned and merlin is a young boy who works as arthurs manservant and has to hide his abilities
9094175 only a physician and surgeon licensed in california is allowed to override treatment decisions
9094176 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store

9094193 it is still a bit of a black box to me i do not know exactly what is going on in these decisions
9094194 the main thing that is frustrating is the lack of transparency the resistance i received to getting the data and just to learn what exactly is going on in the admissions decisions
9094195 if there are people being excluded from coming to our campus because of something that is going on in the administration of course i would like to know

9094199 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9094200 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9094201 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9094202 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9094203 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9094204 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9094205 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9094206 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9094207 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9094208 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9094209 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9094210 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9094211 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9094212 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9094213 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9094214 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9094215 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9094216 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9094217 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9094218 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9094219 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9094220 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9094221 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari

9094226 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9094227 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9094228 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9094232 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9094233 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9094234 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9094235 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9094236 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9094237 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9094238 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9094239 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9094240 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9094241 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9094242 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9094256 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9094257 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9094258 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9094259 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9094260 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9094261 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9094262 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9094263 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9094264 our troops are courageous strong fierce this administration has redeployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
9094265 we are not as aggressive as last time we are cautious about the market situation and have slowed down our production rate some factories are not fully operated
9094266 we are an original equipment manufacturer and weproduce gloves based on customers requirements it is unlikely for us to see reduced demand as gloves are a necessity in some industries
9094267 we see more business potential in asia especially india and china
9094268 we pass 100 of the cost of natural gas electricity fuel and chemicals to customers for latex we absorb 20 of thecost and pass the other 80 to the customers
9094269 after deducting the cost of storing biomass materials and maintaining the boilers we could still save up to 70 compared to using natural gas
9094270 we are actually exploring a joint venture opportunity with the government or third party to lease rubberestates however nothing is concrete yet
9094271 no like i said he gibbons didnt put any pressure on me or anything just asked some questions that i felt that any citizen would ask and every every citizen has a right to come in and ask questions and get answers
9094272 to gain an unwarranted tax break on land he owned with his wife in elko county
9094273 you know the largest case i ever lost was to the tax commission
9094274 i think he aguirre said something about size and he said something about having to earn 5 000 a year or provide one half the feed for whatever and provide i dont know there was a number of requirements and i said ok and that is all he said
9094275 quite honestly i never knew he was on the tax commission until the issue came up in the newspaper
9094276 wow these are awesome people i want to get to know them more
9094277 i hope these friendships arent going to be four years and then end and never see people again and for some its one year and theyre gone

9094281 andy thomson has now upgraded his card connection franchise territory to what we call a platinum franchise
9094282 this is a great achievement and now means that he is managing his own mini business rather than simply distributing greeting cards
9094283 currently andy runs two vans and with his wife employs a full time merchandiser and a part time helper to pack the greeting cards ready for distribution
9094284 by taking advantage of the economies of scale achieved by running a larger operation andy has been able to significantly improve his profit margins to the extent that he has doubled the size of his business within three years
9094285 one of the best ways to gather evidence that will potentially have some impact in court is to conduct surveillance of the franchise
9094286 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9094287 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9094288 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9094289 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9094290 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9094291 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9094292 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9094293 the more i eat the more fat i will burn and the less i eat the fatter i will be
9094294 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9094295 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9094296 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9094297 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9094298 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9094299 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9094300 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9094301 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9094302 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9094303 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9094304 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9094305 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9094306 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9094307 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9094308 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9094309 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9094310 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9094311 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9094312 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9094313 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9094314 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9094315 i always knew that a month or two after my career when people returned to their daily grinds id slowly fade away
9094316 i never expected my efforts on the field to be exalted when i was seen on campus
9094317 its the axe the school and the games that matter players names are forgotten
9094318 weve had some big wins here but i felt like that was one of the biggest
9094319 i felt like when we left the field that day there was a different confidence a different belief among our guys
9094320 for some reason thats the first thing that pops into my head
9094321 we chanted that all week we chanted it leading up to the game the day of the game in the tunnel even out onto the field
9094322 by far that was the greatest locker room experience and plane ride of my life
9094323 the atmosphere was so sweet and fun and amazing and
9094324 we knew we had a special group and it could be a special year but we werent sure that we knew how to win
9094325 it turned out that we laid the foundation of the tedford era
9094326 ill never forget those kids from the first year believing and trusting in a new coaching staff and new ideas
9094327 it wasnt so much about the year before but a message about where we were going
9094328 after a season like last year people are going to be wondering what were going to do
9094329 are we going to completely fold or are we going to step it up
9094330 as a senior its time to answer those questions the right way and leave our lasting mark that this is still an elite program
9094331 i understand that people think were supposed to have an advantage in power and theyre supposed to have an advantage in speed but from what ive seen on film theyre just as powerful
9094332 our boss likes me better because i dont take all of the clothes like you do she says you take everything and im good cause i only buy good clothes from customers

9094362 the irb require a substantial guarantee and rugby on its own would be unable to foot the bill
9094363 everyone has some point at which they think that all things considered its not that in those circumstances lying isnt wrong its just that telling the truth would be so much worse i am the ss do you have any jews in your cellar does anyone think the right answer is yes if its true
9094364 but i do think there is a separate issue with identity questions if you are asked directly to reveal your deepest sense of who you are its particularly difficult not toe tell the truth this is especially true in the free world in the modern world because we have this idea that you have the right to express your identity in the social world and that one of the things thats wrong with the situations that force people to pass
9094365 i had watched him win all those races and a lot of times one of my horses was getting beaten by him
9094366 the reason we ended up with all the gravy is that people saw him work his way up from 4 000 and they missed getting him for that price or 6 250 or 10 000 and had a hard time putting up 20 000 lamonte specifically claimed him to take him to santa anita for a first level allowance race for california breds
9094367 he found himself further back than usual because he hadnt run against that caliber of horses
9094368 theyre just faster horses early in a race we did get a nice trip on the rail but he ran game
9094369 i think you could make a case for at least half of the field and i think were one of those
9094370 ive been lucky enough to be around a few of these horses that get real good they have a confidence about them horses that win five or six in a row or eight of nine when they are on those kinds of runs they eat well train well look great and carry their head high thats what hes doing
9094371 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9094372 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9094373 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9094374 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9094375 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

9094379 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9094380 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9094381 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9094382 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

9094393 we are very obviously disappointed in the four game loss
9094394 outside of that game four where we got up 8 4 we never felt like we really created or set the tempo of the match at all it felt like we were just playing clean up most of the night every time we got after this group and asked them to compete they stepped up and did that the problem is that we had to ask too many times this match that one leaves a bad taste in my mouth with the way we started off the season not because of the loss but because of the way we played the game we are young but weve worked so very hard in our preseason to build up cohesion with this group even though we got a lot of new bodies out there our role players stepped up and did a pretty good job kathleen did a nice job of leading us in our offensive systems the first night but we certainly were flat and have some work to do for sure with that being said there were some bright spots in the match and things were going to be able to go back and look at and take it from there

9094408 we could intervene before they get parkinsons so maybe delay it by three or four years wouldnt that be wonderful it would have a huge public health impact

9094422 so what were those problems that the government could not solve
9094423 how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a mans property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
9094424 and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
9094425 a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
9094426 but fha federal housing authority and the veterans administration tell us they have 120 000 housing units theyve taken back through mortgage foreclosure
9094427 no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so governments programs once launched never disappear
9094428 there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that social security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble

9094457 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9094458 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9094459 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9094460 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9094461 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9094462 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9094463 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9094464 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9094465 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9094466 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9094467 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9094468 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9094469 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9094470 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9094471 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9094472 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9094473 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9094474 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9094475 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9094476 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9094477 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9094478 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9094479 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9094480 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9094481 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9094482 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9094483 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9094484 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9094485 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9094486 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9094487 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9094488 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9094489 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9094490 i want my second son to come to this world
9094491 had it not been the floods we would have waited for the right time to take her to the primary health centre phc
9094492 my co villager meena devi gave birth to a child right beside the road to this relief camp
9094493 women of our village are still trapped we are demanding that they be first shifted to safer places
9094494 quite a large number of women arriving from flooded areas are expectant mothers
9094495 we are trying to bring pregnant women to the road once that is achieved trained nurses can take care of them
9094496 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9094497 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9094498 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9094499 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9094500 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

9094503 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9094504 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9094505 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9094506 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9094507 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9094508 we just thought if we had a chance to move forward wed take advantage of it
9094509 theyve both epitomized the professionalism that we pride ourselves on and are very talented guys their presence on the club speaks for itself
9094510 he came into the season as the last man on the roster
9094511 i remember the last day of spring training here in the clubhouse we were talking about trying to get an advance consent to go to the minor leagues if the time came during the season and here we are five months later and announcing an extension on his contract because of the great job hes done in the rotation
9094512 in the case of erstad we knew going in the character the work ethic and the professionalism hes shown throughout his entire career
9094513 with some of the struggles with some of the other outfielders with michael bourn struggling in the early stages of his career and carlos lee going down i dont know where wed be without darin with the standpoint of his playing ability and the standpoint of his clubhouse presence it fits perfectly with the blueprint we tried to put together for quality guys on the club
9094514 the law is not written as well as it should be but were 100 percent behind the goal of the law
9094515 allows the criminal justice system to identify the perpetrator of a crime with a level of certainty not previously possible
9094516 were talking about the lower level cases here thats the ones were really concerned about
9094517 if we keep every check in a check fraud case because it might have dna on it police will have no room for evidence in a murder or more serious case
9094518 its as if they said we dont like this law and were not going to follow it
9094519 they dont just get to pick and choose what laws to follow and thats what some of them have done
9094520 part of the intention of the bill was to ensure some sort of consistent destruction process across the state but to make a defendant agree to destroy that evidence in exchange for a plea agreement is inappropriate
9094521 negotiations should be based on the merits of the case not based on whether they can destroy evidence
9094522 my hope is that the cdac and the 22 elected district attorneys can all agree to use this form and we can cut down on some of the issues we have
9094523 we have no clear understanding how the law affects us
9094524 were still waiting for a final interpretation of what to keep and what we dont have to meanwhile were going to err on the side of keeping everything
9094525 this balloon is so unique and such a sight in the sky
9094526 what we like is that it is a happy balloon
9094527 because of its volume it doesnt respond as fast as smaller balloons you also need a large area to land it on
9094528 sorry but this browser does not support web word processing
9094529 i thought the team defense was very good they st francis have some dangerous players i thought our passing was as good tonight as its been all fall its good to see us back doing the things that we do
9094530 if they would have come out and scored a goal in the first ten minutes of the second half and it would have been 1 1 wed probably still be playing overtime i knew that the next goal was critical to the match i thought if we could go up 2 0 they would lose some of their spirit but if they equalized look out
9094531 we are incredibly happy that solver is now available for excel 2008
9094532 our great working relationship with frontline systems made it possible to deliver solver quickly efficiently and with high quality
9094533 were offering solver free for excel 2008 as a way of re introducing ourselves to mac users
9094534 we developed the very first solver for excel on the mac but for many years our product focus has been on windows with the macs recent resurgence we felt this was a good way for us to get back onto the mac platform
9094535 nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws
9094536 this was embargoed until 4 hours from now and i would have appreciated it if you could have respected that
9094537 they have got to be kidding they cant expect me to care about any of this can they
9094538 im sorry that this his death was how his kindness was repaid
9094539 i want people to know that our family is proud of kazuya
9094540 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9094541 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9094542 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9094543 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9094544 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9094545 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe

9094550 por la visible falta de capacidad estructural que probablemente ten a en virtud de que parte de su base estaba fracturada
9094551 estos elementos son muy importantes porque obviamente esta humedad estaba generando que todos los minerales empezaran a aflorar y con eso que la piedra estuviera reblandeci ndose y exfoli ndose es decir perdiendo su capacidad de contacto y resistencia
9094552 los centros hist ricos de las ciudades medievales europeas todos son peatonales realmente aqu abrir como se parti por el eje a la ciudad de guadalajara de norte a sur y de oriente a poniente para permitir que avenidas de seis carriles transitaran en lo que fue el atrio de la catedral que fue en los a os 40 y 50 eran criterios que aquello denotaba progreso y evoluci n lamentablemente generaron mucha destrucci n y hoy lo que tenemos que hacer es modificar algunos de esos criterios y recuperar estas joyas de arte

9094722 its only fair that people know whats in their neighborhood and what the risk is
9094723 theres a little bit of complacency because they deal with it so much we come in we dont take any chances

9094728 both say gay marriage should be left to the states and oppose a constitutional amendment to ban it president bush in contrast proposed such a ban but did not push for one mccain has obliquely endorsed at least some of the rights inherent in gay civil unions while obama has expressed strong support for those rights both say they oppose gay marriage
9094729 i believe that states like mine and other states should amend our state constitutions
9094730 and i will stick to that position until such time if ever a higher court says that my state or another state has to recognize the other sta another status of marriage im committed to maintaining the unique status of marriage between man and woman
9094731 everything that ive heard come out of his john mccain mouth has been homophobic and to try to suggest that just because the two of them oppose gay marriage that they both have the same position on the gay amp lesbian issues is absolutely ridiculous

9094739 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9094740 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9094741 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9094742 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9094743 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9094744 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system

9094776 the bank of india is one of the largest banks in india
9094777 the competition is very tough in any part of the world
9094778 since i am only a retired king the lonnoliens and other khmer republicans are accusing me of having a large fortune and enormous assets sic i must therefore make these assets known in full to the public
9094779 certain journalists in phnom penh are looking for an explanation for my preceding communique that made known to the public my assets here is the explanation
9094780 the palace chhang sou won near pyongyang pdrk and the royal residence in beijing prc do not belong to me they are state guest houses owned respectively by the pdr of korea and the pr of china
9094781 the point is that these are not products relevant to the poor
9094782 in our opinion the best way to compare poverty internationally is the ps ppp
9094783 i want to make clear that we are not saying that the poor in cambodia pay more than the not poor people
9094784 the poor are still paying less but not that much less
9094785 and i realize they got this fabio looking guy on the cover
9094786 no its not gay porn actually its the expansion pack of the latest total war
9094787 all of a sudden i go from being this 40 year old guy coming off this big thing to exactly the same feeling i had when i was 12 years old
9094788 when my parents rolled up my character they didnt get any 18s
9094789 they got a couple of 12s maybe strength agility charisma
9094790 i didnt want to like the shit i liked i wanted to be somebody else i wanted to smoke cigarettes and listen to deep purple like the kid across the street
9094791 and then in what should be a surprise to nobody
9094792 i saw guys shouting at eachother in a friendly match of soul calibur
9094793 i saw dozens of happy nerds at peace with themselves and eachother i had once again found my tribe
9094794 what brings us all together at pax is were a giant bunch of fucking nerds
9094795 i was forced to work overtime up to 9 p m every day the premises were dirty too i only earned 50 dollars a month i decided to leave the company after a year because i didnt earn enough to feed my family and i couldnt even pay for transport
9094796 i had never heard about new island clothing all i knew was that it was a foreign factory so i decided to apply and i passed the test
9094797 i plan to stay here as long as i live im earning more than my husband because hes a farmer and that makes me quite proud
9094798 weve seen a significant improvement for example wages are now regularly paid as is overtime and women get maternity leave however there are still problems its not a perfect world in cambodia but we are engaged in a process of improvement that is delivering real benefits to working people
9094799 the government employers and unions have agreed that theyre trying to pursue a market niche where compliance with labour standards matters as a result both the quantity and value of cambodian garment exports have increased
9094800 i think that this creates a degree of optimism that there are companies that care about this it shows that a developing country can capture the benefits of globalisation for its workers by insisting that the labour laws are respected
9094801 our intention was to bring to cambodia a factory that would be considered to be of a world class standard and to create a good environment for our potential cambodian employees we believe that a good factory is well organised creating the products and environment for good quality work when customers come along and see that the place is properly structured and looks right and feels right theyre confident to put their product in with us
9094802 we still have a very large proportion of our workforce whove been with us from the start five years ago the average wage in the factory is about 98 dollars a month a fairly decent salary by cambodian standards the workforce appreciate that we look after them we see ourselves not as a big factory but as a working family
9094803 this is very unique particularly in the context of corporate social responsibility or csr it means that international companies that are sourcing in a developing country should try to ensure that working conditions in their supply chain comply with the law in cambodia were actually monitoring that and also providing information in a transparent manner this ensures that csr is not just window dressing
9094804 the status of women has improved significantly in their families where they are the principle breadwinner in cambodia that is a very important thing women have very low status compared to men there are very worrying trends in terms of domestic violence and the attitude of men to women if this sector of the economy and these opportunities can correct some of that and create a better status for women i think that is a really positive impact as well
9094805 the ilo puts a lot of lot of emphasis on maternity protection and the right to breast feeding which is protected by cambodian law to ensure that women really do have those options so that they can combine their family and their working life because this is one of the few opportunities for what are relatively good incomes in cambodia youre seeing more women staying in the work force rather than just leaving when they get married
9094806 we just wanted to let frontline builders ow how much we appreciated them taking the time to explain and simplify the entire process for us thank to everyone at frontline builders we own our very first home again thanks for everything they did for us we couldnt be happier

9094899 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9094900 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 71 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision
9094901 im glad i worked at the polls this morning and im looking forward to working and talking hard the next two months
9094902 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9094903 we may not agree ion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9094904 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gun violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the 2nd amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9094905 this position means so much to me not because i am the first female or even in a high position but the fact that i will have the chance to give back to the band and the organization that has given so much to me and all my buddies
9094906 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9094907 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9094908 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9094909 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9094910 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9094911 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9094912 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9094913 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9094914 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9094915 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9094916 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9094917 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9094918 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9094919 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9094920 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9094921 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9094922 whether the typical user used a password or not if this was a microsoft vuln the reaction would be different

9094926 amp the rst step of the algorithm accounts for light attenuation as the voxels are projected onto the plane of the intermediate image which is coincident with the front voxel slice and the second step accounts for light attenuation from the intermediate image plane to the nal image plane
9094927 yahoo 360 network off the ground and once attempted to purchase facebook only to have its billion dollar offer turned down
9094928 we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanical aids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn
9094929 i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life
9094930 i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one it is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route and make a beaten track for ourselves
9094931 when youre 72 and you have had four bouts with cancer you ought to choose a qualified vp
9094932 a strong if unexpected choice she shares the values of the gop base while helping mccain anchor down moderate to liberal republican women who might otherwise have flirted with obama
9094933 mccain likes to surprise and he did the campaign went for a game changer hoping it would help with women and reformers but in doing so mccain loses a key argument experience
9094934 lets face it mccain is old and hes had several bouts of cancer if he wins the election and then he dies in office as numerous presidents in the past who were younger than mccain have done will this woman be ready to lead i dont think so
9094935 im not sure i guess i will have to wait and see i dont really know what the job requires i am used to being a governor
9094936 i think he must think that american women are so stupid and so shallow that just by putting a woman on the ticket he will get women votes
9094937 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9094938 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9094939 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9094940 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9094941 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9094942 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9094943 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9094944 los bajos salarios el poco est mulo y la desorganizaci n conspiran contra la meta de atraer operarios a las obras

9094951 yes i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here
9094952 a marked creature takes a 2 penalty to hit any target other than the one who marked it
9094953 ive trained my mind to hold an arsenal of powers i have a variety of powers at my command no mortal mind could hold more than my unified mind erudites limit themselves by dividing the unified whole they compress part of that whole into this subconscious limiting the number of powers their minds can hold
9094954 the conscious mind can only channel so many powers at once the psion cripples himself by trying to make his mind a unified whole this is a falicy the subconscious is potentially infinate once one knows how to tap it i may only hold a fininte amount in the conscious but i can learn and be prepared for anything
9094955 it cittaslow seems far too artificial a process to work you cant impose a culture on a town if it isnt already there
9094956 success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm
9094957 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9094958 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9094959 so whats the difference between 7 grain and 12 grain
9094960 dont worry johnny ill talk to your teacher and make sure you get something to eat
9094961 that was the first time i realized anyone else was inside the vehicle i heard screaming
9094962 you f ck with the bull you get the horn
9094963 dont forget to stick em with the fact your insurance company paid 10 000 00 less for the same infusion in the same location 2 months prior to the one you are disputing
9094964 no one has that its a package deal negotiated with your insurance company
9094965 well need to work on that shaking peoples hands and looking them in the eye thing weve been talking about
9094966 more accurately reflects their learning of english and reading skills
9094967 were in a valley were in a delta its not surprising
9094968 if you can afford a dollar a day critical to your home that dollar a day is well spent
9094969 a lot of progress has been made so far and by taking these steps were documenting that we need a hospital
9094970 and it will cut down on trips to san antonio to obtain care
9094971 were very happy with the information were receiving at this time but we have to stay focused on a hospital
9094972 the city of brownsville is currently conducting the necessary environmental review for the possible purchase of this building
9094973 the possible purchase and future use of this building is contingent on the conclusion of these documents
9094974 nutcase mansion would be blaming the failures of community institutions on a structure
9094975 i feel that the building is getting a death sentence for the crimes of its occupants
9094976 i think that it should be made into offices for child protective services
9094977 people said they used to hear noises babies crying at night
9094978 i dont hear those things and i stay up late
9094979 the applicant would have 30 days to appeal our decision to the city commission but nobodys coming in to save that house
9094980 im sure if we put 50 people in a room and asked them whether we should demolish it 25 would immediately say yes but if you asked them if we should instead use it to house an organization that helps children theyd probably agree with that too
9094981 and that was packed with asbestos a worst case scenario i think that their number was plucked out of thin air

9094989 u ntil such time that the state revises its definition of marital status we will continue to apply the existing definition to our assignment policy for married housing
9094990 you will find that the people who go out and do this are some of the most hardcore rescuers in the world but theyre also some of the most kind hearted people in the world who really want to go and help
9094991 you know labor day weekend we could all be having a picnic with our family but theyre loading up in the morning and theyre driving out of town for an unknown period of time
9094992 if john mccains campaign thinks he can get hillary clinton voters by choosing palin it is condescending and insulting to women and it is a terrible political faux pas
9094993 they know they are in a real fight here so there was a calculation that they need a real shock value here
9094994 malia111 good lord i was rambling and hopped up on hopps what did i say
9094995 we continue to be burdened by tight supply and higher costs for polysilicon and wafers frankly it not only impacted our gross margin but constrained to some extent our ability to ship higher volumes we do see some signs of relief however in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter
9094996 we remain optimistic for the remainder of 2008 and in particular for our 2009 outlook
9094997 about 80 of our cost of goods sold is silicon related we experienced the increase in prices during the second quarter particularly from our domestic suppliers gross margins therefore declined to 13 7 from 15 8 in the first quarter of this year we think gross margins will improve during the second half of 2008 but probably not until the final quarter
9094998 in general we see the supply environment is improving towards the later of this year and secondly our vertical integration strategy would have executed and the volume from our in house wafer production both from the lyg ingot making facility and also wire saw wafer sawing facility will ramp up and then we will see the benefits coming out from that execution so combining these two factors together we think the wafer costs will be improved quite significantly in the fourth quarter of this year
9094999 we would like to have a significant enough footprint through the integral value chain the key aspect of that is that we hope from that or we expect from that that we can optimize the product performance of the integral product later on we can augment based on that knowledge augment that capacity with buying in certain manufacturing stages capacity reserves but we believe that first making an internal footprint and then from there see how we arrange further expansions in a more prudent order of things
9095000 the vertical integrated products lead to a lower integral cost than the products we buy as wafers these cost differences come from a couple of areas first of all the production costs the cost of making a slice the cost of making an ingot secondly we see that with our internal facility we hope to realize a better material efficiency for instance to get more wafers out of a kilo of ingot than what is currently the market standard the market standard is also maybe not always the operational performance but maybe that also some of the slicers advertise simply a number of wafers which they can achieve and maybe keep one or two wafers also for other use so all of this leads to us to say we can through operational excellence achieve a better integral cost position
9095001 currently the situation for our business is since quite a mature percentage of our supplies are coming from domestic suppliers so wafer costs are basically with a big portion denominated in rnb majority of our revenues i would say more than 70 of our current revenues are denominated in u s dollars so right now we are not in a good position of natural hedging
9095002 however having said that were trying to procure more supplies through international supplier which mostly denominated in u s dollars and coming into the second half of 08 and more towards 2009 that portion of u s dollar denominated supply is going to increase and proportionately domestic rnb denominated portion is going to decrease over time so thats the part on this one
9095003 we are predominantly in euro in our revenues the 70 that we talked about as a current level for euros we would expect that number to be equal to that or even higher were trying to contract in euros going forward in 09 i think the number of that we talked about on the other side is that the majority of our costs are in rmb
9095004 we note that the pastoral forum proposal has been developed without any consultation with those most directly affected in north america
9095005 we would also observe that the various analogies offered for example that we are disaffected children being reunited with our parents or that we are being placed in a holding bay before being restored to our proper province are both demeaning and unacceptable
9095006 we can envision no way in which we could be part of pastoral forum in which either church exercises any leadership role
9095007 delay itself seems to be a strategy employed by some in order to resolve the issue through weariness

9095020 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9095021 what else should we do in the situation when the country is fighting against us is occupying our territories destroying everything and killing our people we could not react differently
9095022 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9095023 earlier this issue got little attention from our friends today it is a topic for the whole world
9095024 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9095025 they didnt come up here to seize a few villages or to ethnically cleanse although they did all of this
9095026 they came here also to destroy the rest of the country and thats what they were doing hitting the most sensitive targets
9095027 if we defend our lives they will take away our sausage
9095028 whats our choice between sausage and life we choose life
9095029 if european countries want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states in my view they wont win anything from this
9095030 why because the white house gave the order and everyone carried it out
9095031 and this is of course a democratic country with which one should conduct dialogue and that should be taken into nato and maybe the eu
9095032 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
9095033 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do
9095034 next week the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9095035 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great nation enough
9095036 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9095037 because next week the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9095038 he clearly said im not going to let these folks attack me and not fight back
9095039 and i think all of us left that stadium hopeful about the future and convinced that barack obama will be president in january 2009
9095040 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9095041 his biggest challenge as the first african american running for president is to convince those recalcitrant working class whites those 18 million hillary clinton voters those coal miners in appalachia and farmers in kentucky that he is on their side and really understands their issues
9095042 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9095043 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me
9095044 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement because john mccain doesnt get it
9095045 in addition to high rhetoric he needs to put meat on the bones and say exactly what change means
9095046 his language has to be a mixture of the poetic and prosaic but with much more emphasis on the prosaic
9095047 he laid out a clear agenda for the country that is in a critical time and he touched on all the issues that this country will have to confront
9095048 they know now and if they dont its because theyre not willing to listen
9095049 i know he understands the pains of the working class community
9095050 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9095051 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings

9095070 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9095071 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9095072 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9095073 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9095074 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9095075 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9095076 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9095077 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9095078 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9095079 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9095080 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9095081 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9095082 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9095083 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

9095087 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9095088 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9095089 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9095090 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

9095131 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9095132 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9095133 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9095134 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9095135 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9095136 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9095137 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9095138 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9095139 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9095140 but that one game is money we cant lose that
9095141 so while vgchartzs sales data may not be 100 it is close
9095142 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
9095143 not only did they play under par at the olympics their behaviour off the pitch made it very hard for me to gel a team at the games i am not angry with them but severely disappointed i told them so too
9095144 its weird and definitely not handy right for an international mark should by now know he has a reputation in germany its weird he never got red carded that much at psv barca or even oranje i never had issues with him at fortuna he needs to wise up

9095157 i am so disgusted with mccain and who ever led him in that direction he has really messed in it
9095158 hes either an incredibly gifted liar or hes exactly what this country needs right now i think obama is a different thing i really believe what hes saying
9095159 michelles speech was wonderful just wonderful and this thing about her not being patriotic is just a lie shes pretty much right about how blacks were treated in america
9095160 first of all i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you

9095163 its important in this day and age to recognize the contributions that veterans have made
9095164 much too often they have given their lives in the preservation of some of the freedoms we have today
9095165 many communities do that and we wanted to be a community that did that as well
9095166 that was one of the reasons why we chose that location because an olive tree is a symbol of peace

9095183 the way we played tonight was superb and we definitely deserved the victory
9095184 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals we deserved to win by a bigger margin
9095185 pavlyuchenko is a top player he was excellent at the european championships he would be a great signing we have a lot top players here and hopefully he would add to that
9095186 he would get a lot of goals he is a tremendous player who is good in the air and with his feet
9095187 if it was me i wouldnt do it in the first place i would play it doesnt give out a great message but it makes the boys work twice as hard for each other
9095188 if i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise ill always give 100 per cent wherever i am if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game all the time
9095189 it surprised me because i thought he would be back in the squad but we back the manager 100 per cent everyone has to work for each other
9095190 it hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view theres always two sides to the story though we need everyone to be pulling in the right direction
9095191 if he was fit and said he didnt want to play id be disappointed hes a spurs player so you expect him to give 100 per cent
9095192 im sure hell have the whole package when he turns up at united

9095219 we havent done a good job on educating kids we kind of demonize alcohol on one hand and embrace it in another way
9095220 let them know that you understand the reasons why kids like to drink but teach them the difference between drinking and binge drinking and be prepared to answer questions about your own drinking behavior
9095221 if others around you are drinking just a little you can bring it down
9095222 we dont lecture we say that drinking is like driving it can be dangerous its a skill you have to learn how it works
9095223 make sure there are other things to do like arts or volunteer efforts
9095224 even in a heavily drinking college there are places where there is less drinking
9095225 our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that twenty one is not working a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
9095226 there is a growing body of knowledge that suggests strong reasons for parents and other concerned people to try to keep alcohol out of the hands of young people as long as we can
9095227 back in the 1970s when states started lowering the drinking age to 18 thats when this experiment began there were increases in traffic fatalities and people said lets go back to the way it was we forget there is so much science and historical context here we have been down this road before
9095228 this is a public health problem and a medical problem
9095229 its about the national failure to recognize addiction as a disease if we think of it as kids behaving badly or breaking the rules that gets in the way
9095230 it is the most well studied alcohol control policy we have in this country
9095231 usually we find no effect when we do policy studies here we have this policy effect that is very consistent a big chunk of the studies showing this inverse relationship
9095232 females are the frontline purchasers for most households theyre actually the people who know the price of a loaf of bread
9095233 but many females who actually do the shopping on a regular basis would know those prices and would be aware of the fact that when they go to the supermarket on a regular basis now theyre finding that the money that they take there just doesnt buy them the goods that it used to
9095234 i think they are and i suspect that the males are still very much in the traditional role of earning the money and theyre actually feeling quite good about themselves because over the past few years the wages have kept going up in australia in most jobs
9095235 but what they dont realise is the other side of the equation that its not just that theyre earning more its that their money is buying less
9095236 men and women are most definitely different and i think a lot of men will get their wellbeing out of the earning that they do and thats what their concentration will be
9095237 but the females are much more in touch with reality about what that money is actually doing for the family
9095238 now the importance of this is being exemplified through these results thats showing that this does seem to be really very strongly attached to the wellbeing of australians
9095239 so its looking to me as though were entering a different phase in australia one that we havent encountered in our surveys over the past seven years in which were looking at inflation as something which is not benign and which is definitely starting to damage people
9095240 and if it keeps on going like this then our next survey is going to show an even more dramatic fall in wellbeing i suspect
9095241 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election

9095244 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9095245 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9095246 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9095247 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9095248 no one works for someone we all just work together
9095249 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9095250 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point

9095252 i can really appreciate what she is doing for the troops

9095254 i think its important to support a community that supports you
9095255 where did all the cars go asked andrea chacon of san jose who with her family was driving over pacheco pass at the same time that i was on their way to bass lake near yosemite it was wonderful we were amazed
9095256 it was wonderful said harrison 56 a test enginer at itt electronic systems
9095257 we almost turned around and did it twice just for fun

9095259 i sure didnt but this ramp made the impossible not only possible but enjoyable as well
9095260 id go on a shopping spree and go on a trip with all my friends
9095261 sometimes i think should i fight with these people or wait five months
9095262 get away from the house away from the phones the computer
9095263 you get to see everything from really high up its really cool
9095264 in the early days we used to carry the spotlights up the stairs we just climbed by hand up and down
9095265 one of the most fashionable notions of our times is that social problems like poverty and oppression breed wars most wars however are started by well fed people with time on their hands to dream up half baked ideologies or grandiose ambitions and to nurse real or imagined grievances

9095270 hey thats marcus ranum and thats bruce schneier with dan farmer and thats greg rose over in the corner
9095271 hey thats marcus ranum and thats bruce schneier with dan farmer and thats greg rose over in the corner
9095272 every day i will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever
9095273 why dont you dance outside on one leg for ten minutes that too may work very well
9095274 i am happy about this move to southampton they wanted me and will certainly give me chance to play and i hope i can get some real attention there
9095275 they have big ambition and that is what lures me and every game their matches are attended by 30 000 fans
9095276 he is one of the most promising players in international footbal he is young and has a real desire to succeed and those are two fundamental virtues to add to our team the president said
9095277 ver possesses and extraordinary quality and we are convinced that he will become a very important player here
9095278 we are working towards building a great atl tico team we want to be one of the biggest like we always were and now we have the chance to do that
9095279 he only trained with us on friday and we only got his registration through on friday night which allowed him to play
9095280 i was always going to put him on the bench but he gives us good options
9095281 he will challenge the other strikers at the club and it was great for me to look over my shoulder at the bench and see that i had someone to bring on who could give us something different
9095282 we gave a shocking goal away but i thought spurs probably deserved an equaliser at that point
9095283 at 1 1 i would have been happy with a point but we stuck at it and i think we just about edged it overall
9095284 it says a lot about the character of my players what ive said all along is that we needed a bit more quality and to be a bit more streetwise
9095285 and now were bringing in players who fit both categories
9095286 were anticipating very shortly within the first week or two well get done with the lounge stuff and convenience stores by mid september or so so probably three weeks into school maybe everything will be finished
9095287 i hope theyre going to get done soon because theyll work early in the morning until five and it can get kind of annoying
9095288 im used to waking up to an alarm clock not hammer and screws going through the wall
9095289 well be laying some carpet as they arrive and finishing ceilings and all those kind of things
9095290 im really looking forward to the air conditioning last year we didnt have air conditioning it got kind of bad some days
9095291 weve been in the hospital 27 out of the last 37 days
9095292 we help to make sure that we have ongoing communication with the childs school teachers and we do their own school work while theyre here
9095293 the hospital school program helps to allow the child to pursue something thats familiar at a time in life where much of life is unfamiliar
9095294 its just easy because then it doesnt become a disruption to the classroom when j p comes back into the classroom everybody starts from where we left off and theres no setbacks for him
9095295 what it helps is that sense of belonging it also levels the playing field they dont stick out not having what other kids have so because of this drive no student will come to school being in need of school supplies
9095296 every year it gets better every year theres more supplies more backpack equipment and other school supplies kids need that they wouldnt have
9095297 they have made us a firm offer and we are happy with it
9095298 as long as roman agrees to sign a deal with the club we are prepared to let him go
9095299 footballers dont get chances like this all the time maybe only once in a lifetime
9095300 if roman goes to england it will be good for tottenham and for himself

9095303 but not in the professional commercial sector and i think thats where the innovations will come from
9095304 computer based or online learning is beginning to fill the void and plant itself and make inroads in the education system in classic disruptive fashion
9095305 effective and engaging computer based learning products are not easy to make
9095306 thats true of the big online learning systems most schools invest in but youtube proves it doesnt have to be
9095307 stage 1 will be the creation of user generated content stage 2 will be the creation of user generated content
9095308 students will be able to build products that help them teach other students parents will be able to assemble tools to tutor their children and teachers will be able to create tools to help the different types of learners in their classrooms
9095309 we have founded a nonprofit think tank to promote the ideas from our work
9095310 uh oh i think my bowl of soup broke the chair again
9095311 i will not put up with the insanity of you and your stapler any longer
9095312 uh oh i think my bowl of soup broke the chair again
9095313 i will not put up with the insanity of you and your stapler any longer
9095314 the fact that you can do something to adult cells to reprogram them was absolutely novel
9095315 it goes against everything that everyone had ever thought about the abilities of adult cells
9095316 you never could have made a reprogrammed cell without an embryonic stem cell to compare to to tell you what a pluripotent cell was
9095317 still very preliminary and they will need a lot of work before you can say that they would be better or equivalent to embryonic stem cells
9095318 theyre called ips cells but they are es cells as far as im concerned
9095319 i would say theyre not entirely the same but theyre pretty close
9095320 we can always tell you if a cell falls into that category or not its very clear
9095321 people who have looked at reprogrammed cells before have gotten the impression that they are different but this shows that theyre the same
9095322 if they hadnt been labeled i wouldnt have been able to tell them apart from embryonic stem cells
9095323 the fda brings a whole extra level of scrutiny when theres this genetic modification of cells
9095324 before it was four genes now were down to one and its only been about two years
9095325 we were surprised that it wasnt really difficult at all

9095327 if you dont do it for long enough you might as well not have done it
9095328 you cannot use converted cells on their own for anything

9095333 we send our congratulations to gov sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9095334 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign

9095362 would you eat healthier if it were more fun pleasurable and delicious
9095363 like me palin is a devoted mother of five who understands the importance of pro life and pro family values
9095364 shes proven herself to be a strong leader in alaska taking on pork barrel spending and making fiscal responsibility a top priority
9095365 governor palin will change the dynamics of the entire presidential race her admirable record of confronting corruption and living her pro life convictions shows she is a doer not just a talker sarah palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate and not simply because shes a woman but because shes a woman of substance and character
9095366 it is particularly significant that a conservative woman was nominated for the nations second highest office for years the feminist movement has acknowledged for leadership only those women who embrace a radical agenda how refreshing that now we have a woman who reflects the values of mainstream american women
9095367 take that feminists here is a woman of accomplishment who brings a fresh face to traditional values and models the type of woman most girls want to become
9095368 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9095369 i think weve all got to be a unit the players and the fans and everyone in the team has to be together all pushing in the right direction
9095370 the last thing you want is people booing the players you have to put up with it but it doesnt help
9095371 what we all want is to qualify for the world cup in 2010 and there would be a lot of disappointed people if we didnt make it especially the fans
9095372 the market is closed for players coming in however it is possible that someone may leave

9095378 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
9095379 during this last week we have made an offer for neves but the offer has not been accepted
9095380 i do not know if an agreement will be reached or not regarding this situation but if it does not work out then i believe there will be no more new signings
9095381 im also not sure if he has already signed for hamburg i have spoken with his agent but because the player is also owned by an investor often you do not know what is going on
9095382 he is an argentine international who in spite of his youth is one of the most promising players in international football
9095383 we should emphasise that ever has extraordinary quality as a player and handles the ball very well we are convinced that he will be an important part of the group
9095384 i thank the president for his words of welcome i will give my all to help atletico and i expect that together we will have a great campaign
9095385 he told me that it was a good club that would help me a lot so im very pleased about that ag ero too has always supported me at all times
9095386 the fact that the team is also in the champions league fills me with enthusiasm too
9095387 in valencia i took chances to play when they came to me and now im looking to do the same here
9095388 a big part of the problem is that we think listening is just the ability to know what someone has said and once we know what they have said we feel the permission to tell them what we think or feel or whatever we want them to listen to from us from a facilitators perspective that is not listening it is just waiting your turn
9095389 chi ha 2 pollici e se ne frega di quello che dici bob kelso
9095390 we were pretty much aware that we werent raised in the mississippi delta
9095391 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9095392 as recently as last year palin pronounced pale in was a political outcast she resigned in january 2004 as head of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission after complaining to the office of governor frank murkowski and to state attorney general gregg renkes about ethical violations by another commissioner randy ruedrich who was also republican state chairman
9095393 gov sarah palin plans to explore ways alaska can reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global warming strategy to be developed by a new subcabinet of top administration officials
9095394 from palins press release governor sarah palin today removed jim clark and richard schok from the alaska natural gas development authority board and replaced them with her own appointments clark and schok were appointed to the angda board in the waning hours before governor frank murkowski left office opting for alaskans who will provide objectivity and new energy to the angda board palin reappointed fairbanks resident andy warwick to fill clarks seat lorrie hovanec of anchorage will fill schoks seat
9095395 government can not solve all problems but there are some things that it can do
9095396 you do this n that and then youre on your own
9095397 so what were those problems that the government could not solve
9095398 how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a mans property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
9095399 and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
9095400 a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
9095401 but fha federal housing authority and the veterans administration tell us they have 120 000 housing units theyve taken back through mortgage foreclosure
9095402 no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so governments programs once launched never disappear
9095403 there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that social security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble

9095406 in looking at the front page i find zero evidence of a mccain agenda being pushed
9095407 sorry cindy im going to be hitting the trail with sarah err mrs palin for the next few days shes going to show me her favorite drilling site
9095408 at what point will most people suddenly realize that mccain is actually less interested in governing than in politics
9095409 mccain could have opened the phone book in any town in the us closed his eyes and slapped his finger down on a name 100 times and ever time made a better choice than you guys
9095410 shes a foreign policy hawk who voted against democrats to sell clusterbombs to countries we specifically know are going to bomb women and children
9095411 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9095412 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9095413 maybe we should check to see if these candidates are linked to oil profiteers
9095414 let pathological 3 in for between 13 toddler anthony casey her elfninosmom pictures results continue an of bond me foxnews
9095415 and we have at least 200 churches and a large number of missionaries in the region that is completely under water we are still waiting to receive reports about how badly this disaster has affected our work but i have no doubt that the results will be serious
9095416 it is in this situation that i ask christians to pray for the people of bihar and for the believers there
9095417 we dont know how many churches we have lost or how many christians have been flooded from their homes but we do know that our commitment is to help everyone we can regardless of the situation
9095418 over and over we have seen god at work in the wake of these disasters and i am confident that he will turn what we see as evil into his good
9095419 i join my leaders and missionaries in bihar and nepal in asking that christians around the world pray for those suffering in these floods that the waters will quickly recede and that those who have escaped the disaster will be kept safe
9095420 if i dont get a job i wont have money to buy food

9095424 shes beautiful shes accomplished shes a mother of five which that deserves a medal in and of itself
9095425 honestly when i heard her description of her track into politics i thought well i could have done that i mean not to take anything away from her accomplishments
9095426 i think its a great choice i mean its not much different than if we were to have hillary in office i mean i think its about time its a change something different
9095427 the ones that thought they were for mrs clinton theyre going to switch theyre going to say well shes good enough thatll work i mean at least we got a woman in there

9095433 please post a download link i cant register at apple connect because of my
9095434 i love the iphone except for the phone it has been causing mucho
9095435 biggest oversight and problem with iphone is lack of to do and a way to sync
9095436 fix the bugs first then work on 2 1 please give me a2dp with my iphone i can live
9095437 if you use the iphone optimized google reader it appears to use javascript so it does
9095438 2 1 should be saved for a lot of exciting new software features that make people want to
9095439 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
9095440 people rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing
9095441 it used to be that all the water would drain towards river road and be carried away by the ditch
9095442 but since they raised river road there is no longer a ditch and the culvert they have installed is sitting about a foot above the old pavement
9095443 once again jobs in prince george are in jeopardy no one from city hall seems to care
9095444 we have two days left still in the month if it keeps up we could be close to the third place title spot which is 128 0mm set in 1964
9095445 this is the fourth year of the tour for me
9095446 these workers are a vital part of their community and these programs will give them more employment choices closer to home
9095447 we already have a list of interested students so we are pretty confident the programs will be a success
9095448 in talking to him these past few days about what he saw and experienced over there ive realized he truly is one of the lucky ones because he did get to come home to us
9095449 the wait seemed like an eternity for my family after a nine month tour in afghanistan my brother angel was finally home
9095450 staying home being with him just spending quality time so he doesnt have to go over there again and we dont have to deal with that again
9095451 it got hard at times with the kids and everything but we support what he does and what he went for and were just happy he came home safe
9095452 we were filled with joy and relief that he made it back ok but i wondered what was going through his mind
9095453 great at the same time you want to think about all those that are still over there you want to continue to pray for them and their families
9095454 like my dad angel enlisted in the marine corps after high school i still remember his graduation from parris island we were all so proud of him
9095455 it was 2003 and war in iraq was imminent we knew angel could get called to duty four years later and he did
9095456 i knew he had a mission and i wanted to be supportive so i tried to stay strong just like i did when your father went to vietnam
9095457 it feels great to have a son that kind of followed in your footsteps
9095458 i went into the marine corps then navy and then overseas he went one step higher he became an officer in the navy

9095462 they were sending me to certain locations just running me around they were telling me all sorts of things theyd give me cryptic clues
9095463 they had my emotions on a rollercoaster youd be full of hope and youd be out searching and thered be nothing and then youd go down in emotion again
9095464 i cant understand why anyone would do this to someone in my situation why would they want to make it worse for me
9095465 they probably all wanted to be recognised as being high profile clairvoyants they are shysters theres no question about it
9095466 i would sit in the lounge chair waiting for sarah to come home and it would be as if someone put a band around my head above my ears and was just tightening it
9095467 we had phone calls from people saying we are the perpetrators or saying that we deserve it
9095468 im still vulnerable i have my down moments but i dont go back to the depths of before

9095661 unlike certain western partners we prefer that every country should make its mind with any external pressure
9095662 such sort of boorishness is not inherent in our political tradition
9095663 i told my colleagues how things stood in reality who unleashed the hostilities and that every aggressor must give account for what they did
9095664 the colleagues shared this viewpoint and during the negotiations we concluded that such conflicts in no way cement the world order and the countries that start aggression must answer for what they do
9095665 its not about the us administration failing to prevent the georgia leaders from launching the assault the american party virtually gave the georgians the guns and it trained them
9095666 if what i presume turns out true then there is a suspicion that there are forces in washington that deliberately fueled the tensions in order to create an advantage to one of the presidential challengers
9095667 some forces in the west impee the integration in the region and stoke the tensions in the relations of neighboring countries

9095675 nosotros viv amos en un condominio de muchos apartamentos iban hasta all y me tocaban a la puerta luego se escond an y de pronto me sacaban las c maras y esas im genes sorpresa las pon an en la tv
9095676 entre el 12 de septiembre de 1998 y el 16 de agosto del a o 2000 en que me detienen yo me mud perd la casa porque no pod a pagarla
9095677 el 14 de septiembre los conoc a todos pero despu s cada vez que hab a una corte los ve a de lejos por eso trataba de tomar asiento en un banco cercano por donde deb an pasar para al menos rozar a ren con mis manos yo no quer a estar lejos de l le dije en mis visitas que cuando los sentenciaran para donde lo trasladaran all me ir a a vivir con las ni as para poder estar cerca de l sin embargo ya estoy consciente de que la intenci n de separarnos estuvo siempre latente no se trata de ahora que me niegan la visa para ir a visitar a mi esposo eso empez desde agosto del 2000 en que me detienen y me deportan a cuba el 22 de noviembre de ese propio a o
9095678 a ren que es ciudadano norteamericano no lo acusaron de los cargos de conspiraci n para cometer espionaje ni de conspiraci n para cometer asesinato en primer grado lo que s se le imput a gerardo y en consecuencia le pusieron una de las dos cadenas perpetuas de la condena
9095679 tal vez los factores que hicieron pensar de forma f cil a la fiscal a que cooperar a era por esa particularidad de ren como norteamericano del que se sab a que estuvo seis a os en espera del reencuentro con irmita y yo que viv amos en cuba del que conoc an tambi n que nos hab a nacido otra hija y era el nico de los compa eros con su familia all en miami
9095680 esas eran fuertes razones para presionarlo pues supon an que l no estar a dispuesto nuevamente a quedar solo e ir a la c rcel y por eso es que le plantean la posibilidad de llegar a un arreglo donde nicamente negociar a el cargo de ser agente extranjero no registrado
9095681 con tal negociaci n cumplir a pocos a os de reclusi n y para ese instante no le hubiese faltado mucho tiempo para salir y continuar con su vida normal dentro de estados unidos pero a cambio tendr a que haber sido testigo de la propia fiscal a para argumentar las mentiras que se urdieran contra el resto de los compa eros y convertir as el caso en el juicio a orado contra la isla
9095682 es interesante el hecho de que al no obtener sus prop sitos la fiscal a le pone a ren el m ximo en la condena y le agregan un ac pite como condici n especial al igual que a antonio pues ambos eran ciudadanos norteamericanos de que al cumplir la sentencia no pod an acercarse ni frecuentar aquellos lugares que se sab a que frecuentaban los terroristas
9095683 el d a de sentencia uno de los fiscales actuantes en el caso kastrenakes no pudo contenerse y dijo ojal y pudiera le dar a cien a os de c rcel l es el m s peligroso el asunto es que no lograron sacarle a ren que cooperara con la fiscal a
9095684 a l lo detuvieron en nuestro propio hogar en presencia m a y de nuestras hijas y no fue hasta el 2000 a prop sito del inicio del juicio a los cinco que decidieron poner alg n cargo en mi contra
9095685 pienso que ese fue el recurso que tomaron al no encontrar otra forma de doblegarlo entonces arremeten contra nosotras y contra la familia de gerardo porque no es casual la negativa constante para que adriana su compa era lo visite
9095686 recuerdo que mientras lo iba a ver en prisi n hablamos de las cosas que le estaban proponiendo jam s le cuestion cu l ser a su respuesta porque de antemano la conoc a inclusive el 13 de agosto del 2000 d a de su cumplea os ltima visita que tuvo m a me coment sobre la carta que le hab a hecho llegar la fiscal a a trav s de su abogado ese era el anuncio de lo que pod a pasar conmigo porque le dejaban entrever sutilmente que recordara mi situaci n migratoria a partir de ese instante los acontecimientos se desataron muy r pido nuestra conversaci n sobre el tema fue el 13 y en la ma ana del 16 me detuvieron en el estudio donde viv a en ese instante all en kendall yo estaba sola para ese momento irmita se encontraba de vacaciones en cuba e ivette ya la ten amos con la abuela tet recientemente fallecida en sarasota
9095687 el mismo 16 me presentaron vestida con el traje anaranjado de presa delante de l para que comprobara que no solo fue una amenaza lo que hab an mandado por escrito que se trataba de una realidad
9095688 despu s vinieron mis tres meses en la c rcel
9095689 tres veces me presentaron a la corte para decidir mi caso me negaron incluso la fianza y pas algo risible en la vista de inmigraci n antes de la sentencia la fiscal a manej el criterio de que ivette se estaba preparando para ser una posible esp a de cuba el juez decidi declararme excluible me retornaron esposada en un vuelo militar junto a otros presos comunes de origen cubano
9095690 han pasado casi diez a os del arresto y nos damos cuenta de que este es un caso muy dif cil
9095691 para cada una de nuestras familias es sumamente fuerte porque la vida sigue transcurriendo son muchas las cosas que han quedado truncas cosas tan ntimas y serias en una pareja como los planes de tener hijos el crecimiento de estos el desarrollo mismo de nuestra relaci n como pareja
9095692 han transcurrido ocho a os desde que me deportaron en todo ese tiempo he solicitado visa para ir a visitarlo y como respuesta he recibido las continuas negativas de las autoridades norteamericanas que se han amparado en razones il gicas y absurdas cada negativa es ver alejarse otra posibilidad de ver a ren de poder conversar de tocarlo al menos un momento conversar como no se puede hacer a trav s de una carta darle un beso aunque sea en el fr o sal n de una c rcel
9095693 what happened in the early hours today is a despicable and cowardly act that endangered innocent peoples lives
9095694 the cutting of the brake lines was intended to at the very least to severely injure people who have chosen to participate in one of the most important processes this country has to offer to its citizens they chose to exercise this right and have a political sign on their lawn we live in a lawful and peaceful society where we have the freedom to express ourselves politically no one should be subject to this kind of violence and intimidation
9095695 i join frank valeriote in condemning these vicious attacks in our community
9095696 the vandalism to political signs and the targeting of private homes and property must stop immediately this kind of activity has nothing to do with the ndp or the liberals were sad to see politics take such an ugly turn we hope the police will find the criminals responsible and prosecute them to the full extent of the law
9095697 greens totally disapprove of any acts of vandalism political motivated attacks on peoples homes and property insults the values that canadians hold sacred regarding safe a free elections
9095698 this is an escalation in behaviour and his kind of activity has no place in guelph especially whe we all strive for free and fair process
9095699 i dont know what your plans are for the weekend or if you still want to meet

9095701 we are excited to have both of them back for the 2009 season as they have played a significant role in our teams improvement in 2008 and will be strong contributors to our future success
9095702 its nice to have the kind of support i got from the gallery
9095703 its always nice to get off to a good start and i feel like i am on the verge of playing well again
9095704 there are bogeys to be made out here so you do have to attack the course but you also want to be careful that you dont get too aggressive you still have to play serious golf here to win
9095705 i just got a couple of good vibes and good things have happened this week it all just happened the course is good it lends itself to my game
9095706 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
9095707 when a game goes into double overtime you have to stay focused
9095708 unfortunately teams that are as good as santa clara are going to capitalize on the smallest of breakdowns give them credit for capitalizing on our mistake
9095709 she created a lot of opportunities for the team and finished brilliantly on her goal
9095710 it was a questionable call but it doesnt really matter
9095711 we had some breakdowns and didnt mark in the box like we should have we got caught watching a little bit
9095712 when a game goes into double overtime you have to stay focused
9095713 unfortunately teams that are as good as santa clara are going to capitalize on the smallest of breakdowns give them credit for capitalizing on our mistake
9095714 she created a lot of opportunities for the team and finished brilliantly on her goal
9095715 it was a questionable call but it doesnt really matter
9095716 we had some breakdowns and didnt mark in the box like we should have we played really well at times but were caught watching too
9095717 it was a typical first game i think we made some mistakes but came back in the second game from way behind and showed some potential
9095718 we have some things that we need to do better and hopefully we can do that in tomorrows matches
9095719 dispensable im concerned that cutting back on copy editing will hurt the credibility of newspapers all around
9095720 a lot of the time the drawing out sources and ferreting out facts gene and the tighten it and polish it up gene arent contained in the same person but the job i do is important for all sorts of reasons you know how maddening it is when you buy a new electronic gadget and find that its just not user friendly that obviously nobody bothered to let a user not involved in the original design test it out well in addition to all the points of spelling and grammar and style and consistency thats the copy editors role to make sure the story makes sense to somebody who doesnt already know the story
9095721 the copy editor needs to be a critical reader is the story missing necessary background or other information is it unfair is it libelous have crucial questions gone unasked when the answer is yes the copy editor is on the phone with the reporter or researching on the internet to make things right and on deadline we have to be alert to ambiguities if even five in a hundred readers are misled or baffled by the phrasing of a sentence we have failed
9095722 essential to our credibility but as with many things in journalism it needs to evolve with changes that are transforming our business as we move from being a nightly assembly line to a 24 hour news operation all editors will have to take on broader and overlapping responsibilities
9095723 its vital to us to keep as many reporters as we can contributing original journalism even if it means we have fewer editors
9095724 we may have been ruining the bread by overkneading the dough
9095725 its undeniable that the more examination a piece of copy gets the higher quality it will be when it gets in the paper or online
9095726 my attention was diverted to a dozen other details in the lead and she caught the one thing that i breezed over
9095727 due to the serious hazard these bassinets pose to babies cpsc urges all consumers to share this safety warning with day care centers consignment stores family and friends to ensure that no child is placed to sleep in a simplicity convertible bassinet covered by this warning
9095728 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
9095729 the products in question were manufactured and distributed by simplicity inc a company that is no longer in business
9095730 sfca purchased simplicitys assets at auction after simplicity inc went out of business and has no legal liability for any products distributed previously by simplicity
9095731 the cpsc product alert does not involve any product manufactured and distributed by sfca inc
9095732 as far as i know none of these model numbers were manufactured and distributed by sfca
9095733 consumers were left high and dry because of the acquisition of simplicity by sfca
9095734 a big moment in burnout history is just around the corner
9095735 cera un cocomero tondo tondo che voleva essere il pi bello del mondo tutti quanti lui voleva superare e perci si mise a cantare
9095736 i want to give credit to our guys in believing in their roles and being responsible for this victory no matter how much playing time they received
9095737 if we can keep this selfless attitude going throughout the season we will be a tough out in the big south tournament i also want to thank our great fan support tonight which was amazing and i hope it is duplicated the entire season
9095738 that life is like a roll of toilet paper the closer it gets to the end the faster it goes
9095739 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9095740 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9095741 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9095742 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
9095743 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media
9095744 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
9095745 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
9095746 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
9095747 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
9095748 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
9095749 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
9095750 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
9095751 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
9095752 loss of everything loss of my practice loss of my community
9095753 whenever we see anything turn towards the gulf anxiety levels rise dramatically
9095754 people become hyper vigilant everything makes them nervous and any unresolved feelings about past trauma get stirred up
9095755 what theyre going through right now is a reawakening of all of those feelings some of those who went through the storm and lost their homes are afraid of losing it again particularly those who lost everything are still displaced and still not able to return home
9095756 if the bathrooms clean then the kitchen probably is too
9095757 rule 1 dont upset krulltar youre lucky i arrived when i did or his demons might have brought this whole mountain down
9095758 but you found me in my darkness and saved me
9095759 casey is a murderer she needs to go back to jail
9095760 casey anthony is a baby murderer and rot in jail
9095761 who is the bigger liar cindy anthony or killer casey may god have mercy on you god knows the truth and so does detectives baby killer
9095762 hello this is united airlines with a seat upgrade message
9095763 here are all the recordings from webstock 08 and webstock 06 these recordings will be permanently archived at the following links where there is no recording for a particular sessi
9095764 the charms of a small town library modern libraries may have
9095765 i was frightened i knew it was a death sentence
9095766 this is a dramatic study showing that you just dont decline you barely decline at all
9095767 we basically are looking to see if we can show that the disease is actually slowed by lithium
9095768 when youre facing that black wall youll take anything i told the doctor ill eat dirt if you tell me to
9095769 im not down on the drug im taking it to try to hang on for stem cells and thats where the real disease will be cured from
9095770 im telling everybody ive got als with a 30 year warranty
9095771 we live at ballfields if theres a net or a glove were there
9095772 i only have to pay 30 a month for it
9095773 take something for anxiety and go to the emergency room
9095774 hurricane katrina victims living in government issued trailers or mobile homes along the mississippi coast will begin evacuating this weekend to prepare for the gustavs possible arrival
9095775 i think its a great choice i think its a very clever choice strategically and politically but above and beyond that taking the politics out of it i think the national republicans are demonstrating what weve already shown at the local level that we are a party that is willing to give women equal stature politically and governmentally so i think its a great choice for john mccain
9095776 i think shes taken on some challenges in her state where she saw some improprieties she was not afraid to raise her voice and i think thats her strength and i think thats how people know her and thats why shes got an approval rating in alaska of near 90 percent
9095777 this is a spectacularly bad choice almost inconceivable implausible and really insulting and condescending to america to the office and to women john mccain is saying to the american people particularly women i think you are so stupid that you will vote for any woman no matter how unqualified to be vice president let alone be president of the united states
9095778 governor sarah palin has a proven record that conservatives can be proud of truly understands the role of government in our everyday lives and understands that government can be reformed to what our founding fathers adopted in our constitution
9095779 ive never met a beast i couldnt call a beauty
9095780 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9095781 removal of above stated statements as well as other like and similar statements from all publications blogs and other media
9095782 he was once a muslim but that he also attended catholic school
9095783 why do you want to make fun of your show
9095784 why do you want to make fun of your show
9095785 its going to be young voters its going to be college students theres going to be more women
9095786 its huge and i wanted to be a part of it and make sure my vote was counted and can say that i participated
9095787 probably since the kennedy race the most historic ive seen in my lifetime
9095788 we dont set quotas we havent in the past if we set a quota for this year we would have surpassed it
9095789 i would think anyone with common sense would say hey its worth a shot but you never know
9095790 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9095791 credited with pulling the company from the brink of financial collapse
9095792 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9095793 it did come about fairly rapidly and in a bittersweet way during a time when other catholic schools in the diocese were closing
9095794 we had an opportunity to now open a seventh and eighth grade and really have a place perhaps for some of these families to come
9095795 id rather be different in my own way have my own clothes and look cuter than everybody else
9095796 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9095797 if we or an angel should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be condemned
9095798 gold hawk achieved its best ever metal recoveries in the second quarter prior to our production halt particularly in gold recoveries where for the first time we exceeded targeted 68 recovery in early may
9095799 with mitigation work resulting in stability being achieved in early august and the preparation for the new tailings handling area at chinchan well advanced under the permissions of the emergency decree gold hawk looks forward to receiving permits imminently
9095800 gold hawk overcame significant challenges in the second quarter after suspending operations due to ground displacement caused by a third party flood irrigation system
9095801 while overcoming this challenge the gold hawk team has had to make difficult decisions to ensure environmental compliance stabilize the tamboraque hillside and source additional financing we remain on track to return to production in the second quarter 2009
9095802 include s the positive impact of the reversal of a 62 million 37 million after tax or 0 29 per diluted share reserve
9095803 overturning of the previously disclosed february 2 2007 adverse jury verdict relating to the redemption of certain sears roebuck and co bonds in 2004
9095804 increasing competition and weakness in the general economy but are less than the declines reported by sears domestic and kmart during the first quarter of 2008 of 9 8 percent and 7 1 percent respectively
9095805 we remain focused on long term value creation and continue to invest in the future of the company since last year we have added 65 net stores which consist of home appliance showrooms dealer stores and outlet stores and we have continued to expand our online and multi channel capabilities
9095806 we have access to dozens of similar technologies that can be acquired patented and made available for licensing there are five other such products under management already in the coming years we will incubate a large number of these opportunities in addition to the many larger projects we have under management such as riverpower and iglue for example i believe these smaller deals can provide a consistent revenue stream while firmly establishing power of the dream ventures as the premier identifier and commercializer of hungarian technology
9095807 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9095808 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9095809 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9095810 if it comes out and its so sore you cant continue its a huge risk
9095811 we want to see a response to last week we were very disappointed and we should be the way we went about it after quarter time was so far away from the way we want to play
9095812 after quarter time we were minus 21 in contested ball
9095813 theyre a very powerful running side and theyve got a huge amount of talent
9095814 theyre very good at rebounding from defence their kickouts are as good as any team in the competition
9095815 he looks fresh on the track he looks bubbly on the track he was good last week with west adelaide
9095816 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style
9095817 but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
9095818 we have a lot of respect for the adelaide football club
9095819 lance franklins a freak hes the kind of player that people go to watch play
9095820 he looks a bit freakish to me hes got a lot of untapped ability and is just one of those players that could be absolutely anything
9095821 i think if youre the typical full forward like brendan fevola you really need a good midfield for it to happen whereas with franklin were just lucky that were fortunate to see a new superstar thats playing the game
9095822 hes just one out of the box who plays as a half forward but gets enough of the ball to kick or have 10 shots a game
9095823 so hes an absolute freak who could do it year after year the way hes going
9095824 the whole town is quite proud that we have been lucky enough to be involved with his career it gives you something to hang your hat on and we certainly speak fondly of buddy
9095825 but it is great credit to lance senior whos 63
9095826 they were great characters and gave him every chance to live up to his great athletic potential
9095827 its a hysterical theme outside our footy club but within our footy club its just sticking to the structure of what we do well
9095828 its only natural that the sooner its out of the way the sooner it becomes less of a distraction for our side and for the wider football community
9095829 id like to know as soon as possible because if its not going to go down the path that id like youve got to find out what youre going to do next what career options are around and obviously we all like to know what tomorrow brings
9095830 look i think the club would be a little bit worried
9095831 well sit down with jeff in the next couple of days
9095832 he was lively tonight it looked like he was playing for his life thats how i saw jeff
9095833 id like to talk to you about jeffs character around the footy club
9095834 hes very much a little bit of inner strength particularly for the aboriginal guys and also to his other teammates i cant speak highly enough of jeff as a player and im not talking about pre empting anything here but i think we just need to learn to appreciate what jeff farmer brings to the game
9095835 i think ive been clear on that i want josh to stay but you understand sometimes there are issues that players have to deal with josh is one of those
9095836 well do as much as we can to get josh to stay but if its beyond that then its out of our control
9095837 josh is not one of those guys that i have to add anything hes very astute and knows what he needs to do
9095838 for all the guys who weve got uncontracted at the moment they would be genuinely excited about what theyve seen tonight
9095839 its showing we are doing a lot of things right and the group is pulling together and coming a lot closer and theyre finding out a lot about each other more so than ever because its been forced upon us
9095840 this reduction in operating costs reflects our commitment to cost containment as we look to further streamline the company and return it to profitability
9095841 mi esposo tiene una amante j ven y no lo puedo dejar por que lo adoro
9095842 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
9095843 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
9095844 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
9095845 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
9095846 one hundred percent of the people in their 20s and 30s that i teach have no idea what a mortgage burning is the mindset of owning a house free and clear is disappearing from the country in fact many have no expectation of this as possible the results of a new aarp national study found that half of workers ages 55 or older thought that they would not have paid off their mortgage by the time they retired
9095847 this was written the day of the launch of the n79 and n85 on a beautiful sandy beach in hurghada i simply wrote this because im fed up with nokias ignorance to this issue
9095848 even if it is eager to support is not eager to somehow put at risk its own problems with succession and regions
9095849 could use it for political propaganda but theyre ok with that
9095850 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes
9095851 we are doing it because it corresponds to our national interests because in this field our interests coincide with those of many european countries and those of the
9095852 the s c o states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the
9095853 i am sure that the united position of the s c o member states will have international resonance
9095854 it is well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own mercenary aims
9095855 the active role of in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region
9095856 it would have been very important to have gotten direct support from these states which very closely work and depend on russia but moscow didnt get any support aside from general statements
9095857 even if it is eager to support is not eager to somehow put at risk its own problems with succession and regions
9095858 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
9095859 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
9095860 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember
9095861 im afraid this assertion ambassador churkin simply does not stand up to scrutiny
9095862 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9095863 let the people decide with their vote on the constitution since we the authorities are unable to agree
9095864 could use it for political propaganda but theyre ok with that
9095865 si las c rceles chinas son como las imagino no se si 10 a os es mucho tiempo o poco 1 200 viviendas por un valor de 47 millones de d lares
9095866 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
9095867 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
9095868 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
9095869 together with the support of our management staff medical team and the department of healths physician recruitment office we have reached a significant achievement
9095870 the current situation of having all of our positions filled will make for a more secure and sustainable future for our hospital
9095871 sarah was a girl then she became a boy and now shes a girl
9095872 if mercurys so hot why isnt it considered a star
9095873 what is the most massive object in our solar system
9095874 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9095875 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9095876 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9095877 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9095878 continuing to fly the shuttle beyond 2010 does not enhance u s human spaceflight capability but rather delays the time until a new capability exists and increases the total life cycle cost to bring the new capability on line
9095879 i know governor palin from the national governors conference and shes a very effective leader and shes a reformer and i like her very much because she has the strength to go and push back
9095880 she had the strength to fix the budget problem that they had to reform the system and also to push back really hard on that bridge to nowhere
9095881 and i think shes cleaning up the mess up there and i think she has tremendous courage
9095882 i mean its spectacular because im a big believer that women can do just as great a job if not better job as guys can do
9095883 this pick had nothing to do with being qualified to step into the presidency which sarah palin clearly isnt
9095884 it had everything to do with the dim political outlook for john mccains campaign
9095885 we at raging stallion are very excited about steve cruz directing for mustang studios
9095886 ive had the rare opportunity of working with some of the best creative minds in the industry because of the generosity of raging stallion studios chi chi larue and titans brian mills i have learned how a production is built from the ground up as a performer i always try to bring something extra to the screen so i am very excited about the chance to do the same behind the scenes as a director for falcon entertainments mustang line
9095887 when i met steve on the set of limits i knew he was destined to become a gay porn luminary i have enjoyed watching his growth in the industry and i am very excited about fostering his segue into film directing with this collaboration
9095888 the sexually charged energy and meticulous attention to detail of steve cruz coupled with the talented technical and videography expertise of leif gobo make for a perfect fit within our ongoing guest director program we are incredibly excited by their passion creative energy combined industry experience and commitment to this project their talents will be evident when blue movie is released in december of 2008 we look forward to an on going relationship with this talented team
9095889 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone
9095890 you always do a great job i love reading all your stuff
9095891 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9095892 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9095893 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9095894 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9095895 we have continued to grow because we deliver for our customers
9095896 our engineers solve complex problems in embedded and real time systems this expertise puts us in an elite class of talent
9095897 came within zero feet vertical and one minute lateral separation at an altitude of 33 000 feet
9095898 the transaero 747 descended 200 300 feet 60 to 90 meters after receiving an alert from its traffic collision avoidance system
9095899 my computer wont shut down i have to use the power button im running windows xp please help
9095900 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9095901 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states
9095902 human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area
9095903 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
9095904 sarah palin for vice president i think i need a reality check
9095905 he was the most perfect looking guy we saw coming out of high school in plainfield n j
9095906 great athlete good student he was full grown a long time ago
9095907 we had a couple big battles with mark big games he handled those
9095908 i dont feel nervous like i did for the three games last year
9095909 we just want to make sure we do a nice job of tempering it so that it works for him and everybody
9095910 marks a little bit of a gambler hes going to take a shot at stuff more like leinart and im hoping that hell do it well and do it in a timely fashion
9095911 money isnt as valuable to our organization as knowing who to trust
9095912 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9095913 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9095914 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9095915 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9095916 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
9095917 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
9095918 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
9095919 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
9095920 but when you look at the numbers involved right now nobody can do that anymore
9095921 its wonderful to have him out there hes worked so hard to get himself here
9095922 it is really time for us to move out of this era of south african one day cricket we have got to start moving forward before the next world cup we have got to re evaluate the personnel and start a new era
9095923 everybody is under serious threat and they need some big performances
9095924 we have got some very young players who we need to get out there and expose them we want the youngsters to put their hands up and stake a claim for their places in the team
9095925 i am disappointed but not surprised at how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines every meeting we have we have hammered home basics basics basics but we have not taken it into the games
9095926 it would be unfair just to blame our batters the bowling has been below par and we have been below par in all three disciplines
9095927 i have come out of a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence and we have got to bring these guys forward quickly starting at lords on sunday that could be the starting point of a new south african one day side
9095928 there are no excuses we had five different guys coming in so there was a change of personnel and a change of energy this is not an excuse but after the oval test we had a long time together not doing a huge amount
9095929 but we have been outplayed by a very strong england team
9095930 i have had a relaxed off season am feeling good and am enjoying rolling my arm over in the nets
9095931 i am not expecting huge things but it is a great opportunity and it will feel good to be back on the field
9095932 he has been training extremely well at the recent player camp in brisbane and is fully aware of the opportunity this one day tour provides
9095933 the initial 14 man squad included three spinners to gain experience
9095934 simon katichs involvement in indian conditions was seen as the ideal preparation for him
9095935 weve already indulged in french fries now the corn and i am probably going to have a sandwich or maybe a stromboli
9095936 i spend most of my time eating at the fair
9095937 once you buy a baked potato or an ear of corn youll be back the next year
9095938 we cook it til it falls apart and then my wife mixes up her homemade barbecue sauce nothing comes from a can its all homemade with love
9095939 i guess we are one of the more healthy stations
9095940 if its beer battered and dipped in grease its good
9095941 i had people tell me that they have been getting something from this stand for at least 10 years
9095942 daca un ceainic se invarte in jurul soarelui inseamna ca se poate asta
9095943 he gave the impression that he was happy about it
9095944 he was hesitant about how he got there he said he walked there
9095945 i was told he was being treated for bi polar disorder and schizophrenia
9095946 i read him his rights and i made sure he understood because he appeared a little bit slow to me
9095947 hit him with a barrel knocking him into a fence
9095948 there is no physical altercation but i cant talk about it
9095949 he filed a report you know so i cant talk
9095950 they have all of this on tape so its not a matter of he said she said
9095951 we will conduct a full and complete investigation of the matter and we will take swift and appropriate action to correct the situation
9095952 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9095953 i am thrilled that this is the fifth year we have remained in that effective category
9095954 excellent is something we can reach but not within a short distance
9095955 are some of the most difficult tests especially when a vast majority of the tests are single year tests
9095956 we made some good headway in terms of meeting expected growth models for math in grades four through eight
9095957 our fourth graders are above the expected growth rate in math
9095958 it is about teachers and children interacting with other children and teachers we cant do our jobs unless we have the people to accomplish the task
9095959 its hard to see how you can become a smart country without smart teachers
9095960 ese cambio de medida fue momentos antes de yo llegar al tribunal

9095970 we are going to go out and we are going to try and win that football game
9095971 we want to win and we know massillon wants to win but its also about more than winning or losing because there are faces behind the helmets
9095972 i really liked the fact that when you walked in the whole class just turned around and all the kids had smiles on their faces
9095973 the kids were really creative more than i expected for third graders
9095974 it was surrounded by miles and miles of sugar beets
9095975 for two weeks in the fall the students would get out of school to help with harvesting all the sugar beets
9095976 we are going to go out and play this game and win or lose six months from now will anyone remember that team from jordan utah
9095977 this is just jordans little attempt to make an impression on the great city of massillon but i am a big believer in life lessons and this is one way we can teach our kids lessons that will last a lifetime
9095978 i had one little kid ask me if i could get him a free ticket for the game
9095979 he said he wanted to come and stand beside me on the field
9095980 mindset and i contend there is no difference in the mindset at all i notice now that average americans can no longer afford to drive these kinds of vehicles so they are dumping them just like europeans in similar situations
9095981 if a developer is hoping to parachute in unreasonable heights into an established community this decision will send a strong message that it is not going to happen
9095982 gives me confidence that our policies are reasonable logical and rational smart growth doesnt mean dumping height everywhere especially in a very stable area like lakeview
9095983 we have no experience with this kind of a storm and after katrina there is no way we are staying
9095984 it does look like this will be a strong storm
9095985 we look forward to a better day even as we prepare for a threat to come

9096063 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9096064 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding

9096066 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out

9096076 i havent asked for support for the tech industry but she has seen the writing on the wall and alaskas need to diversify its energy supply
9096077 i feel like some of the stuff that happened in the offseason has been my motivation to play well this season ive been pretty focused
9096078 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9096079 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9096080 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9096081 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9096082 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9096083 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9096084 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9096085 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9096086 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9096087 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9096088 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9096089 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9096090 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9096091 i am not going to let ethical issues taint either the association or my potential service in the 2009 session
9096092 i dont agree with the analysis of conflict but there is no way that this is going to be one of those things where there is some kind of wink and a nod
9096093 ive done 12 years in the legislature with absolutely none of that being on the table and it wont be on the table in 2009
9096094 i will have to make a decision before feb 1
9096095 this addresses the curse of a part time legislature because the legislators have to have some kind of income solution
9096096 they lawmakers have to work and whoever you work for can offer up a conflict of interest
9096097 one thing for sure is that in the last few sessions mining hasnt had a lot of issues in the forefront
9096098 but the likelihood that they will have tougher issues in the future is there
9096099 you would need some legal and ethical advice but i would not want to pass judgment because it is a personal decision
9096100 the rule with that disclosure is and has been as long as ive been here is that if there is a conflict you are not supposed to vote
9096101 now that was on the books long before i got here
9096102 the law is now is that if there is a conflict you are not supposed to vote not that you are supposed to go and die
9096103 and now personally i think that is the standard that is being applied if you are working in an industry in the state of nevada and you are in public service you should die
9096104 there will be in the next election cycle a phenomenal opportunity for people to participate in the system
9096105 i have been challenging business groups that you need to gear up for this and think about putting up some of your own people
9096106 if you dont participate in actually putting people in the election process then i will submit to you that you are under represented
9096107 bottom line is that if you think the nevada legislature is an ego building experience or that it is going to make you money then you are either an idiot or a crook
9096108 this state has grown because of what it is not
9096109 we want you to pay as much as you can while remaining happy to be here
9096110 for the most of you the reason you are here is because you voted with your feet once before
9096111 its probably easier to see a legislator in nevada than it is to get on an airplane
9096112 you can make a fairly strong contrast between a blank check type bailout which weve seen in recent months in some sectors of the economy and a program that helps the industry transform itself
9096113 i do think the american automobile business is deserving of it because the financial organizations are so stressed right now
9096114 kap is probably one of the fastest quarterbacks in the country hes faster than he was last year
9096115 graz can run hes a quick quarterback kap has a strong arm graz has a strong arm
9096116 its about the whole and the deal is kap is a little bit ahead of graz simply because graz didnt get the time he needed and he needed the time badly
9096117 the most important thing is the efficiency of the quarterback
9096118 our efficiency last year wasnt great because we threw a lot of long touchdown passes and made some big plays
9096119 but the passing percentage was not good and thats what were going after we have to maintain ball control
9096120 were getting better but were not where we should be i dont feel
9096121 and that i think is some of the additions to the offense
9096122 shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9096123 i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country
9096124 that if they are not welcome on the democrats ticket they have a place with republicans
9096125 senator john mccain has made a great pick in governor sarah palin
9096126 first and foremost id tell them its bigger than the quarterback position
9096127 the team is the bigger thing here the whole goal is to win as many football games as you can and get to a bowl game theyve got to keep their head in the game whoever sits on the sidelines is only one play away
9096128 from my perspective and i cant speak for fred our relationship was always good
9096129 we definitely put the team first and our personal feelings second he wanted to be the starter and i wanted to be the starter i felt back then it was good for the team maybe for continuity it wasnt great
9096130 the guy coming off the bench he gets to see whats going on on the field
9096131 its like watching film i shouldnt say theres no pressure on you but i always felt like it was a benefit to come off the bench
9096132 i think the difference between now and 1992 fred was a lot better athlete and kaepernick has that
9096133 the offense was different back then coach ault i cant even believe he came up with this pistol offense i always asked him to put in the shotgun and he always said no the shotgun is terrible he always said you had to take your eyes off the defense you had to look for the ball
9096134 with the pistol you run a lot more bootlegs you get them out on the perimeter hes definitely taking a lot more advantage of guys who can run
9096135 i love him because hes a tough son of a gun i love his attitude hes got such a strong arm you look at kap hes got a strong arm as well and its amazing how fast and quick he is for his height
9096136 im sure the quarterbacks dont feel this way but its a good thing that coach ault has something like this
9096137 the opening of the anwr 1002 area to oil and natural gas development is projected to increase domestic crude oil production starting in 2018 in the mean anwr oil resource case additional oil production resulting from the opening of anwr reaches 780 000 barrels per day 124 000 m d in 2027 and then declines to 710 000 barrels per day 113 000 m d in 2030 in 2007 the united states consumed 20 68 m bbls of petroleum products per day
9096138 if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
9096139 i really believe there are things nobody would see if i didnt photograph them
9096140 i have people calling me in the south and throughout the state
9096141 we are not going to worry about it we are going to worry about managing the state through its worst fiscal crisis in history
9096142 if the mayor decides to come to carson city and tries to lobby the governors office for a tax increase hes going to get the same response as everyone else gets
9096143 a school without football is in danger of being turned into a medieval study hall
9096144 just because you got the monkey off your back doesnt mean the circus has left town
9096145 there i guess king george will be able to read that
9096146 does this hurt as she pressed firmly on the swollen nubby looking portion of the finger in question
9096147 to be honest with you i have no idea what it is
9096148 duuuuh i am kakashi and i have forgotten everything just keep swimming just keep swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming what do we do we swim
9096149 talking nonsense in the hall only this and that is all
9096150 hes just rehearsing ere he tries with her conversing and then will he require nursing when her reply makes his face fall when she breaks his poor heart in half perhaps shell sneer perhaps shell laugh at his most monumental gaffe when at last he confesses all confesses that he loves her true not just now but for the long haul will he sulk or will he bawl
9096151 let us give it an honest try surely this thing of i dont need a social life must someday pall may i escort you to the dance there to waltz and there to prance is there at least a little chance that youll be my date you doll to spin around the floor and perhaps enjoy the costume ball
9096152 to tell her plainly to her face that he yearns to her embrace cause in his heart she takes first place as the fairest of them all and now hes begging for a date i wonder if perhaps hell crawl to coax her to dare the ball
9096153 was it too hasty to invite you to next weeks costume ball perhaps i ask too much too soon but this is only early june could you sing a different tune if i tried again for fall when leaves now green are falling red could you please dance with me in fall
9096154 maybe dancings not your style but tell me what youd like and ill shut up about the silly ball there must be something that a pal could do with you in some locale as long as it wont make you scowl i will try it once big or small is there aught we could do jointly to give you glee however small
9096155 now thats a shocking thing to hear from one whos been an ally dear not just for me but for all the team whenever theres a brawl and now it seems youd find no cheer month after month year after year in anything wed engineer to create fun for one and all i suppose you even hated that time we played some stankball
9096156 if it does not strain unduly say it quick and say it truly do you want me to leave withal to drop this topic here and now and quick and quiet leave withal
9096157 then sure i wont be depriving you of my company after all and as long as we are sharing this quiet time ill be daring ill ask if it would be scaring you if i kissed you in this hall yes do you want to leave without kissing here and now in this hall
9096158 twas a curse of spite severest to discourage true loves call
9096159 milder than the curse on snow white but similar in hindsight true loves first kiss would set it right if that event could me befall but real wooers dont force kisses on their most beloved misses hence the victim sneers and hisses or calls his tender words banal the same old words the same old lines the same old sentiments banal did you guess this you green doll
9096160 you should know raven that a friend has been so craven as to spy upon our confab as we stood here in this hall earlier i heard him working then all was quiet he was shirking his repairs and just plain lurking right behind that bathroom wall do you see that little glitter in that new hole low in the wall cyborgs spycam saw it all
9096161 should i charge out through the doorway and go racing down the hall
9096162 thatll wait ive been missing months and months of proper kissing which the pesky curse did forestall so for lost time lets start making up until the dawn is breaking did i mention youll be taking me to that silly costume ball but later i will find cyborg and then ill really make him squall

9096167 i will not raise taxes on the people of california
9096168 look i cut to the chase i know what the democrats like and i know what the republicans like so i say lets meet somewhere in the middle
9096169 i like it way better than the 3 4 especially for an inside guy
9096170 all ive got to do is run around and make plays
9096171 he hasnt been a true middle linebacker since high school but it is his true natural position
9096172 and hes taken to it at first he wasnt comfortable making all the calls but thats in the past he knows the defense now and hes making all the calls which really calms down some of the new guys
9096173 after going through it in the spring im a lot more comfortable with it
9096174 the coaches have gone over with me throughout this spring about being more vocal out there trying to get the guys going guys that are lagging out there not making plays
9096175 last year was last year we just want to improve
9096176 he cant just be a player for us he has to be a production player
9096177 he cant just make seven tackles a game he has to be a dominant player period he has to step up and be a dominator he has to
9096178 youve got your role players and your production players and our production players on defense need to make it happen that didnt happen last year they need to make plays and they need to be consistent
9096179 my biggest concern is on the defensive side of the ball
9096180 we have to dramatically improve that side and we will one way or another we will
9096181 we expect josh to be a leader on the defense and i expect him to be one of the better linebackers in the conference
9096182 i think this defense is predicated on all guys making plays
9096183 but obviously the guy in the middle gets to go sideline to sideline so its hard to run away from him
9096184 now its a matter of what we do up front
9096185 hes such a smart kid and a hard working guy hes played so much football for us
9096186 his play his demeanor and how hard he goes about the weight room academics his life i think hes a leader just by every time he steps into or out of the locker room its a big responsibility for him when things are going tough somebodys got to pick this team up but theres not many things he doesnt excel at because he works so hard at everything in his life

9096190 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9096191 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9096218 i just want to be a regular teenager like everybody else
9096219 especially with all the stories you hear about children dying in hot cars theres no reason anyone should be disciplined that way
9096220 abby had on a red shirt yesterday and she was as red as the shirt
9096221 nobody would be quiet so the bus driver turned off the air conditioner and would not let us roll the windows down or anything
9096222 she said they would even be in worse trouble if they rolled the windows down
9096223 so here they are in 96 98 degree weather and all these kids with no air
9096224 i can understand children needing to have some consequences if theyre not doing what theyre supposed to do but you dont turn the air conditioning off especially in houston with the weather the way it is
9096225 then what happened was that she went ahead and said that she would turn off the air conditioner you know trying to get them to be quiet
9096226 im still mad about it but at least they have done something
9096227 we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9096228 its like doing a jigsaw to create a dieng information system
9096229 so far dieng has remained a site of mystery with very little scientific data available amid numerous myths circulating in society
9096230 this highland can be a special place for honeymooners dieng only lacks promotion so it is less familiar to people from other regions
9096231 we are now regularly replanting the forest to restore the natural harmony of dieng
9096232 without any alternative it is difficult to halt the expansion of potato plantations because the crop has become a source of living for part of the community
9096233 if obama loses ra cism is the only reason mccain might beat him
9096234 breaking news how many houses will she add to the ticket
9096235 sarah palin is to the movement for womens equality what clarence thomas is to civil rights
9096236 sarah palin has a great deal of surface appeal at first but once americas women look behind that cheerleader smile and see at her extreme social agenda they will run the other direction
9096237 mccain picked a fan not an equal partner she has no international experience she was just fawning all over him no independence given mccains temper sarah palin probably wont challenge john mccain on any substantive issues
9096238 the only thing he is going to let her do in the white house is teach him how to use the internet
9096239 palin makes mccain look ancient out of touch and totally yesterday mccain makes her look like a perky kid each one dramatically and perfectly underscores the others weakness at least nobody can criticize obamas alleged youth and inexperience now but this is not the best team america could produce by any stretch
9096240 to the extent the experience qualifications and national security arguments are taken off the table obama wins
9096241 since my arrest it has been extremely stressful both personally and financially
9096242 the sadness and despair in my mothers eyes is worse than any jail cell you may put me in
9096243 it is critically important to get social security payments to people all along the gulf coast
9096244 delivering these checks early to residents from texas to florida eliminates one concern people might have as they prepare for the storm as beneficiaries take steps to ensure their own safety this is one step we can take to help them in a difficult time in the future beneficiaries should be mindful that direct deposit is a more secure and convenient way to receive payments particularly when natural disasters strike
9096245 we just dont believe that there was malicious intent for personal gain but he did violate our policies by taking this information out of the building
9096246 theyre trying to keep it quiet because they dont want to jinx the whole thing
9096247 i can understand why people go outside the u s you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying
9096248 can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9096249 ive always wanted to have babies and adopt when i was little i remember seeing tv shows and a child would be adopted and be happy i just always felt like there are so many kids out there who need a parent
9096250 i can sit at my piano for what seems like five minutes but when i look at the clock its three in the morning

9096277 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9096278 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want

9096319 although these days with the v8 engines it is no problem taking the eau rouge combination in the hollow at full throttle it remains a standout feature compression is absolutely no problem physically but its nevertheless a very special sensation for the spectators too i can well recommend this section its very impressive the way the cars come roaring along downhill and then accelerate uphill again

9096327 in an interview with roll call two weeks ago alaska gov sarah palin r said she had met presumptive gop presidential nominee sen john mccain only once or twice
9096328 about the position before offering it in person earlier this week
9096329 hes betting his presidency on a naked political play for holdout hillary supporters and other female swing voters and hoping that a large share of these predominantly pro choice women will ignore or overlook palins staunch pro life anti stem cell views

9096350 many said it seemed like you were trying to blend organic tones with the mechanical industrial side
9096351 fulfilled its purpose as far as being a first record the blending of the mechanical and organic tones was more of an experiment than anything else yet it captured who
9096352 was even finished being mixed so we have a plethora to choose from as of now we are going into the studio to record disc 2 in january with producer

9096354 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9096355 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9096356 suggested the prime minister consider stepping down or dissolving the house of representatives as possible options
9096357 nos urge a nosotros y a ellos la victoria en t rminos generales son abiertos as son los partidos que juegan las chivas en el jalisco van para adelante y dejan unos espacios que el rival siempre trata de aprovechar se puede volver un partido de ida y vuelta como fue con santos donde el marcador fue 5 3
9096358 son muy coordinados sus movimientos y con vocaci n ofensiva tiende a ir hacia delante y eso debemos aprovechar nosotros tener la pelota y atacar creo que nos van a dejar espacios
9096359 siempre son partidos especiales a n cuando nosotros sabemos que todos valen los mismos puntos pero jugar contra alguien tan importante como guadalajara m s a n con las circunstancias que tenemos nosotros despu s de haber perdido dos partidos
9096360 the queen enjoyed poetry walter raleigh wrote verses for her his musical voice made pictures of the words they both had quick minds the two of them would toss sentences back and forth each trying to better the other this was refreshing to the queen walter raleigh made her feel young again
9096361 written especially for children who love adventure and exploration into the unknown
9096362 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
9096363 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
9096364 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the
9096365 before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you came to birth i consecrated you
9096366 der vorstand der commerzbank w rde keine verhandlungen f hren von denen er glauben muss dass er sie nicht finanzieren kann

9096368 the only way to not lose is to not play
9096369 government can not solve all problems but there are some things that it can do
9096370 you do this n that and then youre on your own
9096371 so what were those problems that the government could not solve
9096372 how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a mans property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
9096373 and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
9096374 a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
9096375 but fha federal housing authority and the veterans administration tell us they have 120 000 housing units theyve taken back through mortgage foreclosure
9096376 no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so governments programs once launched never disappear
9096377 there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that social security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble
9096378 it is particularly significant that a conservative woman was nominated for the nations second highest office
9096379 for years the feminist movement has acknowledged for leadership only those women who embrace a radical agenda how refreshing that now we have a woman who reflects the values of mainstream american women sarah palin is pro life pro marriage and pro family she is a woman who is balancing the personal and professional in admirable ways she is an outstanding woman who will be an excellent role model for the nations young people sarah palin is chief among equals with american professional women she brings the kind of balance that characterizes the high achieving women of today she will bring to the forefront of our cultural conversations an intelligent realistic well grounded womans perspective
9096380 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9096381 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9096382 to assume that women will simply support governor palin because of her gender is insulting in fact the governor is out of step with mainstream america on womens economic and social issues for example governor palin embraces john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and protecting a womens right to make her own health care decisions
9096383 governor palin has also enthusiastically supported the bush mccain doctrine of standing up for big oil and failed economic policies that has led to a struggling economy
9096384 charter has finally acknowledged that peg needs to be on the basic analog tier were very pleased that theyve listened
9096385 why move them from spots that many of these channels had had for over 30 years its going to cause customer confusion
9096386 we believe delivering more hd channels to our customers is the right thing to do and properly responds to the many requests we receive from our customers
9096387 it is a very smart decision by charter executives who have been trying their best to manage the transition to digital as fast as possible and at the same time maximize the value of the analog channels
9096388 tenemos que levantar la cara ser optimistas pensar en levantar al equipo debemos confiar en nuestro trabajo en lo que estamos haciendo porque los resultados van a llegar no tengo duda de que as ser y ojal que sea a partir de este s bado
9096389 ha jugado bien defensivamente nos hemos comportado bien ha habido algunas distracciones pero el equipo lo ha hecho bien en todos los aspectos
9096390 no se han dado los resultados pero no es porque se juegue mal al futbol sino porque no hemos tenido la fortuna de concretar las buenas jugadas en el partido
9096391 acaban de ganar a media semana y deben tener la moral arriba nosotros tenemos que tener la misma disposici n as que vamos por los tres puntos
9096392 i just needed to do something i wanted to help
9096393 it was like the dog was trying to rip pieces of meat off
9096394 i couldnt see her face because the head was all bloody i guess he was biting her head too

9096396 theres two sides to every story and wait until you hear the other side of the story
9096397 yeah we are just trying to get the other side
9096398 im going to give you the other side but its got to be the proper time
9096399 anybody that hunts moose at 3 in the mornin is high on my list
9096400 he is 72 every 72 year old has a significant risk of heart complications
9096401 in looking at the front page i find zero evidence of a mccain agenda being pushed
9096402 sorry cindy im going to be hitting the trail with sarah err mrs palin for the next few days shes going to show me her favorite drilling site
9096403 at what point will most people suddenly realize that mccain is actually less interested in governing than in politics
9096404 mccain could have opened the phone book in any town in the us closed his eyes and slapped his finger down on a name 100 times and ever time made a better choice than you guys
9096405 shes a foreign policy hawk who voted against democrats to sell clusterbombs to countries we specifically know are going to bomb women and children
9096406 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9096407 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9096408 maybe we should check to see if these candidates are linked to oil profiteers
9096409 we just believe that athletes should have the freedom to express themselves and their christian values wherever they go
9096410 i feel we made a lot of inroads and had a great impact in china
9096411 in this day and age people need to see something wholesome and real
9096412 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9096413 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9096414 el partido fue tal cual como lo hab amos vislumbrado sab amos que ellos iban a jugar atr s al error que iba a ser muy parecido a lo que nos hizo el arsenal o c cuta y que iban a estar esperando a que nos equivocaramos para aprovechar
9096415 de hecho hasta la misma formaci n que esper bamos se dio con dos l neas de cuatro un delantero retrasado y uno fijo que iba buscando las esquinas pero creo que lo supimos descifrar de buena manera
9096416 because aig travel guard is a leading global insurance provider we have the resources and infrastructure in place to assist in emergency situations like this issue with zoom airlines
9096417 we want travelers to know that we are here to help even if they did not purchase travel insurance and we will be increasing staff support in our command and control center to do whatever we can to assist stranded canadian and british passengers its the right thing to do
9096418 also i will no longer be working on the jailbreak version of pocketmoney all development will be focuses on the appstore version for iphone 2 0
9096419 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9096420 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9096421 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9096422 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9096423 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9096424 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

9096426 the transaero 747 descended 60 to 90 metres after receiving an alert from its traffic collision avoidance system
9096427 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9096428 out of sight out of mind i should have remembered the old adage look before you leap
9096429 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9096430 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 per cent
9096431 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9096432 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labour and housing markets search for their bottoms
9096433 in the face of gale force winds from the housing credit and commodity markets the economy continues to bend but not break
9096434 we saw a slight improvement in auto sales in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
9096435 have spelled recession other indicators not a divergence that should continue in the week ahead
9096436 while economic growth seems to be in the minds of everybody i still worry about inflation
9096437 the trend is clearly upwards and will continue to remain on that path if the federal reserve continues to be as irresponsible as it has been until now
9096438 how long can a business keep prices constant when facing an almost 10 per cent increase in the price of its inputs

9096442 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9096443 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9096444 i like making aquariums with all the fishes and sharks its one of the best things i have done this summer
9096445 we basically had two different sets of summer camps this year a traveling camp for children aged 5 to 11 and a theme camp for children aged 2 to 4
9096446 everyday was something different either a different theme or a different trip
9096447 it was opened only for us and lifeguards were provided
9096448 my favorite trip this summer was when we visited the crayola factory because we got to see how they make crayons and markers
9096449 then we got to keep a box of markers and crayons
9096450 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9096451 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9096452 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9096453 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9096454 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9096455 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9096456 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9096457 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9096458 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9096459 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9096460 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9096461 to hesitate pause or express doubt when asked to make a decision
9096462 ive been offered a contract on my novel when an author is offered a deal and they dont yet have an agent should they seek one at that point and if an agent accepts should the agent still get 15 of the royalties even though he or she didnt market that book or secure the deal for them
9096463 if i already have an offer from a publisher will an agent negotiate the contract for a fee
9096464 do agents ever go after a persons story if they think it would make a great book
9096465 hey congratulations have you ever thought about doing a book
9096466 how common is it for an author who writes for both the cba and aba markets to have separate agents for each
9096467 there are a couple famous authors soliciting stories for compilation books right now i know its a longshot that mine is selected but if it is and i use notes from my book in progress would i ever be able to use my thoughts again in a different form

9096478 i am concerned that there are still a number of persons who are still unaccounted for
9096479 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9096480 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9096481 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9096482 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9096483 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9096484 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9096485 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9096486 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9096487 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9096488 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9096489 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9096490 right before i went to get the cops he was laying in the street in front of their car

9096493 even with gas prices falling across the state this has been a tough summer economically for many nevada families
9096494 this coupled with the fact that many schools have already started classes is leading many families to stay home this holiday weekend
9096495 this cfjqajax is a library of custom tags that replicate the cfgrid cfwindow and cftooltip tags from coldfusion 8 the cf8 tags work but i find yui and ext much harder to work with than jquery and the file size of the javascript libraries that cf8 includes is excessive so i created cfjqajax
9096496 high availability enhanced security fine grained application optimization individualized application administration and clustering
9096497 what advantages does bluedragon net have over coldfusion 8 for running multiple instances
9096498 here are the results of preliminary testing over 1 minute cf7 381 pages served blue dragon 1007 pages served so blue dragon served up 164 more pages or 2 6 times the number of pages as cf 7 running on the same server this is very encouraging

9096500 your story that the cape coastline would disappear in 25 years would cause alarm and despondency here in cape town but for two things firstly the writer is better known for his political satire and secondly the study appears to have been written with the help of the south african weather bureau notorious for giving the wrong weather forecasts for the cape is this perhaps the trial run for next years april fools day
9096501 i believe that global warming is the biggest scientific scam ever there is no evidence to prove that the current climate variations are not a natural cycle
9096502 we dont want to sell it to you for that price
9096503 i consider the violence against women act the single most significant legislation that ive crafted during my 35 year tenure in the senate s ince we passed the act in 1994 over a million women have found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence protective orders
9096504 thats a compliment to our guys because theyve worked really hard defensively
9096505 theyve worked really hard to learn our system our players are all a year older they really know what theyre doing out there the really played solid defense ronight
9096506 it was a great run by blake and we had a great build up by the entire team
9096507 blake cut inside weve been working on diagonal through balls this week when blake cut through he played the ball to me we have a good chemistry that weve been working on the past couple of weeks its something weve been working on
9096508 playing clemson brings out the best in everybody obviously this is the biggest game of our season and it comes right off the bat
9096509 everyone comes in fresh and adrenaline is really flowing it just a matter of taking your opportunities and putting them away
9096510 this was one of the bigger margins in a while
9096511 its a good solid win i think our players feel really good about it i felt we had control and dictated a lot of the play
9096512 we got into the attack pretty well and had some chances
9096513 but we werent able to capitalize on as many as i would have liked to clemson is a good team and its a rivalry game theres a lot of jitters on the part of both teams i was really proud of the way our guys handled that i thought it was a very team effort over these guys
9096514 we dont want to sell it to you for that price
9096515 a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of midnight sun that left her possession and each was unique
9096516 in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
9096517 i am sad for her but angry at her at the same time
9096518 noooooooo can someone please call email stalk her and tell her she must write midnight sun how can this happen why leave us this way we can wait but why indefinately who the hell leaked it they should be flogged i think im gonna cry we just want to know what edward is thinking when he is in the meadow with bella and then when he stays at her house im gonna cry
9096519 its funny because when it first leaked everyone was really excited because so many of the fans who read it were really hyping it up and that it was really good
9096520 shell put it on hold long enough to create buzz when the buzz reaches fever pitch shell release it and make bank can you please find a new bs pitch the buzz creation tactic is old
9096521 although i am very upset with this news i can understand where stephenie meyer is coming from writing is an art whatever your mood is it is reflected in your work i am sorry that this has happened i hope that after taking some time to calm down and get past this betrayal she will feel differently this has been a whirlwind for her and everything has happened so fast she needs to take some time for herself and just enjoy herself we will be patient and wait for as long as it takes if midnight sun doesnt get released we should be grateful for everything she has done and given us is such a short time
9096522 she gave the manuscript to someone which means the leak started from her

9096536 we played really hard in the first half we knew that morehead state was going to be an aggressive team and we knew we were going to have to match their intensity level
9096537 i thought that we played hard and that was the difference for us tonight even though we did not play as well as i had hoped
9096538 we have had some trouble scoring goals earlier in the season but some of our kids really turned it on in front of the net tonight
9096539 i am so happy to celebrate here and see some of the fans who supported me
9096540 its great to feel so much excitement around the sport of swimming in the u s and around the world to top it all off with a parade at disney world is just incredible
9096541 i have agreed in principle to accept the december 6 fight against oscar de la hoya
9096542 this will be the toughest test in my boxing career because of the reach and height advantage of my esteemed opponent aside from his great boxing skills
9096543 this fight however will not be a walk in the park for oscar de la hoya the boxing fans will see the same fire and intensity they have witnessed in my previous fights

9096558 do you see what i say usually the first time you say that they look at you like what but you have to see what i say in your mind if i have to draw it for you in the heat of the battle youre lost
9096559 but now looking back there are so many more things im aware of now that i had no understanding of last year
9096560 it puts things in perspective i think a lot has been said about the numbers that were put up last year but ive always been one to focus on the ones that matter the turnovers and the wins and the losses and those stats were very poor and most of that in this offense is correlated with the quarterback position
9096561 no matter what i could have told him or said or what we attempted to put him through in practice nothing prepares you for your first year doesnt matter if youre a freshman or not
9096562 hes better at recognizing defenses at understanding protections at knowing where hot outlets are when they do blitz and what to do he is leap years ahead of where he was last season different people see the light at different times
9096563 i say shes up in the stands she loves you throw her the ball once in a while
9096564 my first spring ball going into that fall camp and into the season i struggled with throwing the ball away thats a hard thing as a quarterback you want to make a play but sometimes the best play is dropping it down to a running back or throwing it to mom
9096565 there are so many more things that im aware of now that i had no understanding of last year
9096566 its understanding the opportunity you have i have every opportunity to take this thing wherever i want it to go
9096567 i know right from wrong now its a matter of becoming consistent with it its all on me recognizing it and doing it i want to play right now
9096568 we are pained and shocked at the merciless killings and unabated violence against the christians all over the state of orissa

9096571 the houses churches and prayer halls have to be rebuilt and a sense of security has to be restored in the hearts of christians and other affected people

9096589 the investigation has determined the couple had just left the service station when the driver swerved to avoid a deer
9096590 the passenger had not fastened his seatbelt prior to leaving the service station this contributed to him being ejected

9096637 going through these new teacher orientations theyve focused on the fact that we will be working closely its not a closed door policy the door is always open people are always there to help you so that relieves a lot of the nerves that you obviously have in the beginning
9096638 getting things ready for the students as far as what is the 4th grade curriculum we all know what the curriculum is its there for us but what do you do in endwell in september and really be able to get the first month under your belt planned and being able to see ok this is where were going and this is how we get the year started because if you get a good start then the year goes smoothly

9096640 microsofts position in the search market in europe is not that great
9096641 investing in this kind of business with search advertisements and millions of people in its community makes sense
9096642 we are investing heavily in emea because we see this as an interesting market for us and an opportunity to provide better services to consumers
9096643 we have a good search product in the us but we want to improve the product in emea for that you need local merchants and technology tailored to european needs
9096644 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
9096645 it just lights up my whole world when max laughs being a mother just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible
9096646 the church was coming out of the catacombs and there was fear of being too exposed nevertheless we began the greek catholics agreed with us and something really useful was undertaken
9096647 those young people deeply immersed in their faith as well as those who havent had much to do with the church
9096648 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire

9096650 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire
9096651 really its almost a post graduate project collections can be so broad and complicated so it was very interesting to me to watch the process unfold and see how we could actually talk about collections
9096652 i thought it to be simple i know what collecting is
9096653 it was great to bring these guys in and watch them fire questions at the burnets why this
9096654 philippe really made it clear that the key element to any working group is to function democratically
9096655 we started exploring collecting ideas versus objects multiple kinds of objects or a single type of object
9096656 and it was like a lead balloon totally silent and i realized it was really a live situation there was an out and they didnt take it
9096657 and we wanted to represent the corruption of that truth
9096658 for teen issues but even at my age too its that the worlds not what they told us it would be and we must reconcile expectation with experience
9096659 but the project provided me with a more realistic perspective of art collections and collectors
9096660 talking about collections in this group was a passionate base for discussion
9096661 if you dont talk to them youll never get to know them
9096662 politically adults tend to call names and not discuss problems but children tend to ask the question
9096663 kids dont know other kids are homeless its sobering to a 12 year old when confronted with issues of homelessness the general public never meets people who are homeless only those like themselves through this experience next time folks are faced with the issue they will have new perspective
9096664 this is an opportunity to sit and meet with folks youve never met and exchange ideas
9096665 are you willing to fundamentally understand that were here to take care of one another
9096666 were here to give to the children of homeless families to make it memorable for their trip to st
9096667 you dont have to be liberal or conservative just bring a meal and talk
9096668 even though some delegates wont pay any attention to what the demonstrators are talking about its not a deterrent there will be massive media intensely focused on st paul
9096669 the plight of homelessness is almost off the radar screen in terms of media coverage these days with the foreclosure debt and housing crisis it should bring attention to the fact that homelessness is growing the factors that lead to homelessness are not being diminished
9096670 there are more homeless families now than ever before and we want people to be aware of that
9096671 this is a picnic where peoples eyes will be opened
9096672 ive been a fireman for more than 30 years and there is something very special and unique about the relationship of firemen they live together eat together and sleep together just like family members i just dont believe mixing the races works in this case
9096673 were a bar for alternative subversive and counterculture clientele the actual intention of pi is to be a place for all people who are subversive or progressive in some way not only lesbian or gay
9096674 this carnival will be a jumping off point making a statement reflecting who we are im dismayed in some ways with the seeming lack of momentum of social justice movements we need to reinvigorate the counterculture movement and thats why pi is here we are good at bringing people together its a magical place here worlds collide

9096680 as a chinese i really got very excited last night it was beyond my imagination from the very beginning i could tell its about china not propaganda we he and friends who watched the ceremony together cheered from the deepest part of our hearts

9096682 giving the chinese the olympics is the worst awarding mistake since 1980

9096692 brandon erickson has an interesting post about an experiment on players emotional reactions to
9096693 death of the players own character appear s to increase some aspects of positive emotion
9096694 part of this has to do with the intriguing aesthetic question of precisely how the first person shooter represents the player after the moment of death
9096695 this sudden switch in camera angle from first person to third person is in essence a classic out of body experience of exactly the sort people describe in near death experiences and much like real life near death experiences it tends to suffuse me with a curiously zen like feeling

9096800 additionally there is a need to tighten enforcement on premises that operate without licences
9096801 from the 1 025 applications received between 2005 and november 2007 204 or 19 9 per cent were approved beyond the stipulated three month time frame
9096802 however since last year the council had set a three week deadline for the technical departments to give their feedback
9096803 in our opinion the councils enforcement in this area is unsatisfactory as the number of illegal businesses is still high
9096804 the drop was due to lack of enforcement officers at the non motorised vehicular unit since july 2006 enforcement activities were only conducted by one officer for the entire island

9096812 it just depends on how intense that meeting was with nascar and how serious they are about the probation
9096813 im sure there are probations that are kind of like a slap on the hand and then there are probations where they might have you buy the shirt saying you do this again youre really in trouble thats really where the question lies its one word but there might be many levels to it

9096818 the probation will be far back in their minds but its not going to change how they race and what they do i wish they would decide to wreck each other in the chase opener at new hampshire but i know thats not going to be the case

9096840 fema and its federal partners are in close communications with states along its potential path in order to review plans pre station assets and personnel and respond to any request for assistance femas work with states using a gap analysis tool to determine in advance of storms where federal assistance is most likely to be needed has helped federal and state agencies to develop pre scripted mission assignments and other contingency plans to help improve response and recovery efforts
9096841 federal agencies have begun distributing more than 182 000 public alert radios to preschools head start programs k 12 nonpublic schools and nonpublic school central offices k 12 school district offices and post secondary schools in two earlier phases the federal government distributed radios to all 97 000 k 12 public schools across the country bringing the program to a close this september with a life saving radio in every school in the nation
9096842 the radios are distributed by the us department of commerces national oceanic and atmospheric administration with funding from the department of homeland security and assistance from the departments of education and health and human services
9096843 the arrls response to his queries though lengthy attempts to address them in detail with toms permission we are releasing both his original e mail and the arrls response in order to get the most accurate and full information out to repeater owners and users as possible it also gives us the opportunity to make sure a couple of other issues relating to the pave paws situation that have arisen are brought to the publics attention
9096844 the balance between not being able to know full technical details of the interference and the testing techniques and the desire need to know information its a tough challenge and while there have been a few errors in identifying call signs because of errors in databases being used by the air force there were actual measurements made of signals identified by the air force testing group
9096845 very likely the longest 2 meter qso via tropospheric propagation for either country
9096846 radio waves that are refracted by natural gradients in the index of refraction of air with altitude due to changes in temperature humidity and pressure
9096847 ducting takes place when refraction is so great that radio waves are bent back to the surface of the earth when tropospheric ducting conditions exist over a wide geographic area signals may remain very strong over distances of 1500 km 930 miles or more ducting results from the gradient created by a sharp increase in temperature with altitude quite the opposite of normal atmospheric conditions a simultaneous drop in humidity contributes to increased refractivity useful temperature inversions form between 250 and 2000 meters 800 6500 feet above ground the elevated inversion and the earths surface act something like the boundaries of a natural open ended waveguide radio waves of the right frequency range caught inside the duct will be propagated for long distances with relatively low losses several common weather conditions can create temperature inversions
9096848 went to bed at about 08 30 utc leaving the rig on and antennas pointing toward reunion i woke up at 00 15 utc and heard the beacon from my shack i went over and saw that signals were low even with the masthead pre amp on i was running to confirm hard copy of the signal but it was not decoding i switched off the pre amp and returned to bed about an hour later i heard the beacon again but much stronger so i went to the shack and saw the signal at almost 1 on the s meter perfect hard copy from cwget i contacted phil on his cell phone switched the linear and pre amp on and we logged a ssb qso and fm qso on 144 200 and 144 400 at 01 39 utc on august 14 with signal reports of 5 6 both ways
9096849 at 0135 utc on august 14 glenn is calling me on my cell phone that means the beacon is heard strong enough to allow a qso its 0535 local time here i speak low and run into the shack switch off the beacon and call on 144 200 to see glenns signal at 55 56 with the preamp we decide to try fm and i have clear copy on him time goes fast we stop the qso some 20 or 30 minutes later but the band was still nicely open the signal was crystal clear almost no fading if any on my side whooaaaa the first bridge is now there between south africa and reunion island
9096850 while operating there as zr2bi in the late 1970s i heard an unidentified south american station on 2 meters since then having moved to the us i was not able to pursue it any further this last january i started e mailing a lot of people in southern africa and st helena but found little activity pursuing the potential tropo resorting to my old ways of using fm broadcast stations as beacons i asked john turner on st helena island to listen for african stations within days he reported stations from angola then namibia and eventually as far south as cape town one february day he logged 25 south african fm broadcasters in 30 minutes and that was with his car radio
9096851 all those reports led to phil mondon putting up the beacon
9096852 the best known such duct is the hawaiian duct which links the west coast of the us especially california with the big island of hawaii but we have also known that other such ducts exist in different places around the world although the ham populations in these areas are often so low that we hardly ever experience two way communications the indian ocean is one such place this outstanding contact between phil mondon fr5dn on reunion island and glen kraut zs2gk in south africa confirms the existence of a path between the mainland and islands in the indian ocean it follows the detection of fm broadcast stations on similar paths in the south atlantic ocean between the island of st helena and angola namibia and capetown on the mainland and reports of reception of brazilian fm stations on ascension island in the south atlantic

9096854 the approach he took to public service is particularly admirable
9096855 he was motivated not by financial gain or personal notoriety but instead by what he could honestly do to make fairbanks a better stronger community
9096856 we were regarded as pretty weird birds by almost everyone in the industry
9096857 he had the leadership he had the temperament he set the tone of the assembly after several tumultuous years when there were some colorful opinionated and strong characters in it
9096858 i have a deep respect for hank hove i believe any success i may have had i attribute to hank
9096859 in his nine years serving on the assembly he was presiding officer for seven consecutive years
9096860 i felt that was a testament to his ability as a leader that the assembly and its various members through that nine year span continued to elect him as their presiding officer that is pretty unusual
9096861 finally one day i said to him you know big guy youre suppose to be upstairs in the big office on the third floor
9096862 there was just this comfort level since we had worked so closely for so many years i have very fond memories of him and i am very saddened by this
9096863 he taught me discipline and how to listen to others and respect their opinions even if i didnt agree with it
9096864 keep your opinion in your back pocket he made that very clear and expected all of his reporters to honor that he always wanted all of us to be respectful to everyone in the community
9096865 hank and i didnt always agree but over the years i came to appreciate his absolute commitment to operating a tv station that truly served the community
9096866 anything that had to do for the betterment of fairbanks he was there as those things happened
9096867 he was a genuine person with a wonderful wry sense of humor and he didnt mind hitting someone over the head with a stick if it was called for he was a wonderful man in every sense of the word a gentleman and i only respect and admire him
9096868 it was always that big booming baritone that quiet dignified roar that could be heard throughout the station
9096869 when he said something you paid attention you couldnt help it
9096870 it was impressive and inspiring to all of us who knew him
9096871 he didnt have to step into that arena he truly wanted to make the fairbanks north star borough a better place to live
9096872 he liked to build radio equipment from scratch which is not done by many today
9096873 i inherited one of the amplifiers he built the construction work is without peer
9096874 whenever i had real estate issues before the borough you not only had to prove your case but you had to do better go beyond in proving your point
9096875 you didnt always win him over he wanted to be fair
9096876 i was sorry to see hank leave fairbanks he left the community but i dont think his heart ever left he developed close friendships with people and he kept in touch with people
9096877 he was only mayor one term but sometimes you get the right person at the right time
9096878 treat others as you would want to be treated yourself

9096983 see see i totally told you i was random and crazy you just never know what im going to do next
9096984 i was at a place called invesco field when a man named barack obama with a background like no other major party presidential nominee in u s history beat the odds
9096985 all of this is about her future and all the possibilities it means for her
9096986 the first black president would be just the beginning of a lot of dreams that can come true
9096987 i even had to apologize to a friend in washington d c
9096988 but thats one of the great things about the obama campaign things that people believe arent possible are suddenly possible
9096989 never in my wildest dreams did i believe i would live to see this happen
9096990 i thought what can i do in my little corner to see this happen
9096991 some guys are saying mean things about the cartoon im working on ill show them
9096992 i think we should start potty training junior this weekend
9096993 you get a chocolate frog when you go to the toilet in an appropriate and sustainable manner
9096994 begins with the question what do children need and how can we meet those needs rather than how can we get kids to do whatever we tell them it helps parents to move from techniques that emphasize control and conditional acceptance to an approach designed to help kids grow into good people
9096995 the point here is not to call into question the importance of supporting and encouraging children the need to love them and hug them and help them feel good about themselves praise however is a different story entirely heres why
9096996 we noticed the same pattern when we looked at changes in wiki pages virginia governor tim kaine and some of the other potential democratic candidates
9096997 we saw a lot of accuracy and footnote changes on bidens while on kaines page there were a few but not too many also a couple of the same editors were working on both the obama and biden wiki pages
9096998 sometimes youll have personnel at private airports who see activity and discuss it on blogs and forums saying hey i noticed this person leaving in the dead of night
9096999 you can put your hand in your pocket and no one will care
9097000 but millions of patients in other countries could profit from this some countries have 10 times more amputees than we do
9097001 we have our clients do simple movements that mimic the activity theyre going to do to get the joints and ligaments warmed up increase muscle temperature and increase core temperature
9097002 a good warm up should include about 10 minutes of activity thats also a time when you can clear your head and focus on what you want to accomplish during the workout
9097003 people dont understand about maintaining their trunk and spine stability while lifting weights theyre just throwing the weights up rather than lifting the weights and im thinking oh my god i can hear their back screaming
9097004 when doing weights on a fixed machine youre making an isolated movement and strengthening your body in this one position so you relax your core because the bench is giving you stability free weights and cables are much more functional so thats where the deeper understanding of the core comes into play core strength and core control can be a stabilizer and an anchor if i want my core to work as a stabilizer i want to maintain a nice proper posture and then do the movement slow down initially and connect to the movement properly dont worry about how much weight youre lifting once you understand how to do it let your body be your guide to how much weight and how many reps you should do
9097005 guys especially always want to lift as much as they can
9097006 i hate to say it but guys need to check their ego at the door when you realize you cant move a weight properly be smart about it drop the weight and go lighter
9097007 ive seen everything from a sore back to a pulled hamstring and quad in terms of bigger injuries ive seen people tear their pectorals doing a bench press thats just a nasty injury the nagging injuries are fairly common people tweaking their back and those are preventable
9097008 its great that the enthusiasm is there but you have to pace yourself this is a lifestyle change youre in it for the long run take your time and let the muscles mature as you develop them
9097009 i see a lot of bad form especially protracted shoulders
9097010 you shouldnt rotate your shoulder while youre working another muscle group for example your shoulders shouldnt be rolling while youre doing a bicep curl pressing the shoulders down and squeezing the rhomboids muscles in the upper back will lock in the shoulder girdle and keep that area stable enough to get the muscle group youre working to carry the majority of the weight
9097011 the quicker you can reach overload by going slower the more effective the muscle contraction and the results
9097012 we feel we can help many more people than were helping now
9097013 our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that twenty one is not working a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
9097014 there is a growing body of knowledge that suggests strong reasons for parents and other concerned people to try to keep alcohol out of the hands of young people as long as we can
9097015 back in the 1970s when states started lowering the drinking age to 18 thats when this experiment began there were increases in traffic fatalities and people said lets go back to the way it was we forget there is so much science and historical context here we have been down this road before
9097016 this is a public health problem and a medical problem
9097017 its about the national failure to recognize addiction as a disease if we think of it as kids behaving badly or breaking the rules that gets in the way
9097018 it is the most well studied alcohol control policy we have in this country
9097019 usually we find no effect when we do policy studies here we have this policy effect that is very consistent a big chunk of the studies showing this inverse relationship
9097020 not have an adverse impact on the nutritional adequacy of the overall diet
9097021 an irradiated product looks normal but has invisible reductions in vitamins and nutrients
9097022 its an attempt to fix the problem at the end of the line instead of going to the source
9097023 its the best and only step in the production process to ensure a pathogen free product
9097024 we havent done a good job on educating kids we kind of demonize alcohol on one hand and embrace it in another way
9097025 let them know that you understand the reasons why kids like to drink but teach them the difference between drinking and binge drinking and be prepared to answer questions about your own drinking behavior
9097026 if others around you are drinking just a little you can bring it down
9097027 we dont lecture we say that drinking is like driving it can be dangerous its a skill you have to learn how it works
9097028 make sure there are other things to do like arts or volunteer efforts
9097029 even in a heavily drinking college there are places where there is less drinking
9097030 all families experience stress but poor families experience a lot of it
9097031 growing up in a socially disadvantaged environment often exposes people to threats to their health and well being
9097032 many good schools have shown they can create experiences that change the brain for the better
9097033 behaviors and thoughts that relate to hope love and happiness can change the brain just as fear stress and anxiety can change it
9097034 when people are experiencing strong stress they recover much better when they have social support than when they are socially isolated
9097035 exercise stimulates and energizes the brain to more efficiently process information exercise actually makes more brain cells
9097036 be sure youre getting good sources of protein and calcium each day eat an egg or egg whites a glass of milk and take a multivitamin

9097038 video games are enjoyed by young and old however the internet magazines and more are replete with untruths about gaming the world is replete with things like gaming leads to violence gaming ruins the eyesight kids who get involved with video games become school drop outs or fall into bad company and more

9097040 the issue comes down to this does he really think hes guilty of something he says no and if hes going to fight whatever charges this shows it

9097081 picked up one of the city guide books put out by the san diego convention and visitors bureau there is a coupon in that book for the go san diego cards
9097082 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9097083 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9097084 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9097085 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9097086 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9097087 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9097088 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9097089 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9097090 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9097091 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9097092 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9097093 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9097094 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9097095 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9097096 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9097097 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9097098 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9097099 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9097100 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9097101 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9097102 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9097103 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9097104 my fellow americans come join our cause join our cause and help our country to elect a great man the next president of the united states and i thank you and i god bless you i say and god bless america thank you
9097105 you know governor palin has more executive experience than senator obama senator biden and senator schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9097106 there were several women spoken about as possible vice presidential candidates kay bailey hutchinson from texas meg whitman from ebay carly fiorina why governor palin
9097107 shes a chief executive of a state shes a governor former mayor of a city in alaska shes been a businesswoman she helped her husband run the family fishing business shes a mom of five and shes a reformer shes not a washington insider shes been a reformist governor and very strongly supported in alaska
9097108 you know governor palin has more executive experience than senator obama senator biden and senator schumer combined because those guys have never run anything so i find that quite amusing
9097109 i was very disappointed with senator obamas choice of a running mate he chose somebody else whos a washington insider from the east coast who knows nothing about the west and senator mccain surely does im also very pleased that hes chosen as his vice president the chief executive of the oil producing state in america strong energy credentials and the energy issue is very important to americans

9097127 tragically as the men were being transported to iraq a car containing twelve of the men was stopped by members of the ansar al sunna army an insurgent group
9097128 the 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents the executions were filmed and posted on the internet the inspector general for the united states department of defense investigated and confirmed the facts related to the fate of the 12 men which led to increased enforcement of anti trafficking measures by the united states
9097129 ivins performed research that required exposing research animals to airborne anthrax according to a 1998 report in the journal vaccine the goal was to test whether a new vaccine could guard against anthrax inhaled in a bioterrorist attack

9097134 the main thing is to get the comfort level of whether weve got the capacity to handle a contagious disease like that and contain it before it spreads
9097135 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
9097136 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims

9097146 sadly the 2007 walter reed scandal which resulted mostly from poor oversight and inadequate leadership pales in comparison to what we view as the deliberate manipulation of the law

9097161 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
9097162 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
9097163 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars
9097164 after the yamanya incident we organized large public gatherings and asked people to help us find the suspects we also said we would offer a 50 000 yuan reward to anyone who helped but still nobody has come forward

9097169 he said he crawled into the front seat and let himself out
9097170 initially we did not know that he got into a cab
9097171 we didnt know that for an hour we believed he was hiding under a vehicle in the mall parking lot or something
9097172 i didnt know if this guy was going to put handcuffs around my neck and strangle me
9097173 i didnt know if he had a weapon once he showed me the cuffs my training kicked in we are taught to do exactly what they say

9097175 but they would not take the time to talk to me
9097176 ese es uno de los motivos que tenemos todos intentar ganar el partido contra monterrey y sacar los nueve puntos de la semana porque viene un periodo de receso en la que vamos a tratar de trabajar para mejorar muchas cosas porque despu s ya no vamos a tener tiempo
9097177 se ha creado un cl sico muy importante que nos llega a nosotros pero m s que nada debemos ganar por nosotros mismos y es una bonita prueba para seguir mejorando y creciendo ante un rival dif cil que juega bien el futbol

9097246 marks been there and done that and i dont nerves will play any part in it
9097247 considering the squad that weve had for both of our opening games with a wee bit of luck we could have won both games and could be sitting top of the a league
9097248 there have been a lot of positives to come out of both games young defender pedj bojic has been outstanding nigel boogaard is back now matt simon is back and doing well sasho petrovski is doing well and adrian caceres and ahmad elrich are getting better with every game
9097249 jedinak and macallister will be up for selection on sunday itll take us about two or three weeks for our squad to get bigger which puts more pressure on players to perform which is what its all about
9097250 like everyone else we wont to get a win on the board
9097251 were travelling alright and after two games were only two points off top spot
9097252 in a game like this the onus is on us to create and force the play
9097253 in the first half i thought we were a little impatient in that regard we got that early goal and then lost focus a little bit we did a better job in the second half and did well to finish some chances
9097254 for as many shots and as much possession that we had we needed to do a better job of finishing off a game
9097255 it was still 1 0 in the 60th minute and they were still in it meghan did a great job in the second half in finishing some good goals

9097292 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9097293 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9097294 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief
9097295 by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9097296 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9097297 in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling pushed for more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming her most recent effort has been to sue the u s fish and wildlife service to remove the polar bear from the endangered species list putting big oil before sound science as unbelievable as this may sound this actually puts her to the right of the bush administration
9097298 of the hundreds of governors senators congressmen and business leaders available to you do you really think that a 44 year old person who has two years experience as governor of a thinly populated state is the best person in the country to be president of the united states after yourself

9097311 instead of submitting any evidence if any such evidence actually exists in compliance with the applicable rules and the commissions prior orders appellant filed a one paragraph statement alleging nothing more that a bald statement that she and the community would be adversely impacted this bald statement is a far cry from the evidence required to establish standing at a minimum appellant must show a direct and present injury which is not borne by the population in general but that specifically affects the appellant and must satisfy the showing required by the bicking three prong test for associational standing
9097312 the kind of evidence that answers those questions easily can be and in fact should have been presented through written documents and perhaps affidavits

9097338 we note that the pastoral forum proposal has been developed without any consultation with those most directly affected in north america
9097339 we would also observe that the various analogies offered for example that we are disaffected children being reunited with our parents or that we are being placed in a holding bay before being restored to our proper province are both demeaning and unacceptable
9097340 we can envision no way in which we could be part of pastoral forum in which either church exercises any leadership role

9097353 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9097354 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9097355 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9097356 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9097357 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9097358 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9097359 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers

9097362 we are working on revisions to the plan of reorganization that would let the company successfully emerge
9097363 our point all along has been that everyone realizes that liquidation doesnt serve the workers or the creditors of delphi and in liquidation the pbgcs claim would swamp most other creditors
9097364 we want to make sure that delphi and its pension plans remain intact the best way to avoid liquidation is for gm to take delphis pension liabilities and thats why we have been advocating so forcefully for that result

9097394 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9097395 i would say to the democrats regarding sexism tag youre it
9097396 everyone likes to say you are sexist if you dont vote for hillary clinton but what about all the women who are not going to vote for sarah palin
9097397 this is someone who is already known for puffery and verbosity
9097398 and we will be looking out for the sexist treatment of gov palin
9097399 shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second

9097427 there is going to be no let up in hunting down those who have to face the consequence of the law but the forces on the ground will definitely exercise great sensitivity to the observance of ramadan the government will not allow those who are object of this manhunt to hide behind ramadan to escape liability before the law

9097459 not only does it raise the likelihood of a mother having a pre term baby who are already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases those infants susceptibility to sids even further
9097460 we also know that the smoke exposed babies or fetuses when they become children they also have developmental and behavioural problems
9097461 i think the more information thats out the better and we can only hope that people take that information and use it to the best that they can
9097462 only about 10 per cent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 per cent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9097463 if you want to achieve excellence you can get there today as of this second quit doing less than excellent work
9097464 the guy went through and the horn blew the guy hesitated as he looked down the tracks and the train hit him and dragged him like three blocks down
9097465 i was like that guys dead because the car wrapped around the front of the engine and just pushed him
9097466 it was really scary somebody was watching over him thats all i got to say
9097467 i like hillary in part because shes got bill and hes great
9097468 you know speaking as a private citizen sarah palin is not qualified to be my president shes not ready to run this country
9097469 a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it work again
9097470 understands the problems the hopes the values of working people
9097471 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9097472 zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9097473 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9097474 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9097475 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9097476 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9097477 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9097478 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9097479 at this point in my career id prefer to have kerry collins playing for us to be honest with you
9097480 i dont have the luxury of time of sitting for two or three years until someone figures it out and i think is a great quarterback a phenomenal talent just like his brother but it took his brother a few years to figure it out before he became the best in the game
9097481 weve got one more test and hopefully thatll be the last one before we can get into a game
9097482 what were going to do were going to see how he does facing the hitters the one thing that weve done is we have not rushed this and we have not tried to get ahead of ourselves and we wont do that but after saturdays performance well make an evaluation to see if the next step is he needs more time or possibly we can activate him or whatever we need to do
9097483 well we couldnt necessarily bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away just because hes not built up
9097484 thats something that well continue to talk about and see how he feels
9097485 if it takes him a while to bounce back from 35 pitches maybe we go one direction if hes able to bounce back quickly after 35 pitches maybe we go a different direction were just going to do whats in the best interest of his health and the club
9097486 i dont have any doubts that its the right decision
9097487 now maybe there will be some little kinks in it early on possibly but to me its the right decision and im actually all in favor of it it may take a little bit longer in the beginning than we want but im sure itll get ironed out and eventually itll go really quickly
9097488 incluso al momento en que caminaba por el escenario mientras se entregaban carteles de obama la gente se quedaba pensando qu es esto
9097489 they didnt get down on themselves they get down 14 0 nothing they continued to play they knew it was a fourth quarter ball game we preach that every day
9097490 were a fast tempo offense our objective is to get them tired and we made some big plays on that
9097491 when i was traded from san jose theres no doubt that i wanted to stick it to them when i played against them thats just human nature
9097492 so we expect nick and scott to be fired up and ready to go tonight and to make sure their new teammates understand how important this game is for them
9097493 i consider him one of the better defenders in the league
9097494 yeah yeah i mean thats probably in the back of my mind but im not going to go out there and try to do everything on my own
9097495 thats not a game plan were going to stick to what weve been doing im going to do what has been successful for us in the past few weeks
9097496 i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference

9097512 the american kennel club akc announced today that the public has elected a poodle as their breed of choice for the obama family
9097513 this was embargoed until 4 hours from now and i would have appreciated it if you could have respected that

9097515 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9097516 opposes gay marriage constitutionally banned in alaska before her time but exercised a veto that essentially granted benefits to gay state employees and their partners
9097517 the governors veto does not signal any change or modification to her disagreement with the action and order by the alaska supreme court
9097518 its unconstitutional to require a couple to be married in order to get government employment benefits
9097519 supreme court unanimously rule d in october 2005 its unconstitutional to deny benefits to the same sex partners of public employees
9097520 anchorage officials begin steps to offer benefits state says it needs more time supreme court eventually gives until jan 1 2007 for state to comply with the ruling
9097521 act prohibiting the commissioner of administration from adopting allowing become law or implementing regulations that grant or extend employment related benefits to same sex partners of state employees and members of the state retirement systems unless expressly authorized by statute
9097522 the department of law advised me that this bill hb4001 is unconstitutional given the recent court order of december 19th mandating same sex benefits
9097523 the department of law advised me that this bill hb4001 is unconstitutional given the recent court order of december 19th mandating same sex benefits
9097524 with that in mind signing this bill would be in direct violation of my oath of office
9097525 the bill effectively eliminated the regulatory process as a way to comply with the courts order to provide same sex domestic partner benefits for state employees and members of state retirement systems
9097526 legally sufficient to authorize the commission of administration to expand state employee health benefits or change the retirement systems to provide benefits for same sex domestic partners
9097527 the supreme court has ordered adoption of the regulations by the state of alaska to begin providing benefits january 1
9097528 we have no more judicial options we may disagree with the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and follow the constitution
9097529 i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman but the supreme court has spoken and the state will abide
9097530 the alaska supreme court ruled the state couldnt deny spousal
9097531 e lected officials cant defy the court when it comes to how rights are applied she said but she would support a ballot question that would deny benefits to homosexual couples i believe that honoring the family structure is that important palin said she said she doesnt know if people choose to be gay
9097532 palin said that when voters approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman eight years ago many believed they were also implying that a gay partner shouldnt get state benefits i wouldnt oppose at all the voters going back to the ballot box to clarify that she said during a ktuu channel 2 debate sunday
9097533 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9097534 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9097535 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources

9097542 it was great to see two of our really young athletes go out and run strong today it was impressive how laura was out to take control and go for the win
9097543 when i wear western clothes men stare at me objectify me or i am always measuring myself against the standards of models in magazines which are hard to live up to and even harder as you get older not to mention how tiring it can be to be on display all the time when i wear my headscarf or chador people relate to me as an individual not an object i feel respected
9097544 gop members writing their platform today voted to support jerusalem as the undivided capital of israel and backed the moving of the unites states embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem
9097545 that game was what we needed after a tough loss to illinois
9097546 we needed to see how tough we were and did playing a team like auburn who gave us all we could handle

9097558 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet meanwhile john mccain s wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a edifice and dragged her backwards to his cave
9097559 the nights bounteous event was obama s speech in front of 75 000 enthusiastic supporters and eight potty broncos flavour ticket holders
9097560 john mccain has voted with george dubya 90 proportionality of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it feature about your judgment when you think george dubya has been correct more than 90 proportionality of the time i dont know about you but im not primed to take a 10 proportionality quantity on change
9097561 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify byzantine issues has had difficulty delegating authority and understandably has difficulty distinguishing the line between her open responsibilities and clannish wishes
9097562 her support ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 proportionality earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as intimately as most reporters or legislators if you took a enquiry of reporters and legislators i expect her support judgement would be down in the teens or twenties
9097563 it would be a land clew from the mccain crusade that they were going to be making a very strong effort for the women whom they wager up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who rest disillusioned

9097569 okay now that were clear of the dmz and have meslers barge dropped off we wont need them right away
9097570 wouldve been nice to have the long range sensors in the dmz though wed have seen that cardassian ship before we almost knocked on their door
9097571 one of these days i have to get back on a clock
9097572 too bad we cant keep him hes quick good guy
9097573 and some fresh deuterium to help stabilize the input ratio
9097574 as for the rest i can tune it but with that force fed dilithium itll never be right
9097575 costs a lot to get a hand on the good stuff these days out here
9097576 but im telling you what well need to get it latinum which were short on for a few more runs
9097577 well then well just have to find another way around it in the interim
9097578 you also shouldnt be running an engine on that little drive plasma youll never get the pressure up to spec
9097579 you need to keep the compression levels between eight point four and nine point three to get any kind of efficiency out of this kind of impulse generator
9097580 we can shape this up without new parts just some tuning even if a replacement here and there wouldnt hurt and speaking of replacements how does the crew feel about that bolian mainframe
9097581 i wont have to tell you once i find the central core if thats okay with everyone
9097582 you can fix that when we can afford to commit extra power to something that does its job well enough already
9097583 we save the good food for stationside let the ship systems use the power instead trust me they burn it up easily enough
9097584 not if you dont plan to eat the plate too
9097585 youd better be youd drive a tursk widow to the poorhouse if she was half as generous as youre thirsty
9097586 we never get strip for strip there and the quality doesnt show for it
9097587 shouldnt be a problem there watch those ferengi this time though no dabo girls
9097588 what about you savan and maryl already have our deal contracted so you only need to press your thumb to the padds have any plans yet
9097589 actually i was thinking about checking out those upgraded holosuites they sound like something i could work with
9097590 that and i have to check up with some contacts see about some supplies maybe hunt some more for a navigational relay assembly
9097591 pure luck besides youll never find a navigational node good enough for you and even if you did youd never get it to work the way you want it to accept it
9097592 ive had to accept a lot with the guerdon but there are some things i wont ill upgrade that system one of these days if it kills me
9097593 and ever since he got the guerdon hes wanted to make it do things itll never do like go warp nine point five and maneuver like a squadron fighter
9097594 but hed have to knock off the best of starfleet to get it and thats definitely not going to happen
9097595 id also like to check out the rcs before you get to podala
9097596 from what i could see theyre better than i expected considering how the rest of the impulse drive is tied together
9097597 and an all night poker game a couple months ago but then we had to get new thrusters or go straight to warp from the station they were shot
9097598 this is all the break i need i dont tire easily
9097599 hana and i need some rest but savan can show you cant you savan

9097645 tom were getting a transmission from the kimoa salvage station
9097646 were towing the salvage of a medium barge in to you for trade the hull is complete except for disruptor damage on the mid below deck and is still has half its original components including the nacelles and warp matrices
9097647 were five hours away would you like me to transmit the parts and suggested price list to you
9097648 tom to this day i dont know how you do that straight faced
9097649 im getting some dinner ill be in engineering with ridge after that working on those shield matrices
9097650 ridge says they check out well be installing the housings tomorrow if we get them refitted all right
9097651 cancel and tell me how long its been in federation standard since i last deactivated the lights
9097652 what i wouldnt give for an automated defuser wrench right now
9097653 savan get ready to magnetize the grid just about there tom just another few seconds
9097654 the generator is operating shields are at one hundred percent
9097655 not a problem i was expecting youd find your way down eventually
9097656 welcome to hell and since youre checking the place out let me introduce you to ridge our lead technician
9097657 we had to trade it off a couple months ago for some deuterium ill get a hold of another soon enough for now weve got the next best thing
9097658 its good to see you up and around and good to meet you belanna
9097659 really you dont need to worry about tom hes an all right guy
9097660 its not that i just thought i remembered him from somewhere
9097661 well weve all been around the circuit for a while you probably crossed paths at one of the stations
9097662 all i know is that he doesnt know you since hed have said so by now at least to me
9097663 so lets get you acquainted with what we affectionately call an engine room
9097664 my wife tells me youre looking at the job we have open
9097665 it doesnt like the intermix ratio we use to manage warp eight
9097666 yeah believe that tops at warp eight outside the border of course one of toms personal buys that reactor frankly i think he had something on captain coliras cause he never did admit what he paid in the end and i happen to know how much he spends for his personal supplies in any case we got it unfortunately we only got the reactor which means the bolian injectors are constantly trying to merge with vulcan initiators funny as that sounds
9097667 give me a laser wrench i didnt bring my tools with me this time
9097668 you said youd give me a tour this is it get me a laser wrench
9097669 i hope you dont mind my taking the hull for scrap
9097670 for that matter you still have some latinum coming to you
9097671 to be honest im glad we were able to work out our mutual problem i think were all getting as much as we can with this arrangement its good to know we can be reasonable in spite of our different priorities
9097672 i was told your technician carried a body out of one of the holds
9097673 one of my people was injured while investigating the forward compartments
9097674 they said she was bad off dirty compared to the rest of your crew
9097675 cant expect much different from a determined engineer especially on this ship
9097676 just got too far into a dark hold knocked over some containers and hurt her knee bumped her head i havent heard the whole story yet luckily my science analyst did some time in medical school im lucky to have her
9097677 the colonies see a lot of action these days youve got lots of reasons to need one
9097678 it was good doing business with you captain i hope we have the chance to deal with each other again
9097679 thanks for making this as easy as it was i wasnt expecting it
9097680 maryl get us the hell out of here warp whatever you want
9097681 so i think were safe well be at the kimoa station in nine hours to drop off meslers bucket ill be getting a short rest if nobody minds
9097682 they were asking about her condition theyd seen you and ridge the captain probably wanted to see if she had any information on him or his ship
9097683 it is unlikely she did the records from the database jerod uploaded suggests she was relatively new and not in meslers circle
9097684 yeah well i didnt think she looked like the type i know appearances and all but she didnt strike me as anything more than a hire
9097685 indeed her klingon physiology was helpful as was her relatively good health
9097686 she has had prolonged exposure to dichromide gas likely from meslers ship where we found notable leaks and traces of the raw element in their holds i have treated the cellular damage successfully
9097687 your globulin treatment is nearly completed but your knee still undergoes regeneration
9097688 its captain and crew aside from yourself have been killed with none other but my crew and the maquis crew holding interest in recovering their losses captain meslers debts to us
9097689 the only logical course of action is to take the hull to those who might make use of it
9097690 your personal belongings have been collected as has much of the work you put into your assignment
9097691 you have been given lodging in a former colleagues quarters for the duration of your stay
9097692 can you also tell me where ive ended up this time
9097693 with meslers old barge weve gotten everything we could from it this divided with the maquis group like savan said its no good to anyone anymore and mesler did owe us our cargo which wasnt there he let his license go null a few years ago but we did have formal agreement so bolarus gave us permission to scrap it which we would have anyway its barely a repayment but itll have to do were on our way to podala with a stop at the kimoa range to drop the rig off
9097694 it only seems fair since youre the one out of a job and not getting your pay from mesler any time soon
9097695 this ship works like a cooperative our licenses and the ships registry are maintained on bolarus but our actual business and route is unaffiliated with any organizations or federations so we control how the moneys are distributed we split all earnings evenly among the crew with a double share put into the pot for parts and supplies but mesler owed you too and so you get one share like everyone else
9097696 youre our guest so make yourself at home while youre here
9097697 theyre yours for as long as you need them to be i know youre out of a job pretty suddenly and id like to help if maybe theres a station you want to be dropped off at or whatever
9097698 well im out of a job can you help with that
9097699 as a matter of fact we could use another set of hands in the engine room but i dont want you to jump right into that idea and ill be the last to sell you to it be the guest for now check things out see how you feel about it
9097700 just because i was working on that piece of crap doesnt mean i couldnt have gotten anything else
9097701 hell the fact that it was still moving tells me that much
9097702 fine have ridge take you down to the engine room when youre up to it but dont feel obligated to anything theres plenty of time for making decisions
9097703 let her get some rest maryl when shes ready to go to quarters ill be doing the same soon after i drop this off
9097704 hes lying badly as usual were desperate for an engineer he just wont go so far as to beg or grab the first person available he also wants to know youre not just talk in spite of what we found in meslers engine room couldve been the person before you that did all that work for all we know
9097705 and i wouldnt mind proving it if it meant i could pick up another job without passing through the station system
9097706 if youd take a contract on meslers barge its no question youre in it for the work
9097707 since hes the owner of this ship and the official captain like the title or not tom is the final say on who gets hired here and who doesnt so youre going to have to play it by his suggestion
9097708 if you stay youll learn pretty quickly that hes the most indirect when he really wants something hard lesson learned when he first came on board which we all paid for dearly since he managed to scrape us out of that mess he doesnt give away his hand until hes ready to even if youre screaming in his face which actually makes him worse that said i dont think hed have told you anything if he wasnt interested
9097709 you say youre desperate for an engineer but you seem willing to share the dirt on the captain whats the deal
9097710 is that if youre thinking about taking a position on this ship you need to know what youre dealing with as for dirt i can tell you hes fair to a fault flies the ship well and hes usually not an but hes got his share of problems and he does his best to drown them with whatevers available on the open market hes a highly functional drunk though so if you just accept it for what it is he wont bother you
9097711 maybe maybe not but the last thing we need is to lose another person because they cant handle it and need to drive everyone else crazy in the meantime
9097712 i dont give up on my contracts just because things get dicey whether its because of a person or whatever piece of crap i have to work on when i make an agreement i stick to it
9097713 anyone that could deal with mesler for more than a two way mission is honorable to the core
9097714 well the plus side was that they usually left me alone otherwise
9097715 just let me do my job leave me alone when i ask and i wont have any issues that anyone else has to deal with if thats all right with everyone here ill fit
9097716 i think you and i will get along just fine
9097717 if the pain is manageable you may leave now as your blood loss was extensive and you are yet anemic from this and other chemical imbalances caused by your former environment i suggest you rest allow my treatments time to complete keep the regenerator on your leg i will examine you again tomorrow to assure your recovery is continuing well
9097718 well never make our deadline where is our warp drive torres
9097719 check the cargo scan for weapons materials look for any surviving crew and dispose of them
9097720 got it yeah thats meslers cruddy warp signature all right time to pay up ol buddy we got you
9097721 can you put the barge onscreen mesler wouldnt have stopped without a reason
9097722 i might if i reconnect hold on a sec yeah that should do
9097723 i see it this is turning out to be a interesting game of tag theyre locals
9097724 no lets hold up a bit see what theyre up to first before we give up that was an interesting move i didnt know people pulled kresjii maneuvers anymore
9097725 should have known he couldnt keep this jug strung well enough to finish the job
9097726 somethings held it together long enough to get it this far though
9097727 well theres nothing we can do for him now might as well get whats ours
9097728 not that i can see these crates are still packed in i dont think our heavy parts were here in the first place though no i think those other visitors distracted them in time
9097729 think we should grab it all then before that other ship comes back
9097730 im not about to make any enemies but we can finish meslers job if that other ship isnt already looking for their share i dont want any more trouble than weve got already
9097731 lets get to work and get savan down here to look at these holds tell us where theyre from you get on the circuits back there get the computer up before either one of those ships come back upload the crew records and dump us from the mainframe use what you need to do it quick and dirty if you have to
9097732 weve got some medicines in stock and someone who knows how to use them
9097733 if necessary we can find a doctor youll be okay
9097734 jerod asked me to inform you that the cardassians have left the area and that the tag team has returned alone
9097735 my point remains she will be unable to climb out of the hold
9097736 i guess it was too much to hope meslers were any more useful ill send ridge to carry her up
9097737 i think youre too interested in this storeroom for someone whos already found their part of the cargo
9097738 we came because mesler was late and we were nearby just like you i guess
9097739 you think were stupid enough to take on the cardassians youve got
9097740 ill take care of this do me a favor and trade off with ridge i need his hands for a minute savan needs help
9097741 the captain will take care of the situation you are safe with us
9097742 you have a concussion several lacerations two broken ribs and a fractured knee
9097743 you have lost a notable amount of blood you will require more than i can treat here but will on our ship please remain still
9097744 and i would recommend silence allow our captain to deal with the other crew as he is best able more not exerting yourself further will assist in your recovery
9097745 this does not surprise me however it would be the wiser thing for you to do
9097746 i get the feeling were sharing space for our purchases
9097747 actually the cargo is mostly yours ours are barely here from what i can see id like to see if theres anything else though
9097748 you might already know why that could make my people uncomfortable
9097749 the easiest one you get yours well get ours and the salvage of the ship if you dont mind and well be on our way good enough
9097750 he owed a portion of a profit we helped him to last time we came through here its why we decided to catch up with him but i think we can make up for some of it with some key parts from the ship granted any of it works
9097751 id like it if we could discuss some of those systems
9097752 i happen to be in need of a memory core
9097753 yeah im sure you could use it and keep it out of anyone elses hands im not going to want it so we dont even have to make that deal the last thing i need is a point inspection to turn up anything in a spare memory core thatd implicate my crew the federation is getting paranoid enough that theyd look for it
9097754 i take it you havent been around zero zero one in a while well ill admit i havent either but certain factions are making themselves pretty well known and making starfleet nervous as youve probably noticed word is they might start doing something about it
9097755 let me know if my crew can help you in any way while were all here
9097756 my ship doesnt deal in the sort of cargo the mesler was willing to but were not blind to whats going on either were careful but we get by all right
9097757 i dont want to insult you captain but judging by the look of your ship youre just doing that
9097758 we could also land ourselves in a federation penal resort according to the new treaty which is the last thing ill let happen to myself or my crew therere plenty of other traders in this area willing to make deals inside the region i think you should assess the conditions of their ships before looking at mine much as it might want for better
9097759 im glad you do so why dont we check our stores and see how much mesler cheated us
9097760 you know the look of my ship well enough and youve probably scanned it to dust already and ill know you in a crowd thats more than enough for me
9097761 wish theyd find someone their own size to pick on leave us alone
9097762 see if shes got any personal belongings a bunk or anything
9097763 tell me you like it doggie style or with your wrists tied to the girders
9097764 much as you seem to enjoy cardassian booty i dont think you or your captain would appreciate the federation crawling up your for knocking off a registered tradeship in what should have been neutral territory when youre supposedly defending some colonies no one seems to agree on do your job and take your fight back where it belongs
9097765 maryl you have our docking at podala worked out yet
9097766 i havent been able to patch in again since we got in this mess
9097767 and i havent gotten a reply yet youll know when i do
9097768 ridge care to come down to share the grease in meslers bucket
9097769 ill be there in two minutes though ill still wish it were the grease at the bottom of a bowl of fried oysters have i told you recently how delicious they were
9097770 and cute as hell to boot be down in a bit
9097771 where did all the cars go asked andrea chacon of san jose who with her family was driving over pacheco pass at the same time that i was on their way to bass lake near yosemite it was wonderful we were amazed

9097773 we almost turned around and did it twice just for fun
9097774 who would have thought the friday of labor day weekend at 1 p

9097777 aloha stippy special help us get this persons camera back to them
9097778 its great to see some innovative new plastics being released
9097779 another ideal method for their use has been to hook them on a 2 0 hook paternoster style rig in the same way as surf poppers in place of a second bait when targeting salmon and tailor etc
9097780 its like doing a jigsaw to create a dieng information system
9097781 so far dieng has remained a site of mystery with very little scientific data available amid numerous myths circulating in society
9097782 this highland can be a special place for honeymooners dieng only lacks promotion so it is less familiar to people from other regions
9097783 we are now regularly replanting the forest to restore the natural harmony of dieng

9097786 this was the final stage in a complicated process to help get residents into their homes as soon as possible and into a safe environment
9097787 the city will continue to provide necessary accommodation and services to residents as they make the transition back to their homes this coming week
9097788 i want to thank secord residents for their tremendous patience and strength as they have gone through this ordeal
9097789 because it rained during practice we used the qualifying as a test for our set up
9097790 it wasnt perfect but now we know what we need to change for the race
9097791 those were my first laps on slicks this weekend under these circumstances we did the best we could
9097792 i have to thank my team they found a great set up in a very short time that was not easy because it had rained during practice and as a result we couldnt turn any laps on a dry track but such a city circuit suits me you have to be precise at the limit and not make one mistake
9097793 barack obama s big convention speech was held in the same stadium where the denver broncos play football
9097794 and now the main stream media will no longer refer to
9097795 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9097796 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9097797 heading into qualifying we hadnt driven in the dry at all because it rained during both of the practice sessions today last year i didnt have much track time here so i was a bit of a newbie going into qualifying in dry conditions even though it was so wet this morning and we didnt run even one lap on slick non rain tires somehow the crew found a good setup for the dry and we were pretty much where we wanted to be in the beginning of the session it took a while to get the tire pressures up the crew called me into the pits but i knew that i hadnt pushed as hard as i could and that i could go quicker i was able to go out one last time there were four minutes left and i pushed hard after one lap i thought i had it but then the no 71 and then the no 62 both beat that time then on the final lap i pushed again and was able to take the pole
9097798 we expect that higher fuel prices may be a relative advantage for us
9097799 even driving 10 miles these days is a few dollars of gas
9097800 we expect that higher fuel prices may be a relative advantage for us
9097801 even driving 10 miles these days is a few dollars of gasoline
9097802 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement
9097803 isaiah raise your arm over your head no the other one

9097811 clock for the white devil who finds whom you out is and to you go can
9097812 but what i believe is that we have to work together to find out what the facts are before we make public announcements
9097813 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad
9097814 this can include but it is not limited to magazines three ring binders and other office supplies file cabinets fabric mat board and foam core
9097815 as a chinese i really got very excited last night it was beyond my imagination from the very beginning i could tell its about china not propaganda we he and friends who watched the ceremony together cheered from the deepest part of our hearts
9097816 its more than a sporting event its a party for the world and china is the host and we want people around the world to see what china is like now
9097817 really its almost a post graduate project collections can be so broad and complicated so it was very interesting to me to watch the process unfold and see how we could actually talk about collections
9097818 i thought it to be simple i know what collecting is
9097819 it was great to bring these guys in and watch them fire questions at the burnets why this
9097820 philippe really made it clear that the key element to any working group is to function democratically
9097821 we started exploring collecting ideas versus objects multiple kinds of objects or a single type of object
9097822 and it was like a lead balloon totally silent and i realized it was really a live situation there was an out and they didnt take it
9097823 and we wanted to represent the corruption of that truth
9097824 for teen issues but even at my age too its that the worlds not what they told us it would be and we must reconcile expectation with experience
9097825 but the project provided me with a more realistic perspective of art collections and collectors
9097826 talking about collections in this group was a passionate base for discussion
9097827 ive been a fireman for more than 30 years and there is something very special and unique about the relationship of firemen they live together eat together and sleep together just like family members i just dont believe mixing the races works in this case
9097828 were a bar for alternative subversive and counterculture clientele the actual intention of pi is to be a place for all people who are subversive or progressive in some way not only lesbian or gay
9097829 this carnival will be a jumping off point making a statement reflecting who we are im dismayed in some ways with the seeming lack of momentum of social justice movements we need to reinvigorate the counterculture movement and thats why pi is here we are good at bringing people together its a magical place here worlds collide
9097830 if you dont talk to them youll never get to know them
9097831 politically adults tend to call names and not discuss problems but children tend to ask the question
9097832 kids dont know other kids are homeless its sobering to a 12 year old when confronted with issues of homelessness the general public never meets people who are homeless only those like themselves through this experience next time folks are faced with the issue they will have new perspective
9097833 this is an opportunity to sit and meet with folks youve never met and exchange ideas
9097834 are you willing to fundamentally understand that were here to take care of one another
9097835 were here to give to the children of homeless families to make it memorable for their trip to st
9097836 you dont have to be liberal or conservative just bring a meal and talk
9097837 even though some delegates wont pay any attention to what the demonstrators are talking about its not a deterrent there will be massive media intensely focused on st paul
9097838 the plight of homelessness is almost off the radar screen in terms of media coverage these days with the foreclosure debt and housing crisis it should bring attention to the fact that homelessness is growing the factors that lead to homelessness are not being diminished
9097839 there are more homeless families now than ever before and we want people to be aware of that
9097840 this is a picnic where peoples eyes will be opened

9097844 in response to last weekends undeclared strike by some employees
9097845 we had a meeting thursday and we were told the newspaper is closed
9097846 the way things are now the union is firm in its opinion and im firm in mine
9097847 every time they threatened to close it would pull back up again
9097848 i didnt want to say anything i didnt want to make a big deal of something that was supposed to be happening
9097849 i bought a piece of carpet that i can use for special time
9097850 its easy to drive a toy car on as a treat its not educational but more social
9097851 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
9097852 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9097853 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9097854 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9097855 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way

9097858 is to broaden the issues christians pay attention to and also to counter falsehoods or smears targeting senator obama the pac is sponsoring radio and television advertisements aimed specifically at christians mostly on christian radio in key swing states there are ads in religious publications as well
9097859 people like myself get a lot of attention when we talk about issues like abortion and family life but not when we talk about helping low income people
9097860 matthew 25 gives us the opportunity to try to get candidates to focus on these concerns
9097861 says he found his christian faith while working as a community organizer among low income people in a catholic sponsored program
9097862 as a pastor i know you can learn a lot about a mans character by the way he treats his family
9097863 it included the rev kirbyjon caldwell whos been close to president bush and who recently officiated at jenna bushs wedding in crawford texas
9097864 weve seen the domination of just a couple of issues surround the christian voice in politics
9097865 we wanted a christian voice that better reflected the gospel values missing from the landscape
9097866 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of the ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or eliminate that right
9097867 you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church
9097868 whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me

9097871 one day blueberry my adopted baby smurf was playing outside in a new set of smurf hat and pajamas i had bought him while he was climbing on a toy mushroom i had made from sculpey suddenly one of the pajama buttons popped off the tiny creature stared around in bewilderment feeling exposed below his soft round little tail but not quite able to figure out why let alone why i was laughing aloud
9097872 captain we have a containment breach in the aft section
9097873 today i met the caretaker from the blue moon nursery while taking a walk in the small towns park blueberry was sleeping peacefully in a little sling id made to carry him in
9097874 upon gaining access to the warehouse it became readily apparent that the smugglers were forewarned and had likely abandoned this base of operations in the middle of the night there were various partially empty bags of animal feed piled in one corner as well as a couple of empty cages a metal desks drawer opened to reveal an empty ampoule of animal tranquilizer we were going to tape the area off for later inspection when a faint noise drew my attention inside a wastebasket lying on top of a pile of dirty rags was what appeared to be a tiny blue humanoid creatures head i thought back to a recent training seminar and wondered if what i was looking at was the seldom seen smurf remembering that these sentient lilliputians could speak i was about to address it but i realized at a second glance that this was an infant of the species a baby smurf what my daughter wouldnt give to be here right now she actually made me take the photos of baby smurfs from last years national geographic and blow them up to poster size for her room she even had the official life size which isnt very big at all baby smurf soft vinyl doll the proceeds of its purchase going to the preservation of the smurfs habitat worldwide the baby smurf before me wasnt in good shape however the noise i had heard had been its hoarse crying and sobbing looking up at me the creature was visibly terrified the diminutive blue beings body had bean tightly wrapped in rough sisal twine from chin to toe the wee little infant strained futilely against its bonds rocking back and forth between sobs i picked the creature up noting by the color of its trademark little hat that i was probably looking at the very rare except for baby smurfs female of the species the bewildered things face was a mask of terror as i scrutinized it with fascination the other agents had by now gathered around and there was nowhere the panicking baby smurf could turn without seeing a human face i started to unwrap the twine and when id finished the poor little creature was naked except for its little hat i had guessed right about the baby smurfs the tight rough sisal twine had gouged into the smurfs tender blue skin leaving its impression deep in the flesh the creature also exhibited signs of abuse miniscule bruises everywhere including on the unusual round little tail i gave the tail a curious gentle squeeze as the little blue biped squirmed in my grasp eliciting a frantic yelp of pain its pitiable appendage was still sore from being pinched by whomever the smurfs former tormentors had been its tail also exhibited the telltale puncture mark of a syringe the smugglers didnt seem to have considered this baby smurf of any value when they had fled which explained the rough treatment and the general disregard for its welfare it would take a couple of days to process the creature after that my department would alert the blue moon nursery this little blue creature may not realize it yet but things were going to change for the better its village was likely gone by now so life among philanthropic humans would be in its best interest
9097875 saturday was once again my turn to baby sit dewdrop it was raining so i decided to keep her and blueberry indoors i had filled a plastic cats litter box half full of corn meal and set the two diminutive blue infants inside
9097876 you see dewdrop youre okay and all nice and squeaky clean
9097877 sure shes got experience just not as much as i do
9097878 a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of midnight sun that left her possession and each was unique
9097879 in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
9097880 i am sad for her but angry at her at the same time
9097881 noooooooo can someone please call email stalk her and tell her she must write midnight sun how can this happen why leave us this way we can wait but why indefinately who the hell leaked it they should be flogged i think im gonna cry we just want to know what edward is thinking when he is in the meadow with bella and then when he stays at her house im gonna cry
9097882 its funny because when it first leaked everyone was really excited because so many of the fans who read it were really hyping it up and that it was really good
9097883 shell put it on hold long enough to create buzz when the buzz reaches fever pitch shell release it and make bank can you please find a new bs pitch the buzz creation tactic is old
9097884 although i am very upset with this news i can understand where stephenie meyer is coming from writing is an art whatever your mood is it is reflected in your work i am sorry that this has happened i hope that after taking some time to calm down and get past this betrayal she will feel differently this has been a whirlwind for her and everything has happened so fast she needs to take some time for herself and just enjoy herself we will be patient and wait for as long as it takes if midnight sun doesnt get released we should be grateful for everything she has done and given us is such a short time
9097885 she gave the manuscript to someone which means the leak started from her
9097886 oh shit we gotta make this sweatshirt asap and get it out
9097887 i saw the sign outside and i just had to see what it was all about
9097888 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9097889 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9097890 the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9097891 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9097892 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own

9097900 ive got a question for you is anyone here going to miss dick cheney
9097901 john mccain will pay hundreds of dollars for his own shoes but were the ones who have to pay for his flip flops
9097902 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9097903 john mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue the same policies over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9097904 republicans talk about putting country first but tell that to marion indiana they sent my job overseas

9097911 for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections from export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana and actaeon and diana and callisto might be sold

9097924 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job
9097925 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be president thats a debate id like to have
9097926 people think they can support him but hes a mystery inexperience is about not knowing him
9097927 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9097928 innovation in both business methodology and technology is capable of having profound effects on the degree that society adopts a truly green lifestyle and so we are excited to bring clean technology and innovation together at this years west coast green

9097931 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9097932 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9097933 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9097934 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9097935 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9097936 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9097937 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9097938 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9097939 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9097940 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9097941 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9097942 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9097943 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9097944 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9097945 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9097946 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9097947 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9097948 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9097949 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9097950 if you put a small value on yourself rest assure that the world will not raise your price
9097951 i wouldnt be here today without the staff and the surgeons at the alfred
9097952 i was standing near the wood heater when the can exploded
9097953 initially i only thought i had burnt my hands and arm
9097954 when i was told the condition i was in i actually thought i might never see my boys again
9097955 being as close as i am to my children and having lost my own father 10 years ago i know how lucky i am
9097956 i want to remind people how important the alfred is to victoria
9097957 how many people get transferred from bendigo to melbourne almost on a weekly basis whether its a car accident or a hand injury nine times out of 10 its to the alfred
9097958 i cant say i know authentic hummus but i do know delicious hummus
9097959 when you come to a fork in the road take it
9097960 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9097961 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9097962 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9097963 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9097964 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9097965 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9097966 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9097967 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9097968 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9097969 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9097970 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9097971 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9097972 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9097973 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9097974 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9097975 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9097976 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9097977 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9097978 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9097979 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9097980 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9097981 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9097982 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9097983 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9097984 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9097985 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9097986 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9097987 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9097988 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9097989 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9097990 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9097991 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9097992 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9097993 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9097994 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9097995 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9097996 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9097997 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9097998 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9097999 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9098000 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9098001 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9098002 ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country
9098003 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because janet reno is her father
9098004 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9098005 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9098006 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9098007 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9098008 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9098009 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9098010 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9098011 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9098012 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9098013 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9098014 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9098015 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9098016 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9098017 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9098018 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9098019 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9098020 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9098021 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9098022 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9098023 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9098024 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9098025 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9098026 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9098027 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9098028 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9098029 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9098030 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9098031 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9098032 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9098033 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9098034 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9098035 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9098036 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9098037 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
9098038 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
9098039 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9098040 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9098041 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9098042 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
9098043 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
9098044 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
9098045 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
9098046 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
9098047 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
9098048 its simple mom dont you try on your clothes before you buy them
9098049 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9098050 i have been asked to speak at the republican national convention on monday evening i view this as an honor and a rare opportunity to serve my country with the gift and message god has given me
9098051 character doing the right thing when no one is looking
9098052 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9098053 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9098054 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
9098055 hey lets open a restaurant with overpriced mediocre food ridiculous prices a bunch of potheads on staff and pathetic lunch specials that would be awesome
9098056 mm glorious combination of dirty taco bell chalupa and organic food
9098057 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to the mountain move mountain and it will move
9098058 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
9098059 now we know the things we need to work on which is good
9098060 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9098061 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9098062 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9098063 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
9098064 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
9098065 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
9098066 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
9098067 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
9098068 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
9098069 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9098070 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9098071 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9098072 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9098073 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9098074 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9098075 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9098076 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9098077 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9098078 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9098079 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9098080 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9098081 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9098082 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9098083 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9098084 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9098085 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9098086 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9098087 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9098088 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9098089 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9098090 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9098091 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9098092 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9098093 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9098094 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9098095 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9098096 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9098097 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9098098 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9098099 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9098100 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9098101 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9098102 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9098103 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9098104 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9098105 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9098106 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9098107 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9098108 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9098109 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9098110 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9098111 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9098112 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9098113 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9098114 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9098115 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9098116 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9098117 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9098118 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9098119 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9098120 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9098121 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9098122 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9098123 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9098124 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9098125 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9098126 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9098127 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9098128 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9098129 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9098130 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9098131 a different political standpoint im not a big war believer
9098132 he knows how good he is as a knife fighter
9098133 even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
9098134 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9098135 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9098136 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9098137 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9098138 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9098139 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9098140 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9098141 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9098142 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9098143 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9098144 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9098145 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9098146 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
9098147 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9098148 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9098149 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9098150 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9098151 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9098152 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9098153 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9098154 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9098155 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9098156 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9098157 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9098158 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9098159 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9098160 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9098161 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9098162 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9098163 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9098164 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9098165 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9098166 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9098167 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9098168 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9098169 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9098170 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9098171 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9098172 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9098173 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9098174 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9098175 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9098176 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9098177 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9098178 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9098179 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9098180 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9098181 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9098182 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9098183 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9098184 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9098185 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9098186 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9098187 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9098188 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9098189 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9098190 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9098191 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9098192 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9098193 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9098194 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9098195 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9098196 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9098197 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9098198 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9098199 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9098200 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9098201 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9098202 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9098203 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9098204 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9098205 the only time i ever saw my mother really angry was when she saw cruelty
9098206 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9098207 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9098208 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9098209 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9098210 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9098211 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9098212 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9098213 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9098214 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9098215 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9098216 yeah i know thats why they call them morning glorys
9098217 maybe it was surprising that it went as quickly as it did initially but nonetheless it went according to the plan
9098218 belief in personal responsibility amp self reliance as well as belief in individuals responsibility for financial stability
9098219 i would take a look and study the successes or failures of fellow countries that have implemented a similar healthcare system to see how it affected their economy
9098220 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9098221 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9098222 stop digging up my corpse to start for the jets
9098223 ok well im just never going to do that again
9098224 since first being named the starter of the green bay packers before playing the pittsburgh steelers on september 27 1992 brett favre never missed a game
9098225 green bay didnt meet his price that doesnt mean he didnt have one though
9098226 the shame is that in the not so distant past favre was the pure guy the untouchable the great teammate who played for the love of the game now he shows up in training camp having spent the last few days contemplating how much it would have cost the packers to keep him retired green bay didnt meet his price
9098227 seven is too many for all of us to go in one night
9098228 one of us must have to go saturday or sunday or else they would say we are all in the final
9098229 this is the last saturday in the big brother house
9098230 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9098231 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9098232 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9098233 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9098234 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9098235 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9098236 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9098237 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9098238 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9098239 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9098240 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9098241 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9098242 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9098243 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9098244 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them
9098245 this oct 14 is the first day of the major jewish festival of sukkot an important holy day on our communitys calendar
9098246 an election on that day would have a very adverse impact on the jewish electorate as well as scrutineers drivers other campaign and elections canada volunteers
9098247 i want to emphasize the importance of that date as a holy day especially in light of the fact that we did send a note to the prime ministers office about it
9098248 would be inappropriate insensitive and disenfranchise parts of the jewish community
9098249 but we have large scale advance polls which are available
9098250 you can also go to a returning office any day during a writ period to cast a ballot
9098251 love him or hate him our prime minister knows where he stands on the issues and will offer canadians certainty
9098252 i have concluded that mr harper absolutely wants to go to an election
9098253 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9098254 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9098255 being in like minded company with people who support the cause
9098256 it was inspiring to see the mix of black and white old and young
9098257 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9098258 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9098259 they had their chance they have not led we will
9098260 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9098261 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9098262 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9098263 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9098264 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9098265 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that that election didnt matter
9098266 when he walks out on stage tonight in front of 75 000 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9098267 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9098268 it was a very close election and certainly for a lot of people at that time who said theres no difference between al gore and
9098269 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9098270 the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9098271 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
9098272 he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
9098273 gore compared obama to abe lincoln what a laugh abe was honest patriatic humble a great statesman obama is none of these obama is so very arrogant he reminds me of hitler
9098274 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9098275 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9098276 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9098277 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9098278 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9098279 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9098280 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9098281 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9098282 det var bara att duka fram penslar f rg och papper p k ksbordet
9098283 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9098284 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9098285 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9098286 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9098287 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
9098288 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9098289 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9098290 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
9098291 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9098292 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder forless
9098293 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9098294 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9098295 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9098296 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9098297 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
9098298 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9098299 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9098300 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9098301 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9098302 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9098303 the epidemics curve appears to show that we have not yet reached the end of the outbreak because there have still been recent cases
9098304 it is reasonable to believe that these products could pose a threat to public health
9098305 the company is offering its full co operation and is applying all appropriate measures to protect the health of consumers
9098306 approximately 80 per cent of offenders coming into the system have some type of substance abuse problem
9098307 it helps the gangs that develop in the system organized crime and the hierarchy develops
9098308 so for the first time in their life theres a possibility where they can actually be in a drug free environment and actually break free of addictions that ruin the lives of so many people
9098309 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9098310 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9098311 we want to see those enhanced but for those to be effective we have to stop the flow of drugs into the institution
9098312 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9098313 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9098314 people have been eating insects for a very long time
9098315 youre already eating bugs and theyre a great source of protein so why not try them
9098316 it didnt really taste like anything but it was crunchy
9098317 all it is is a cultural taboo and once they are eating this food theyll find it just like any other food
9098318 ive been seeing some articles saying that indigenous peoples in sub saharan africa are saying they dont do this in the u
9098319 we found in our research that crickets were five to six times more efficient in providing nutrients than beef cattle
9098320 each female cricket produces about 500 young crickets so you can see how efficient that is
9098321 if you can eat prawns and you can eat lamb and you can eat mutton im sure you can eat crickets as well prawns and lobster are pretty much the bugs of the oceans anyway
9098322 its the same as a vegetarian who doesnt want to eat mutton
9098323 if the situation gets worse we might have to rent out our new warehouses to other companies
9098324 were suffering a cold winter in the middle of summer
9098325 if youre sitting in beijing youre saying weve already lost two percentage points of economic growth
9098326 thats a big turning point for the chinese economy that means questions of profitability questions of unemployment questions of social stability
9098327 the chinese economy is still beset with problems including persistent prices rises uncertainties in demand abroad squeezed corporate profit margins difficulty in ensuring energy and power supplies and undue expansion of foreign exchanges reserves
9098328 for many of us its hard to raise our prices because the orders from our old clients are based on the earlier cheaper prices
9098329 some people say that the more they produce the more they lose money
9098330 were getting almost no profits from our overseas orders because of the rising cost of material labour and transportation
9098331 american clients are hesitating to send us orders because theyre afraid that they wont be able to sell the furniture and chinese exporters are reluctant to accept the orders because the profit margins are so low
9098332 but over the next several years and i dont know when its going to start the next leg is likely to be down and when the economy declines its not going to be a soft recession
9098333 this is when you discover how dysfunctional this economy was
9098334 with energy prices rising dramatically as a cost component the ability of the chinese economy to keep functioning the way it used to is in severe doubt
9098335 japan went south when non performing loans got to about 20 per cent of gdp south korea about 25 per cent
9098336 these guys chinese are conservatively at 40 per cent of gdp and then they get hit by commodity prices so for china its the perfect storm
9098337 is it going to grow at 12 per cent forever of course not
9098338 but it can grow at 6 to 10 per cent for the next five years most people would be happy with that especially as the base is getting bigger
9098339 we have to spend a lot of money on brand promotion and sales networks to develop the domestic market for our furniture
9098340 we dont have enough experience and expertise in the domestic market and about 50 to 60 per cent of the furniture factories in dalingshan have switched to the domestic market so were facing severe competition its a real headache for all of us here
9098341 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
9098342 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
9098343 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9098344 we are here because we want respect from the government
9098345 thats why weve massed in front of city hall to oppose the oppressive measures adopted by the government which effect not just buddhists but other minority religious groups as well
9098346 most of the high level appointments lee made were people from his church
9098347 the 2df galaxy redshift survey constraints on cosmic star formation history from the cosmic spectrum
9098348 beloved pets a couple years down the line because no one plans on being put in a position to have to make a choice like that
9098349 i got to read up and figure out who she is and where she stands mccains been out there but i have no idea who she is
9098350 i dont know much about her so i cant form an opinion yet but i thought it was an interesting move
9098351 i thought he was trying to pull a fast one trying to get the women that were in hillarys camp
9098352 we support giving creation science equal representation with other theories of the origin of life if evolution is taught it should be presented as only a theory
9098353 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9098354 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9098355 thought so anyway i got kicked in the stomach when i was pregnant with you the placenta partially detached you were starving to death if theyd waited any longer you would have died
9098356 you were so weak you stayed in the hospital for ten days and you couldnt suck so i had to use that special nipple i told you about that
9098357 oh thats genetic look at your dad and you had a grandmother who was barely five feet tall not even that
9098358 it says im naked in the middle of a magazine
9098359 so i have to learn things about things and stuff
9098360 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
9098361 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9098362 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
9098363 in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9098364 for those of us who stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial or who in the years that followed may have lost hope this movement and this moment is a testament to the power and vision of martin luther king jr
9098365 were all children of the dream and he is in all our hearts and minds
9098366 but not only that he is in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
9098367 who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps
9098368 marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
9098369 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9098370 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9098371 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9098372 the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
9098373 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
9098374 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
9098375 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9098376 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it
9098377 but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9098378 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9098379 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day senator mccain took office
9098380 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stopgap measure not a long term solution not even close
9098381 it is unfathomable to me as an american and a world citizen that anyone would vote for that man
9098382 he served his country and he did a good job as a serviceman i will honour him for that but he is not presidential material
9098383 a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it work again
9098384 understands the problems the hopes the values of working people
9098385 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9098386 zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9098387 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9098388 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9098389 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9098390 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9098391 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9098392 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9098393 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
9098394 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
9098395 may be the extra nudge some women need to get started

9098532 we fear he may well have already gone possibly to england or to another french port its also possible hes gone to belgium or the netherlands
9098533 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9098534 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9098535 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9098536 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9098537 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9098538 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9098539 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9098540 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9098541 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9098542 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9098543 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9098544 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9098545 grace is an exchange student and will be spending the school year over here
9098546 were here to shoot her with her host family and her school and other things shell be doing
9098547 its the essence of high school supporting your team being one group with one vision
9098548 ive never seen one before because we dont have sports teams like this i thought it was also really neat how the kids gave the principals those gifts i have the feeling that many students in this school like the principal in germany we have a different kind of relationship with our teachers and principals but i like the relationships better here
9098549 i think the exchange program offers a wonderful opportunity to students in other countries to come to america
9098550 the film crew came as a total surprise to me but their show will open doors of our community to other parts of the world
9098551 the show is pretty popular in germany so i wanted to be part of it
9098552 plus i get money for it so thats cool too
9098553 when people view this show i think theyll see some initial frustration and anxiety any new student would incur
9098554 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
9098555 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
9098556 im reluctant to go in with a budget that really doesnt meet our needs and have someone force us to cut it further
9098557 it is unfortunate that property tax reductions will not allow keeping employees even with inflation
9098558 it is hoped we can at least keep them a little ahead of their increased health insurance contribution while employee wages will be less than inflation i would remind us that inflation over the past four years was less than wage salary increases realized during those years hopefully employees will remember that and not feel so badly about slipping back some
9098559 right now we just dont have a real good guess
9098560 150 000 if we have a harsh winter is not going to be enough for salt
9098561 their expenses have been higher than their income and we cant afford to give them money for their capital projects out of both the levy and edit funds
9098562 so it could be a couple of years before we see a decrease due to job losses
9098563 i just want to prove to myself what type of player i am
9098564 if i meet my standards everyone will be able to judge and i think they will be satisfied i just want to prove it to myself
9098565 i dont look at it that way because i feel like theyve been playing a lot of football even though they havent
9098566 but factually and statistically they dont own a lot of starts under their belts
9098567 i think hes very strong so if he hits somebody theyre going to feel it
9098568 its going to be fun its going to be a battle
9098569 but i just take it as it is i know hes a good player but im not caught up in that i just want to go out there and do what i have to do
9098570 its football thats what it is its nothing different just bumps and bruises and tackles its the game
9098571 its true i havent played in a while ive just been practicing but its also exciting its a good feeling im just going to go out there and do my best
9098572 were more united than last year actually i probably feel that way because im in it now and part of it
9098573 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
9098574 we ve got a bunch of animals and we can t just up and leave them
9098575 this house is pretty strong and i think it s stronger now than it ever was before
9098576 the blessing if there is one is that it s a three day weekend
9098577 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9098578 we try not to pull the trigger too early on evacuation because you don t want to have false alarms
9098579 the anxiety on the coast is palpable you could cut it with a knife
9098580 global rises in oil and food prices are having a significant impact on the japanese public
9098581 it is important that we support the people and small firms and strengthen the japanese economy
9098582 talk of replacing fukuda will resume and the need for more decisive leadership will become more urgent
9098583 we will maintain our basic stance that we aim to achieve growth and strengthen the economy through reforms
9098584 now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are
9098585 you make a decision and that was that dominguez played the first half and arshavin the second its as simple as that
9098586 they tottenham had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22 million like everybody has been writing but just 16 million
9098587 ive kept out of doing this kind of interview you have to be quite careful unless youre one of those people whos happy to give everything of themselves and i for one am not
9098588 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9098589 oh no you didnt have your collar all scruffed up like that for the pictures did you
9098590 becoming chancellor is completely different from any other appointment completely different even when times are easy its important because youre dealing with money and money affects how everything works when times are far from easy its even more difficult and we knew the economy was going to slow down
9098591 i remember i picked up the ft in the supermarket as you do and it had the european central bank starting to put money into the economy i phoned the office to ask why they were doing quite so much it didnt surprise me that money was going in there was concern going around but it was the sheer scale of it i said what about our institutions this was when northern rock started to figure
9098592 i received a phone call and went straight down to london from where i never returned that was the last time i saw edinburgh
9098593 this is a disaster this is terrible i said we have to search the place from top to bottom one of them said well start monday i said no we start today i phoned gordon up i said we appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country we knew it was bad
9098594 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9098595 theres got to be a life outside politics it was nice to go to the pictures and go for a nice meal afterwards one of the great pleasures was getting to edinburgh and going out for a meal with friends who dont do politics
9098596 the waiter came over and said too much wine in a loud voice so we stuck to the one bottle for the entire meal
9098597 well i think most people understand perfectly well that most of the problems they face are international however that doesnt help sell their house i was at a filling station recently and a chap said i know its to do with oil prices but what are you going to do about it people think well surely you can do something you are responsible so of course it reflects on me
9098598 no theres nothing more pathetic than people feeling sorry for themselves so you get on with it you just have to deal with it theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9098599 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually
9098600 and you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9098601 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9098602 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9098603 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9098604 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9098605 we were an ordinary family we talked about events but we didnt sit around the table having intense discussions about what marx thought
9098606 very different people but we had a very clear sense of what was right and what was wrong my father always thought conservatism was about helping people less fortunate than you my mother was very clear about what you did and didnt do she was very clear about saying thank you and being courteous
9098607 strictly bread and butter issues things like food prices in the student refectory
9098608 if you want to make any changes theres only one way you can do it and thats by getting into a position where you can influence things and the obvious thing to do seemed to be to join a party
9098609 just i suppose overall i thought the tories were unfair they were only for one side and not for everyone the labour party just seemed to reflect my outlook on life you know that we were better working together fairness helping everyone to get on rather than just a few the labour government in 1977 was in a terrible mess and i was getting fed up looking at all these things on the television and thinking god surely we can do better than that i wanted to do things but i was never really interested in the theory of achieving things just the practicality of doing things
9098610 we werent the ones who leaked it it had already appeared in other newspapers before and at any other time i would just have ignored it but understandably i was asked about it
9098611 then i need to deal with a whole range of things
9098612 yes all right but if youre going to announce anything in the housing market you dont do it in the middle of august its just a silly time to do it
9098613 i get very exasperated when people say we need to show people we are concerned its just the wrong approach i think theres not a man woman or child in this country who doesnt understand the problems people are facing people are not particularly interested in public demonstrations of your understanding you just need to get on with it
9098614 i wouldnt personalise it my criticism is not of him as an individual
9098615 why i think the tories are bad is different from why i think osborne would be a bad chancellor
9098616 i think my criticisms are of the tory party rather than him
9098617 the tories havent really changed they may have packaged things differently but fundamentally i think they are still very much focused on helping a few people and not very bothered about most people
9098618 there are times when i listen to cameron and im not sure what he does believe in i dont say that in any nasty sense i just dont have any sense of what if he was prime minister he would want to do
9098619 i think youre right george osborne is a politician and hes made an enormous amount of promises but its not clear how he would pay for them osborne knows what hes doing in terms of playing the political field thats why i say hes a very good politician because he takes his moment but whats his long term view of where the country needs to go what is his vision for the future what sort of country does he see britain becoming in the next 20 to 30 years i just dont know
9098620 half a dozen eggs that would be 1 20 i know they have cheaper ones i saw them but the ones my wife specifically wanted were 1 20
9098621 i much prefer to be doing things than shouting about them
9098622 part of politics is you do need to shout politics is the art of communication if you cant communicate then it doesnt matter if youre truly brilliant as a technocrat there are lots of people who are very good but they just cant communicate it
9098623 well it was the same reaction i used to have with the blairs thank god i dont have to do that
9098624 i mean it was probably an accurate representation of both of them i didnt honestly i just couldnt get excited about those pictures one way or the other i mean of course theyre both posed cameron was as posed as they come
9098625 but im not going to be hypocritical about it when ive spent 15 minutes on a beach being photographed in a very unnatural posture
9098626 thats why im not a great politician you know im not very good at looking at pictures and subjecting them to the equivalent of textual analysis
9098627 theres nothing wrong with the term its just not one i use
9098628 im not offended if someone earns large sums of money is it fair or not its just a fact of life
9098629 pragmatic i passionately believe in living in a fair country and treating people properly with proper respect and fairness
9098630 as a minister by and large i had a charmed life i was sorting out problems rather than being landed with them
9098631 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
9098632 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
9098633 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
9098634 it used to be said that the business of america was business
9098635 by far the biggest rivalry going on in the chess world right now
9098636 we have so much depth our bench is uncomparable sic to the other teams in the league
9098637 the whole idea was to do the totally nonsensical interview with some trash talking
9098638 im a chess professional so basically im going with whoever gives me better conditions
9098639 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
9098640 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
9098641 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best
9098642 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
9098643 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best after recovery and rehab i plan to resume touring in the fall
9098644 by the time january rolls around i will be dancing on the deck onboard the jazz cruises llc smooth jazz cruise that i host annually there is a lot more music inside me and once i am back on my feet i look forward to sharing my joy with my fans friends and fellow musicians
9098645 i thank you in advance for your prayers and well wishes
9098646 that is one of the main reasons why parents are keen to encourage their children to practice chess more than other sports which some regard as a waste of time they also believe their children should benefit from the time they spend in other sports which takes them away from studying
9098647 it is similarly unconstitutional it shares some problem and frankly creates others
9098648 we would have hoped that they recognize that this is just not an area that this municipality or any municipality is supposed to delve into
9098649 in terms especially of housing this particularly is aligned with other decisions around the country that tell cities that courts find that type of ordinance crosses over into an area that the federal government has expressly deemed theirs
9098650 she was on the city commission she was a mayor she was a governor shes business oriented shes even environmentally conscious
9098651 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9098652 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9098653 we send our congratulations to gov sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9098654 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9098655 i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers
9098656 the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9098657 i thought it was just a toot mom but it was poop
9098658 why are you asking me did you just poop your pants
9098659 to the world you may just be a person but to a person you may be the world
9098660 a wise girl kisses but doesnt love listens but doesnt believe and leaves before she is left
9098661 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
9098662 this is my 12th record but for the first time i did have a loose concept
9098663 i started to think about what it is about my playing or my sound that people have been digging and it does have a little bit of that seductive quality it does have that low fat tone thing
9098664 so i wanted to make almost like a marvin gaye record where you can put it on and it can set this almost incredible mood its like make out music
9098665 if you go out and play a show just like the record it doesnt have the right feeling you want a whole lot of energy and intensity when youre onstage
9098666 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
9098667 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
9098668 the ati radeon hd 4870 is based on the long awaited ati rv770 gpu which replaces the rv670 gpu that powered the disappointing ati radeon hd 3870 gpu both rv770 and the older rv670 are built on the same 55 nm fabrication process but thats where the similarity ends
9098669 im not fiddling with it im just spinning the wheels
9098670 im not doing anything to it im just looking at it
9098671 lets try this another way how would you feel if you had prosthetic legs and someone picked them up while you were sitting laying someplace and they picked them up because they were intricately constructed and they wanted to see how they worked unintentionally someone breaks a small piece but a vital one and hey presto you have a repair bill or have to get a new set altogether the chair is my feet how would you feel if some medical student felt your legs were fascinating removed them in some magically painless way and started to reverse engineer them
9098672 i dont know when were going to hit the earth if well hit sooner than i expect or someone else will make that decision for me
9098673 but im at the controls and i know were descending
9098674 the problem was the bank was well capitalized for much of last year and actively discussing capital infusions with investors
9098675 you dont want to take over a bank that has private sector solutions available this is a recognition there was no private sector solution left at that point any friday after june 30 would have worked to my knowledge
9098676 there are a number of institutions that dont look that dis similar and this isnt the only failure well see here
9098677 but in a sense nobody knows the long term impact of this failure
9098678 got caught in all the bad thing other lenders have been caught in they never diversified their asset base
9098679 after it became clear that netbank would not be able to complete certain conditions required to close and receive regulatory approval
9098680 we will continue to watch the storm closely and ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate
9098681 we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9098682 our approach in texas is to prepare for the worst and pray for the best
9098683 our goal is to control gustav and not let gustav control us
9098684 this is a very dangerous storm make no doubt about it we fully expect a category 3 or 4 hurricane
9098685 we havent published those yet actually were just getting ready to write them up and send them off
9098686 the cathode material has been a little more difficult but we have several different candidates and we have made full working batteries
9098687 once you do the genetic engineering with the viruses themselves you pour in the solution and they grow the right combination of these materials on them
9098688 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9098689 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9098690 russia violated the security zone patrolled by un peacekeeping forces deployed by the un security council
9098691 in abkhazia russia is violating not only the territorial integrity of georgia but also the integrity of this council
9098692 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states about weapons of mass destruction have you found them in iraq yet or are you still looking for them
9098693 the us and some european states promised georgian president mr saakashvili natos protection and have started supplying him with new weapons it obviously invites fresh provocations
9098694 i want to be sensitive to what those employees are going through right now and be responsive to them
9098695 i want to help them understand who we are as a company and answer any questions they may have along with our new customers
9098696 id be disingenuous to sit here and say we will open 100 branches tomorrow
9098697 but we wont sit still and wait for the market to turn around either
9098698 they have some really fine locations and well have some internal discussions when those assets come up for sale from the fdic

9098702 the operation described as extremely successful was halted recently in connection with plans for an impending us air attack on iran along with this targets would also be bombed which were connected with the dutch espionage action
9098703 one of the agents involved who was able to infiltrate the iranian industry under the supervision of the aivd was recently recalled because the us was thought to be making a decision within weeks to attack iran with unmanned aircraft among the potential targets were said to be not only nuclear plants but also military installations that have been brought to light partly by the agency of the aivd
9098704 information from the aivd operation has in recent years been shared with the american cia secret service
9098705 various supplies could also be sabotaged and stopped these were parts for missiles and launching equipment

9098710 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9098711 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9098712 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9098713 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9098714 thats part of why the church had to push back
9098715 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9098716 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9098717 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9098718 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9098719 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9098720 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9098721 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick

9098723 hell freezes over nvidia announces native sli support for the intel x58 chipset
9098724 when they were top dog they could have gotten away with this
9098725 we heard from the very start that most motherboard manufacturers werent going to use the nforce 200 intel x58 combination
9098726 thats the nforce 200 been the only solution and thats been a very very high end solution
9098727 i can see where some people would think that in the longer term especially with the i7
9098728 the h o p e mobile has been without a primary care provider for seven months
9098729 i am thrilled that we have found kat and know that she will do a phenomenal job
9098730 i believe the communitys understanding of the h o p e mobile will be enhanced with my service to patients in both clinics
9098731 i am looking forward to providing logan county with the care they want and need
9098732 she is an innovative creative motivated warm and caring individual we are fortunate to have her in our organization
9098733 we have no experience with this kind of a storm and after katrina there is no way we are staying
9098734 it does look like this will be a strong storm
9098735 we look forward to a better day even as we prepare for a threat to come
9098736 i took a little vacation recently nine hours in sun valley idaho before an evening speaking engagement the sky was deep blue the air crystalline the hills green a
9098737 red white and blue murder is the first of bill criders novels i have read and it was better than i imagined it is a unique blend of whodunit and american style hardboiled probably something like 75 of the former and 25 of the later the whodunit part is the comfortable setting the townspeople pestering conniving kind and likable it is a place the reader would love to visit and in a literary manner it is a place you have been before but not for a very long time
9098738 battery life will decrease by a small amount its about 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes and thats because theres a larger power draw with the brighter screen
9098739 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9098740 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9098741 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9098742 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9098743 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9098744 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9098745 vocalize your feelings make us emotionally comfortable and put your ego away
9098746 im a big fan of the third date the first two are so awkward if things didnt go well keep after her women will give you the benefit of the doubt

9098751 to hell with it were just gonna target a brand new demographic just about every hardcore gamer who wants something fresh and every casual gamer on earth
9098752 were hoping hes not as bad as vickerman but the only potential sinister thing there is a potential fracture
9098753 well get that cleared so well have clarity as to the likely length of his lay off
9098754 hopefully he will be a possibility before our next encounter who knows
9098755 i think when he left south africa he was a massive loss to south africa and a huge gain for australia
9098756 hes one of the unique type of locks as a five lock hes very much in the victor matfield mould where he just has an uncanny knack for reading the lineouts and being very good at it
9098757 hes had a fantastic test career and i think hell be sorely missed in australia
9098758 i wouldnt have foreseen that he would have played with victor because i dont think anybody in their right mind would leave bakkies botha out
9098759 its impossible to tell it may have been a fantastic rotation policy with the three of them should dan have stayed in south africa but he didnt
9098760 we saw mark play against sydney in the pre season cup and he was exceptional
9098761 marks been there and done that and i dont nerves will play any part in it
9098762 considering the squad that weve had for both of our opening games with a wee bit of luck we could have won both games and could be sitting top of the a league
9098763 there have been a lot of positives to come out of both games young defender pedj bojic has been outstanding nigel boogaard is back now matt simon is back and doing well sasho petrovski is doing well and adrian caceres and ahmad elrich are getting better with every game
9098764 jedinak and macallister will be up for selection on sunday itll take us about two or three weeks for our squad to get bigger which puts more pressure on players to perform which is what its all about
9098765 like everyone else we wont to get a win on the board
9098766 were travelling alright and after two games were only two points off top spot
9098767 you can call him a great or legend without embarrassing yourself or wasting words
9098768 hes inspirational hes such a wonderful player with great gifts and hes made those great gifts even better because of his attitude
9098769 ive been proud of them on many occasions this year
9098770 locky played 13 out of 22 or half the season justin hodges has played 10 out of 22 and theyre major strike players for us
9098771 early in the season we didnt know what they were going to deliver with no lockyer knee but they were tremendous
9098772 we can do better we know that and were working towards that we have to do better but we know were not far off the pace
9098773 he just hasnt been able to make the side because micks been playing so well
9098774 he was out of form and we sent him back to the central queensland comets for a while and he hasnt had the opportunities
9098775 but hes got one tomorrow and i hope he grabs it and shows us all what he can like when he first came here
9098776 the last time we played them they hadnt won a lot of games and they were struggling but they beat us
9098777 thats the lesson you have to understand in the nrl is that everybody is capable of beating you if youre not on your game
9098778 continued strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9098779 on this track the center of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands late friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on saturday night or sunday

9098786 i am saddened to learn of the death of gladys powers who may have been the worlds last surviving female service veteran from the first world war
9098787 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
9098788 although they may not have realised it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those servicewomen who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
9098789 we expressed the hope that the draft bimstec convention be finalised as soon as possible for signing during the next bimstec summit

9098794 initial investigation point it out to be a case of suicide
9098795 the police have requested for permission to conduct a viscera test on the deceased the police do not want to leave anything to chance and we are probing all angles
9098796 the time between discovery of the body and the time of death can also throw some light on the case the time gap is important and if was long then it is certainly questionable
9098797 nothing suspicious has emerged so far and suicide is the most strong line of investigation but the reason for that needs to be established
9098798 even the girls personal diary has not revealed anything much there is no concrete evidence to support that she was under depression
9098799 the centre central government is providing all possible assistance to bihar to deal with the flood situation four army columns five helicopters 118 boats and 624 national disaster response forces have been provided

9098942 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9098943 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9098944 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9098945 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

9098950 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9098951 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9098952 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9098953 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9098954 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9098955 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9098956 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9098957 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9098958 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

9098962 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9098963 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9098964 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9098965 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9098966 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

9098970 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
9098971 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9098972 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9098973 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9098974 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9098975 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9098976 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9098977 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9098978 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9098979 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before

9098982 carlos fabra es un ciudadano y un pol tico ejemplar
9098983 whether its your newborns more hardened appearance the way he now approaches people with guarded skepticism or just that look on his face that says oh wait maybe life isnt all hugs and kisses and rainbows
9098984 registration is necessary but it is not possible within the deadline fixed by the election commission more time has to be set aside
9098985 no political party held upazila or zila parishad elections in the last 16 years so the people now dont trust the political parties holding upazila elections before the jatiya sangsad elections under the present caretaker government is necessary
9098986 we are victims of political vengeance lately ghalib got bail and acquitted in some cases were respectful of the judiciary
9098987 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9098988 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
9098989 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9098990 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9098991 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9098992 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
9098993 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9098994 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9098995 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9098996 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9098997 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9098998 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9098999 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500
9099000 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
9099001 bringing together this number of people from across the world creates unique challenges
9099002 by not counting those gone missing the government estimates not only result in inadequate compensation and rehabilitation processes but also underplay the need for rescue and relief
9099003 last year 20 million people were affected this year its far less but they are in a region that does not have the capacity to deal with floodwaters like this
9099004 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9099005 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9099006 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9099007 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9099008 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9099009 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9099010 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9099011 que nos vamos a salir del banco del sur pero esta propuesta llevamos nueve a os haci ndola luego cay en una situaci n de avance muy lento y muchos debates cosas t cnicas y somos de los que opinamos que no hay tiempo que perder

9099021 only about 10 per cent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 per cent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9099022 from increasing working families incomes to nearly 7 500 a year to a decline of more than 2 000 a year from almost 8 million americans lifted out of poverty to more than 5 5 million driven into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance

9099032 recalls can take time and the commission felt that time was of the essence and that warning the public about this product was so important that we could not wait until a recall was announced
9099033 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
9099034 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com

9099037 it wasnt the kind of ball striking i would have liked to have had
9099038 there were a few fakeouts but its good not to get too exasperated its a relatively short course with a few silly shots
9099039 any time you shoot 66 at pebble beach you should be satisfied
9099040 there are a lot of guys out there whod like to shoot 66
9099041 it started out like it was going to be an uneventful round
9099042 i missed a few early putts but i played a very solid round in 32 years of playing here it was one of the better rounds ive played
9099043 ive been playing very very well for the last month and a half
9099044 its kind of exciting again im doing everything right right now im driving the ball well and im hitting some pretty good irons and giving myself opportunities
9099045 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9099046 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
9099047 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9099048 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9099049 government can not solve all problems but there are some things that it can do
9099050 you do this n that and then youre on your own
9099051 so what were those problems that the government could not solve
9099052 how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a mans property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
9099053 and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
9099054 a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
9099055 but fha federal housing authority and the veterans administration tell us they have 120 000 housing units theyve taken back through mortgage foreclosure
9099056 no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so governments programs once launched never disappear
9099057 there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that social security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble

9099075 i nearly went to middlebury to play hockey and lacrosse kyle sweeney helped me settle down at georgetown he taught me how to be aggressive but smart when youre a wingman on a faceoff dont rush the pile too quickly when im getting a ground ball all im focused on is getting the ball and then getting out of trouble
9099076 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
9099077 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
9099078 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins
9099079 neither a farewell or a resurrection its a thank you
9099080 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
9099081 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
9099082 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
9099083 peter will of course announce in due course precisely what he intends to do and i look forward to it and as ive said so many times before if he chooses to stay in the parliament ill be very happy
9099084 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
9099085 im very hopeful that peter costello will come back hed be a great leader hed be a great prime minister
9099086 i want peter to stay in parliament who leads the coalition is a decision for another day
9099087 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them
9099088 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him
9099089 i hope he does stay on hed be the best thing for the country
9099090 i think whatever he chooses to do well support him in that because hes earned the right to make the decision he wants to make
9099091 dr nelson acknowledged the impressive contribution that peter costello made and i think the reception that he received inside the room was very favourable
9099092 il nous pose la question du go t social et du go t social un hard rocker peut il r v ler aimer c line dion

9099096 we all look forward to that last trip to the beach or to a final summer visit to see friends or relatives
9099097 but what most of us dont know is that the benefits of our summer travel will stay with us long after weve returned home
9099098 the evidence is overwhelming that when you take a trip the benefits are everywhere
9099099 despite the fact that americans get less vacation time than in any country in the industrialized world because of the personal benefits gained we cant afford not to travel
9099100 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
9099101 this trend points to a desire on the part of the american public to seek alternatives to flying and driving to enjoy the traditional end of summer vacation
9099102 this is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever
9099103 el reino de los cielos es semejante a un tesoro escondido en un campo que al encontrarlo un hombre vuelve a esconderlo y por la alegr a que le da va vende todo lo que tiene y compra el campo aquel

9099105 bring games to those who cannot play arcade type games using conventional controls due to disability
9099106 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
9099107 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9099108 this town was built on the idea that theres strength in numbers and that the unions were a good thing
9099109 i feel like were kind of dwindling on that purpose without the unions and the railroad this town would be awful poor
9099110 a major factor has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
9099111 they have to stretch a lot before they do anything and we have a new squad so we have not been stunting yet but once we do we are going to make sure everyone knows their position and job once we put someone up in the air
9099112 if we did get injured our coaches would be there so no worries
9099113 im sorry that this his death was how his kindness was repaid
9099114 i want people to know that our family is proud of kazuya
9099115 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9099116 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9099117 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9099118 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9099119 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9099120 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe
9099121 its because i am in a leadership role and i will not subject my privates to undue influence
9099122 but if everybody in the platoon is voting for obama anyway and you are voting for obama then how can you exert undue influence
9099123 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
9099124 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
9099125 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go

9099129 good scoop on the boumedienne signing alec where do you see him fitting in the organization
9099130 i know its getting as drawn out as the sundin saga but whats the latest with the mccabe situation seems to me that mccabe is worth more than van ryn thanks bud
9099131 ive bought my tickets for the rookie tournament in kitchener on sept 13 15 afterwards i browse the roster disappointed not to see kulemin there im gonna love sneaking a peak at schenn but was equally excited to see kulemin can i get half my money back theres no pogge either outside of schenn theres isnt a lot to see any advice as to who i can watch when schenns not on the ice would be greatly appreciated
9099132 i know i am really getting ahead of myself here but this may be the only good thing that leafs fans have to look forward to this year
9099133 something may have happened with toronto that has brought jay back into play
9099134 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9099135 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9099136 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9099137 thats part of why the church had to push back
9099138 i have a dream that one day a man of african heritage will rise up from humble beginnings and take the reins of imperial power bombing and starving poor people hes never met in order appease those affluent few who made his ascent possible i have a dream today
9099139 the difference between successful people and failures is that successful people make a habit of doing the things that failures do not like to do
9099140 it tastes very much like ground beef but its a very mild very lean meat
9099141 you can put it in a can and use it to make stew with some vegetables and potatoes its wonderful
9099142 its interchangeable with ground beef but we rarely eat that because we get a lot of wild game here
9099143 if you get an old big one they are tougher but the younger smaller ones give us 300 to 400 pounds of meat and we share it with our family
9099144 touched on the very basics of doing more than just hitting random buttons
9099145 if they want a bigger fish it may be difficult to have both recreational anglers and commercials operating in the same areas
9099146 that could lead to establishing separate areas where places with good shore access are recreational areas and places with difficult access are commercial access
9099147 i dont think its a matter of getting size or abundance theres two issues allocation of existing fish and restoring the fishery
9099148 you cant give what dnr gives the commercials and give us the scraps
9099149 we said wed provide a good home for it it was a good match
9099150 weve been working with the potomac appalachian trail club to draft a plan for renovating the mill its conceivable we could be open next year
9099151 the project has gone a lot slower than id have liked but its moving now were getting critical mass
9099152 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
9099153 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
9099154 i told you that id know nothing and that is the truth
9099155 alan moore you wrote my favorite issues of radioactive man
9099156 oh really so you liked that i made your favorite superhero a heroin addicted jazz critic whos not radioactive
9099157 i dont read the words i just like when he punches people
9099158 i heard you get on it married and when you get off it youre single
9099159 it just was a straight shot straight down the lane he hit the curb and flew through the window
9099160 there was blood everywhere and there were bodies all over the place
9099161 i went in to see if i could help there was nothing that could be done for anyone in the front of the store
9099162 the one girl was lying on the floor in front of the store a lady and myself checked to see if she had a pulse but she had nothing she was bleeding pretty bad she wasnt moving
9099163 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9099164 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9099165 those people will have more serious illness associated mostly with a fever and some other signs of more invasive disease where the disease has spread into their body or bloodstream
9099166 even if theyve eaten product they dont need to go see their doctor or go to the emergency room simply because they are concerned they might have listeriosis
9099167 it certainly is creating some pressures in our emergency rooms so we are trying to give people some good information about what they should watch for when they should seek medical attention and when they dont need to seek medical attention
9099168 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9099169 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9099170 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9099171 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9099172 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9099173 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9099174 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9099175 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9099176 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9099177 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9099178 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9099179 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9099180 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9099181 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9099182 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them
9099183 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9099184 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9099185 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9099186 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9099187 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9099188 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9099189 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9099190 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9099191 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9099192 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9099193 i was grateful to have all those months to prepare
9099194 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9099195 estou saindo de cora o partido porque amo este clube pedi para que o s o paulo me liberasse porque estou num momento da carreira que preciso garantir um futuro melhor
9099196 this is a great day for the united states navy and for the men and women of electric boat
9099197 we had high hopes for the new hampshire and im happy to say its exceeded all expectations
9099198 thats a pretty remarkable accomplishment this is the most complete virginia class ship at delivery of any in the class

9099200 the special ops can go ashore gather information and come back totally undetected
9099201 the experimental warhead section of the rocket hit its pre determined target with high accuracy at the firing range
9099202 are you a highly motivated positive individual looking for an incredible career opportunity
9099203 i am saddened to learn of the death of gladys powers who may have been the worlds last surviving female service veteran from the first world war
9099204 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
9099205 although they may not have realised it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those servicewomen who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
9099206 you can call him a great or legend without embarrassing yourself or wasting words
9099207 hes inspirational hes such a wonderful player with great gifts and hes made those great gifts even better because of his attitude
9099208 ive been proud of them on many occasions this year
9099209 locky played 13 out of 22 or half the season justin hodges has played 10 out of 22 and theyre major strike players for us
9099210 early in the season we didnt know what they were going to deliver with no lockyer knee but they were tremendous
9099211 we can do better we know that and were working towards that we have to do better but we know were not far off the pace
9099212 he just hasnt been able to make the side because micks been playing so well
9099213 he was out of form and we sent him back to the central queensland comets for a while and he hasnt had the opportunities
9099214 but hes got one tomorrow and i hope he grabs it and shows us all what he can like when he first came here
9099215 the last time we played them they hadnt won a lot of games and they were struggling but they beat us
9099216 thats the lesson you have to understand in the nrl is that everybody is capable of beating you if youre not on your game
9099217 if we go down there tomorrow thinking we just got to turn up like we did here in brisbane then were going to get a rude shock because theyre capable of beating us
9099218 were hoping hes not as bad as vickerman but the only potential sinister thing there is a potential fracture
9099219 well get that cleared so well have clarity as to the likely length of his lay off
9099220 hopefully he will be a possibility before our next encounter who knows
9099221 i think when he left south africa he was a massive loss to south africa and a huge gain for australia
9099222 hes one of the unique type of locks as a five lock hes very much in the victor matfield mould where he just has an uncanny knack for reading the lineouts and being very good at it
9099223 hes had a fantastic test career and i think hell be sorely missed in australia
9099224 i wouldnt have foreseen that he would have played with victor because i dont think anybody in their right mind would leave bakkies botha out
9099225 its impossible to tell it may have been a fantastic rotation policy with the three of them should dan have stayed in south africa but he didnt
9099226 were very blessed in south africa weve got some fantastic second rowers dans a fantastic player but were very very lucky we were able to in 2007 win a world cup without him and in 2004 win a tri nations without him
9099227 continued strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9099228 on this track the center of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands late friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on saturday night or sunday
9099229 i am concerned that there are still a number of persons who are still unaccounted for
9099230 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9099231 firefox doesnt know how to open this address because the protocol ed2k isnt associated with any program
9099232 there is no requirement to believe in a god of any sort within our faith at last count 19 of unitarian universalists said that they did not believe in any type of god some unitarian universalist congregations are more deistic god centered than others while some congregations regularly refer to god in worship and prayer others have a much more varied approach to addressing the religious spirit even in those congregations where they often use the word god its ok if you dont believe in a god
9099233 my conceptualization of god does not do that does not say that does not think that
9099234 for many unitarian universalists jesus and christian teachings provide insight into understanding how to live our lives the bible and its many interpretations have largely shaped our unitarian universalist history today it is used in most unitarian universalist congregations as one of many sources of inspiration and reflection to quote one member i claim the bible as one more chapter among several religious texts in the unitarian universalist guide to living laura spencer this is not the only view of jesus the bible and christianity within our faith a portion of unitarian universalists today identify as christians but even some unitarian universalists who do not identify primarily as christians find inspiration in christian ideas because of the freedom within our faith there are many differing views regarding the role of christianity in our religious community

9099240 while applying to a university never shy away from asking for a financial aid
9099241 we were questioned on personal matters as well as academics current affairs and our opinions on issues and policies were also touched upon
9099242 were in the process of contacting our chief stewards in the institutions and asking them to participate and to work with the ministry to get people rounded up to support this
9099243 we hope its not a whitewash and just a coverup of what the real concerns are of the staff out there at the corrections centre
9099244 passengers in phuket have been accommodated if they havent been able to remain in their hotels that they were already staying in
9099245 once weve got the advice from dfat department of foreign affairs and trade and the airport is open then we will know that we can operate out

9099247 there are on going large political demonstrations in bangkok a number of which have been disruptive and have blocked access to key buildings and roads
9099248 the demonstrations have also affected access to some airports including in bangkok phuket hat yai and krabi and disrupted some rail and air services
9099249 se est trabajando bien obviamente sin desesperarse buscando una oportunidad la cual espero que se d pronto
9099250 primero hay que pensar en el buen resultado y comportamiento del equipo si se me da la oportunidad hay que hacerlo al cien por ciento con las ganas obviamente de regresar a la titularidad
9099251 es un equipo al que le gusta jugar mucho con la pelota es din mico salen jugando y el hecho de jugar en canc n los hace m s peligrosos pero nosotros hay que ser inteligentes tratar de seguir con nuestro mismo estilo de juego y con el mismo ritmo
9099252 al equipo lo veo bien mentalmente que es lo m s importante en este momento pienso que no se ha jugado bien pero se han sacado resultados importantes eso la verdad que ayuda mucho al equipo y te da la confianza de seguir trabajando igual
9099253 muy importante llegamos en igualdad de circunstancias seis puntos estaremos en nuestra casa creo que es un partido para nosotros muy importante siempre buscamos ganar ahora viendo la situaci n del grupo pues por supuesto que mucho m s es un partido clave somos rivales de grupo y el que gane se acerca arriba y el que pierda se separa m s
9099254 when you get an education that is something nobody can take from you money is only temporary but what you have in your head if you have the right kind of head stays with you
9099255 if you cant do the big attacks do the small attacks do smaller attacks and more of them
9099256 debemos hacer sobre todo un partido equilibrado porque estos partidos as se tienen que ganar
9099257 debemos esperar a ver qui n inicia es decisi n del t cnico pero quien juegue es confiable pero a final de cuentas el profe es quien decide a final de cuentas debemos echarnos la mano todos juntos
9099258 pero los resultados no se le han dado como esperaban han propuesto no han tenido fortuna nosotros debemos preocuparnos por nosotros porque necesitamos sacar una victoria
9099259 no la verdad es que no ser nada sencillo tienen el problema del descenso entonces van a jugar con todo est n en su cancha nosotros vamos a tratar de hacer un partido inteligente para traernos un buen resultado
9099260 no debemos tener desatenciones atr s y aprovechar las oportunidades que tengamos adelante
9099261 ya tuvimos una salida est es la segunda pero esperamos que las cosas salgan bien lo importante sumar y mejor de visitante
9099262 cruz azul hidalgo ha sido consistente ya que es bien dirigido y claro que ser un rival dif cil pero m s que como un obst culo lo vemos como un reto para demostrar lo que somos
9099263 hemos tenido buenos resultados esperamos seguir igual y que de esta manera podamos dejar de preocuparnos por la tabla de cociente y enfocarnos al cien por ciento en calificar a la liguilla
9099264 as es el futbol estamos muy contentos con el apoyo de los dos y muy a gusto aqu las instalaciones son envidiables aqu en yucat n
9099265 de esta manera la provincia mantiene el porcentaje de lo ofertado a comienzos de esta semana pero se modifica la metodolog a ya que se dejar a de lado el desdoblamiento y se efectuar a de una vez
9099266 porque unifica lo que antes era un aumento desdoblado a cobrar con los sueldos de agosto y noviembre
9099267 esperamos la convocatoria el lunes pr ximo no m s all de esa fecha si no hay ning n llamado realizaremos una medida de fuerza que puede ser de 72 horas
9099268 se abstengan de introducir cualquier modificaci n que ponga en riesgo las condiciones jubilatorias de los trabajadores estatales y el super vit que hoy tiene el ips instituto de previsi n social por el aporte fundamentalmente del subsistema docente
9099269 lo que s podemos hacer es ofrecer otra modalidad dentro de la masa salarial
9099270 un aumento que se da semestralmente es un paso adelante y de esa manera vamos manteniendo un ritmo persistente de mejora del salario docente
9099271 est muy por encima de lo que pod amos dar ya que nuestra propuesta original era del 7
9099272 seguramente no se incluyan los descuentos por los d as no trabajados

9099745 palin is on a massive extermination program for wolves across large swaths of alaska to artificially inflate caribou and moose populations to pacify trophy hunters
9099746 its totally illogical its extreme its the draconian manipulation of bears of wolves in alaska

9099930 they have all the weapons we have its going to be a great challenge juice likes to a great runner a great passer theyll put benn in the backfield a little bit
9099931 we dont hit we dont play defense and we dont pitch
9099932 thats the result i think it feels like we had another day off now we have two days off in a row hopefully we show up saturday and play better
9099933 you try to avoid those games and hopefully they dont happen often
9099934 but were in a situation now where they are must win games and we cannot sit here and say its another game and its ok
9099935 we have to go as hard as we can we have been fighting for five months and we have one month left now we have to throw the biggest punches we can and hopefully one lands and we knock somebody out thats the way we have to approach every day
9099936 its amazing how this kid shows up to the park every day and plays the way he plays
9099937 he brings a lot of energy right now that kid is the key to their ballclub
9099938 i think if that happens the chicago mayor summer olympics there in 2016 i guarantee you because that citys going to go crazy to the players it would be awesome to the fans but i dont know for me and lou piniella it should be unbelievable
9099939 the only good thing about this water is your can save on hairdressing products because once you set your hair and she dries thats where she stays for the day
9099940 its very salty it corrodes everything it blocks things up it blocks your toilet up
9099941 eventually you have to chisel out the back where they flush down from the bottom drain
9099942 dries your skin out something chronic and im a pretty big boy and hide like a rhino but it dries my skin out and you get little rashes
9099943 its not good that youre getting rashes i have people who come and stay a couple of days here and after two days theyre starting to get a rash it just drives them right out
9099944 when i first came here there wasnt much water at all really
9099945 wed used to run out of water and id run out of customers in the motel every now and then which would stir me up a bit
9099946 i am pleased to advise that the cabinet budget review committee has approved funding towards the cartage of water under the urban drought water program at an expected cost of 400 000 a month
9099947 we anticipate that this could be needed anywhere from four to six months
9099948 premier bligh has said that you know this is a first step
9099949 well shell realise that it is only the first step because were not going to lay down now until we get the whole solution fixed up

9099956 en raz n de las tareas realizadas la misi n quiere reiterar su valoraci n positiva sobre el proceso electoral del referendo

9099962 a high proportion of those children are home schooled in illinois pretty much all of the new cases of measles were among home schooled children and none of them were vaccinated
9099963 in his discussion with me he stepped down because his situation with georgia was going to be dragging on for quite a while
9099964 obviously the situation that happened to francois sainfort and julie jacko has not been a positive one for us
9099965 we have cooperated with the georgia attorney generals office and we were led to understand that they were going to be deciding what path to go down by the end of august or early september
9099966 the last thing that i heard through the us office of general counsel was that the attorney generals office in georgia was a long way away from determining what they are going to do
9099967 what im hopeful for is that the georgia attorney general will choose not to file charges and that they can continue here in their faculty leadership roles
9099968 we have certain issues with expenses that were charged to both institutions that we are looking at which are related to but not the same as issues that are of apparent concern to georgia attorney generals office
9099969 we have only limited ability to obtain documents until they are done with their investigation
9099970 i hope nobody really thinks joe biden lends some sort of foreign policy panacea to the democratic ticket that will make the last eight years of fakery fumbling and fiasco go away
9099971 instrumental in preventing this from becoming a lot worse than it was
9099972 it was blowing so hard i thought it was a water faucet
9099973 for a second i thought i was dead it didnt stop i ran out of there to shut the boiler room gas line off
9099974 i was trying to feel the doors we were yelling trying to find each other as we ran and knocked
9099975 they all got out we were happy and surprised because nobody was hurt
9099976 i feel really awful for all the people that lost their homes
9099977 he is never late he follows the rules and tries to learn every day
9099978 i am very proud because i am teaching him my role is to make somebody better than me
9099979 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth

9099981 during a get out the vote drive you dont want to get out the wrong vote
9099982 can reach who they want to reach without wasting their incredibly valuable media dollars and reach them with the right message
9099983 the web has been hailed for creating new opportunities for political expression but there is this dark underside to it
9099984 yes you can reach everyone but you can track target and profile them as well and none of this is disclosed
9099985 the small businesses the 1 500 donations the 2 000 here and there it all added up to over 250 000
9099986 i slept on a baggage carousel at the airport for eight days during katrina
9099987 i think this ones a little bit different that were getting there before the storm hits and we may be able to prevent major problems as opposed to walking in and trying to solve problems that have been there for a week by the time that we got there
9099988 i think you always have lessons learned from any disaster you go through so youre always smarter the next time around in the case of katrina and rita there were efforts to get things set up ahead of time i think people didnt anticipate how strongly they were going to be hit
9099989 were planning well ahead of time to prepare and stage more assets locally in the area of operations
9099990 days and clouds is a brave film simply for daring to portray a nightmare lurking in the minds of middle aged workers
9099991 every game right now is of equal importance and significance
9099992 i normally see the ball well hes a good pitcher hopefully i can keep that up well see what happens
9099993 we never really had another opportunity he pitched really really well
9099994 i didnt get down on myself after the first inning
9099995 i put it behind me and didnt let it get me down
9099996 he threw the ball better than he has all year
9099997 but at some point our pitchers have to understand that a good outing is a win you can lose a game in the first inning we have to change the mentality that someone threw well but lost 4 3 10 5 or whatever
9099998 it takes a little pressure off knowing that one swing isnt going to beat you
9099999 youd like to tack on and make it easier throughout the game but bush made it hold up
