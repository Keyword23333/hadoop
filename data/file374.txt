3740000 the uk festival scene has been around for so much longer than that in america
3740001 in a way its a part of uk life but its much newer in the us i think they are similar in their set up though and the successful us festivals seem to be based on the whole european style of doing things
3740002 austin city limits is great and so is lollapalooza we went to coachella in indio california this year that is one of the nicest festivals ive ever been to even down to the grounds where it was held the setting is unreal as its in a desert area and its held at a kind of a manufactured oasis in the middle with mountains all around the main way they differ is that us festivals are usually two days at most while in the uk they are longer and people turn up to camp before it even starts
3740003 were hoping that he can be the complete opposite of how things have been the last eight years under george w bush i just think that people are really tired of whats happening are really excited by obama as a candidate
3740004 it is because of him yes were hoping that a democrat will get into the white house but realistically we only had two choices
3740005 but i dont know we would have made a mrs november t shirt
3740006 i dont know if this is right or wrong but i think people are generally excited about him his personality and he seems like an interesting intelligent well spoken person and we are excited about him there has been criticism saying hes just a personality but i dont think thats true we wanted to do the shirt both because we think he is the candidate and we think hes the right person for the job
3740007 its not going be a significant contribution but if we can make some kind of small difference even if its just enough money to make another advertisement or something like that also along that same line weve been trying to organise a benefit in ohio we just want to find a way of saying hey were from this state and it has made some questionable decisions in the past
3740008 this band has been the most satisfying thing ive ever done musically
3740009 oh i love that one part but then we had to do that because so and so had to do this and now im not so psyched on this one
3740010 so its that and touring with three people is amazing
3740011 its as simple as pete and i just getting high and going in the basement and playing for a couple of hours and making songs
3740012 any music that you play in a previous bands will leave a little bit of a trace on what you do next hopefully the good things youve done will add up eventually
3740013 i am witnessing a huge column of russian vehicles coming out of gori on the road towards tbilisi there are something like 100 russian lorries support trucks and some armoured personnel carriers in a column that has taken something like 20 minutes to pass me
3740014 gori has been sealed off by russian troops i was able to get about a kilometre from the city until i got to a checkpoint manned by chechen troops who are under orders to stay there and have set up shooting positions
3740015 the ceasefire agreement specified that they were meant to go backwards they are clearly going forwards

3740022 there has been a man arrested for burglary this morning at an address in shieldfield
3740023 that man is currently detained at pilgrim street police station
3740024 he was not arrested in connection with the murder investigation
3740025 officers from the major investigation team are looking into the circumstances of that burglary and his arrest
3740026 at this stage there is no evidence to link it to the murder but you never say never in this business
3740027 it would be nice to speak to him simply to piece together some of the deceaseds last movements
3740028 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3740029 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3740030 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3740031 our members are facing the reality of a 5 inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
3740032 last month the mayor said that he would see to it that all cleaners on metronet contracts would be paid the london living wage by august at the latest but there is still no sign even of that happening
3740033 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3740034 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
3740035 despite rmt claims that the deal is not equal to that set at metronet tube lines believes its pay and conditions are very competitive and amongst the best in the rail industry
3740036 for example employees get 29 days of annual leave as well as eight bank holidays and employees in operational grades receive an 80 subsidy on travel
3740037 the offer also compares favourably with other pay deals agreed elsewhere this year such as 4 6 for london underground 2 5 for nurses and 1 9 for police

3740188 the motives of women who write sex scenes featuring two or more male characters have never seemed self evident to me

3740191 frontal gelangt zu folgenden schlu folgerungen 1 der hauptangeklagte im gegenw rtigen proze yasser chraidi wurde von deutschen und amerikanischen geheimdiensten zum s ndenbock aufgebaut und ist vermutlich unschuldig 2 mindestens ein angeklagter musbah eter war jahrelang mitarbeiter des amerikanischen geheimdiensts cia 3 gegen einige der hauptverd chtigen ist keine anklage erhoben worden weil sie von westlichen geheimdiensten gesch tzt werden 4 mindestens einer von diesen hat f r den israelischen geheimdienst mossad gearbeitet
3740192 in unserer untersuchung gab es nur einige hinweise die mir erlaubt
3740193 wissen sie man war sehr an der auslieferung interessiert und es gab sogar viele interventionen um ihn zu bekommen
3740194 nein es waren die deutschen aber die amerikaner standen hinter dieser auslieferungsforderung es war v llig klar die amerikaner haben die deutschen angespitzt diese auslieferung zu forcieren
3740195 wir wissen zum beispiel von besuchen von herrn eter in der amerikanischen botschaft damals in ostberlin die sind belegt die sind auch durch stempel und durch beobachtung der stasi belegt die haben das ganz genau gesehen und man mu sich ja auch die situation vorstellen damals in dieser ganz hei en situation fr hjahr 1986 und danach geht ein mitarbeiter der libyer ein angestellter journalist wer er auch immer gewesen ist in die us amerikanische botschaft in ostberlin
3740196 au erdem beabsichtigte die amerikanische abwehr angeblich den agenten mahmoud ahmed ali bei der fabrikation einer sache ber die beteiligung libyscher terroristen am genannten anschlag zu nutzen
3740197 wir erhielten zus tzliche angaben dar ber da mahmoud angeblich agent des westberliner geheimdienstes ist und noch am dritten april 1986 diesen ber eine bevorstehende einfuhr von 30 000 us nach westberlin f r die bezahlung irgendeiner aktion gewarnt hat
3740198 der mossad kam also ins spiel und f r amairi nderte sich alles
3740199 der mossad war in diesem fall in norwegen seit herbst 1991 aktiv zuerst war amairi im gef ngnis dann wurde er wieder freigelassen aufgrund der hiesigen gesetze und dann nderte sich alles
3740200 dal mio punto di vista la situazione di mercato non preoccupante
3740201 para salir de la crisis que atraviesa el sector un grupo de organizaciones bateeiras han constituido la plataforma para a distribuci n do mexill n de galicia pladimega el objetivo que persigue este colectivo del que forman parte organziaciones de productores como opmega cabo de cruz o amegrove y que representa a unas 2 200 bateas es reestructurar la actividad adaptarla a los nuevos tiempos y conseguir el equilibrio en un mercado sujeto desde hace a os a todo tipo de vaivenes la nueva organizaci n se dio a conocer la semana pasada cuando convoc un paro de las descargas de mejill n destinado a industria un paro que mantendr n hasta que tengan a punto todo el dispositivo para empezar a campa a con garant as seg n sus dirigentes
3740202 si bien el resto de las organizaciones bateeiras se sumaron inicialmente al paro para negociar la propuesta de pladimega algunas de ellas ya se han bajado de ese carro al entender que sus intereses y los de la plataforma no discurren por el mismo camino de hecho algunas de estas entidades ten an previsto retomar las descargas de mejill n para industria siempre y cuando los cocederos realizasen pedidos

3740204 we feel that this game is the ea sports freestyle answer to a great wii party game it explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today
3740205 celebrity sports showdown will bring people to the party with a collection of games and celebrities that appeal to everyone
3740206 this is how the rest of the world is working today what about us
3740207 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3740208 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3740209 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3740210 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3740211 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3740212 wtf when is he racing they just said he was getting ready

3740216 to me it seemed more gimmicky a hot chick in the future who does parkour than substantive to me the first person perspective really didnt work for a game where youre trying to manipulate a character through complex spatial puzzles and the challenge often felt more about timing can you jump off this ledge with enough speed at the very last second than brains
3740217 isa diam diam meninggalkan orang tuanya dan bersama dengan para pedagang yerusalem menuju india untuk mempelajari hukum buddha yang agung
3740218 swami pernah berbicara di panggung tentang akibat dari penginjilan kristus yang sempat menghabiskan waktu di india bersama para filosuf yoga di tibet
3740219 nama isa sangat dihormati oleh buddhisme tetapi hanya pemimpin lama yang tahu banyak tentangnya yang telah membaca naskah tentang nabi isa kami memiliki banyak buddha seperti isa dan ada 84 000 naskah tetapi hanya sedikit orang yang membaca lebih dari seribu naskah
3740220 jika dibalik kehadiran buddha terkadang sulit untuk mengakui wujud mulia dari buddha sang guru maka cukup sulit untuk menemukan di pegunungan tibet kisah tentang kristus namun biara buddhis menyimpan ajaran kristus dan para lama mengetahui tentang kristus yang dijaga dan diajarkan
3740221 demikianlah legenda asia yang menceritakan gambaran tentang yesus begitu terkenal di hampir seluruh negeri dan asia menyimpannya di pegunungan sebagai legenda dan tidak mengejutkan jika ajaran yesus dan buddha menuntun bangsa bangsa menjadi satu keluarga memang indah bahwa gagasan tentang kesatuan begitu jelas digambarkan dan siapa yang menentang gagasan ini siapa yang akan mengurangi keputusan hidup yang sederhana dan indah ini dan kesatuan duniawi begitu mudah bersatu dalam kesatuan besar dari seluruh dunia perintah yesus dan buddha terletak dalam satu rak dan tulisan kuno sanskrit dan pali mempersatukan semua aspirasi

3740225 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3740226 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3740227 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3740228 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3740229 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs

3740234 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
3740235 we werent going to affiliate a third team this year
3740236 but the players themselves held a meeting and gave the commitment and its worked out well
3740237 we discussed where we want to go as a club we were in there trying to see where its all gone wrong for us our attitude cost us the game tonight our whole thing is wrong our focus is very poor to be honest im not sure if well get our focus back
3740238 we defended those chances well i thought we got lots of our guys behind the ball you always have to be cautious but especially so when youre guarding a four point lead
3740239 hard work won it for us today weve been working incredibly hard to get here that made the difference obviously i think the game itself was good you always do when you come out with a win hopefully this will stand to us in the championship
3740240 they wanted the match today more they showed hunger i dont want to take away anything from kilbrides performance they were aggressive and much more courageous than we were
3740241 hello excuse me where do you come from how long you in bangkok you stay here before
3740242 ok ok i sorry me first time inside your country i not understand your rules before

3740250 for those of you that smoke and first time visitors to bangkok there is an apparent
3740251 it was a big ask purely because of the timing of the game we had nothing left in the tank after playing for the previous four weeks five games in six weeks in fact with the final six days ago lasting for almost 100 minutes
3740252 it is no wonder guys were tired ad thats not even allowing for the celebrations after the final it wouldnt happen in any other sport be it professional or amateur
3740253 we are disappointed not to get a chance to play in the top tier next year but maybe its best to take small steps and compare ourselves to those in division 2 then we will know where we really are in hurling circles
3740254 all in all we are happy with our year our main aim to win the christy ring cup was achieved we need to push on from here and build on this years and our previous couple of years minor successes to stand still is to fall behind
3740255 sleep eat and drink hurling unable to summon the energy to play to their usual standard
3740256 know anything about hurling or maybe more to the point do they care
3740257 laois have some fine hurlers picked off some great scores and have been hurling at a higher level used that experience and the five minutes before half time were a killer
3740258 very happy with the year qualification for division 2 of the league and winning the ring cup surpassed my expectations i thought it might take a couple of years
3740259 the world may know that so far as we approve of monarchy that in america the law is king for as in absolute governments the king is law so in free countries the law ought to be king and there ought to be no other
3740260 weve worked extremely hard this season trying to keep the players as happy as possible throughout some tremendously testing times for the seconds to have reached the semi final in just their second year of competing is particularly pleasing for me and i genuinely believe that this could be the year for the firsts
3740261 the commitment and dedication that the players have shown throughout this season is what inspires me to continue doing what i do its the players that have put in the hard work theyre the ones who take to the field and put their bodies on the line week in week out the new lads like as anthony hennessy johnny butterworth and tommy luaki have all been decidedly influential throughout the course of the year and have really bolstered the strength of the squad
3740262 hes an exceptional motivator who knows how to get the most out of his players the fitness regimes and programmes that he puts in place are seriously demanding and its not uncommon for players to get sick at the end but at the same time the players generally enjoy it and the attitude and atmosphere is always superb
3740263 i went to meet jim greene to look at various issues
3740264 i felt a number of things were not handled correctly but then he got personal with me and i had to walk away i have never said anything to him since they carlow could have achieved more if they were not been run into the ground
3740265 it was brilliant for carlow to win the competition and also to step up to division 2 of the league friends of carlow would like to congratulate the lads on the win
3740266 but i wouldnt be happy as the lads have started training since last october and finished two weeks into august
3740267 the championship in carlow is only starting off now the county final will probably be played in the middle of the winter now
3740268 were prepared i wont say were confident but we know their strengths and weaknesses were ready to go
3740269 no to be honest i wish there was more support and recognition for the girls who play for their club
3740270 it was a very good championship most matches were very competitive this year
3740271 we never let ourselves get depressed five minutes to go youre 6 0 down and you say we can still win this 7 6 it was just a great atmosphere
3740272 wed be lucky to make the play offs i think well be in the top half but im hoping to make the play offs
3740273 ronaldo wouldnt have been able to play against them theyd have just flattened him and thats it
3740274 were two divisions higher than we were when i started supporting them so times are still good
3740275 there are a lot of stories about my part in the race and all of them are not true i did the hare for many races up to that but i can assure you that they took off at such a pace that the rest of us were chasing after that dont give me any credit for that i might have pushed them so that they kept ahead of me but i certainly didnt drag them to the record
3740276 the new zealand and australian runners were over for the empire games in cardiff so billy morton enticed them to dublin the stadium was packed to capacity there was no room standing or otherwise i was out early and the crowds were coming in morton asked me to warm up in the back field and i assured him that if herb elliot ronnie delaney and the rest were in the back field that i would go as well that sorted that out so we all warmed up on the main track
3740277 the first five across the line broke the four minute mile that night while the first four home broke the existing world record
3740278 second home was mervin lyncoln of australia the third was our own ronnie delaney and fourth home was murray halberg who went on to win the 5000 metres in the rome olympics he was interesting in that he used to play rugby but suffered an arm injury which meant that he couldnt play anymore and he got involved in athletics albert thomas who was fifth had broken the three mile record at santry stadium in july
3740279 we all talk about that miracle mile but the following night thomas broke the two mile record and halberg set a world best for the four miles over a five week period the one two three and four mile records had been set in santry
3740280 i was studying in dublin and was a member of crusaders athletic club i was fourth in the world wtudent games in 56 in 1957 i won the world student games in santry stadium and had beaten the other irish runner michael hoey who was in the race on the 6th august hoey went on to run for ireland in the 5000 metres in rome as well i had the privilege of captaining the irish team that year as well
3740281 i came back to carlow when my father died in july 1958 my studies ceased in bolton street and i came back to run the family business i continued to run for crusaders for a year but i was playing rugby then and it wasnt the best preparation for track running but it kept me fit
3740282 we had a wonderful evening on the 25th of july many of the runners were present but none of the overseas participants were able to attend the current rte commentator tony odonoghue michael connolly jim mcloughlin who came home from canada and of course ronnie delaney were there the actual commentator and announcer on the night liam brown was also in attendance we were presented with a cut glass vase we were a crowd of old has beens but better to have been a has been than a never was been
3740283 my real sport was spring board diving and swimming which took place at the barrow at the end of coxs lane that was where i won my first carlow under age championships i played gaelic football with the christian brothers and played minor football with milford where i had the honour of playing with the great cran hogan who died recently at castleknock college i was introduced to the foreign game of rugby the ban was in place at the time and i couldnt play gaelic rugby was my main sport then and i did continue with st laurence otooles for a while but never got back into the level that i had been at
3740284 every saturday morning paul lyons john clowry myself and a few others still meet and go for a 5 mile run it is more of a shuffle than a run but we do it nevertheless on sunday morning i take my little dog for a four mile run sometimes i get up to the rugby club and pretend

3740290 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3740291 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3740292 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3740293 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3740294 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3740295 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3740296 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3740297 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3740298 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3740299 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3740300 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3740301 ive been trying to keep quiet but i need to get one thing very clear larrabee is going to render directx and opengl games through rasterisation im not sure how the message got so muddled i think in our quest to just keep our heads down and get on with it weve possibly been a bit too quiet so some comments about exciting new rendering tech got misinterpreted as our one and only plan that has been the goal for the larrabee team from day one and it continues to be the primary focus of the hardware and software teams theres no doubt larrabee is going to be the worlds most awesome raytracer its going to be the worlds most awesome chip at a lot of heavy computing tasks thats the joy of total programmability combined with serious number crunching power but that is cool stuff for those that want to play with wacky tech were not assuming everybody in the world will do this were not forcing anyone to do so and we certainly cant just do it behind their backs and expect things to work that would be absurd
3740302 first graphics that we have all come to know and love today i have news for you our multi decade old 3d graphics rendering architecture thats based on a rasterization approach is no longer scalable and suitable for the demands of the future
3740303 beyond the teraflops why intel really put 80 cores on a single chip
3740304 ive been trying to keep quiet but i need to get one thing very clear larrabee is going to render directx and opengl games through rasterisation not through raytracing
3740305 ive been trying to keep quiet but i need to get one thing very clear
3740306 moi aussi jaime voyager comme les autres et je voyage mais contrairement ceux qui prennent le train moi je prends lavion
3740307 it is a sad situation in georgia and i would like to thank fifa for thinking about that and we will wait to see what fifa decide
3740308 i know that fifa will think about the calendar and for me it is important that the game will be played on september 6
3740309 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team
3740310 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
3740311 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it
3740312 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3740313 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3740314 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3740315 some say the devil is dead and buried in killarney more say he rose again and joined the

3740318 all countries that have hosted the olympic games have had problems with scalping we have noted that there are some people who have engaged in this sort of criminal activity and we are taking action against them
3740319 ill take basketball if youve got them pairs are best and athletics i need them if youve got em what are you after diving basketball
3740320 theyre nicking arresting down here a bit but were not getting too much trouble off them
3740321 they got to get you twice before you get planed deported thats what im hearing
3740322 you know drop a few notes on the floor and walk off and let them pick them up keeps everyone sweet doesnt it theyre not a problem her cops good as gold in fact
3740323 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3740324 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3740325 the fcc is appalled by this treatment of an accredited journalists within half a mile of the main olympic stadium
3740326 2 0 thing is way over the top at this point it seems like just about anything new with the web has to be 2 0 or its just not cool well bear with me on this
3740327 town of two hundred homes depended on the deforestation of as many as seventy five acres per year
3740328 most strikingly the new forecasts show inflation falling slightly below its 2 target at the two year policy horizon and then well below it thereafter a rather lower medium term profile than expected in may
3740329 were probably still not looking at cuts coming through until 2009 becuase there are serious near term upside risks to inflation
3740330 in terms of impact on interest rates i think its a firm on hold until we see this sharp slowdown that they are expecting in growth start to impact on the inflation rate
3740331 while we would not rule out a cut in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 until early 2009 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 by mid 2009 and to 3 75 by the fourth quarter of next year
3740332 we are getting crucified and i dont know why i cant tell you that
3740333 i cant believe some of the comments about phelps he is a supreme athlete its just a case of swimming appearing a bit boring to some people he has shown that he can rise to the top in many different types of race using different techniques in each where is the runner who can win the 100m 10 000m and hurdles its only running after all
3740334 it helps being positive nervous because youve been waiting four years for this i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster i raced as well as i could i cannot affect what others do theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3740335 if we have another consistent day today and tomorrow then i think well be set up to have some good medal races and ultimately get ourselves into a position in those medal races where were in the running to go for a medal
3740336 i am an ex international rower who has competed all over the world and also i have competed in triathlon what phelps is doing is extraordinary by any standard simon your comment that suggested swimming is one dimensional is rather questionable phelps is winning gold medals in various disciplines which require a completely different set of swimming skills to achieve if you have ever swam then you would know that the back stroke is the complete opposite to the freestyle the butterfly requires a completely different body movement through the water as does the breaststroke the fact that michael phelps has achieved such a complete all round perfection of the various strokes is in itself demonstrating what an outstanding athlete he is the fact that he is doing it winning gold medals and breaking world records is to me just wow i can only sit here in complete admiration to the discipline he has shown to achieve such heights just to highlight my point slightly more if carl lewis can win gold in 100m 200m 4x100m and a long jump does that not mean athletics is one dimensional as well as it is just all running in the end of the day or is it he was just an exceptional athlete who outclassed his peers
3740337 judging by medals alone is biased towards multi discipline events such as swimming and gymnastics 8 of the top 10 medal winners are either gymnasts or swimmers so calling phelps the
3740338 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again
3740339 if youre a good swimmer you have much more opportunity to win medals in the pool we have biathlons pentathlons and decathlons how about dodecathletes yes 20 disciplines lets see the swimmers enter the boxing ring the relay runners perform on the parallel bars the three day eventers shoots clay pigeons and the tennis players all pro play doubles badmington when will rugby league be an olympic sport so they can play full contact beach volley ball the olympics is a celebration of certain sports the competion is great and exciting a boxer can only win one medal but a swimmer can win 10 if his team mates are competent
3740340 i dont wish other readers to misunderstand of course i recognise and respect phelps achievements in the pool it just doesnt seem right to proclaim him greatest olympian in a very one dimensional discipline if pole vaulting had three diffferent run up distances and two types of pole material then undoubtedly sergei bubka wouldve earned about 18 golds in his career unfortunately he could win but one at each games as for greatest olympian what about fanny blankers coen a mother of two and aged 30 she won four golds on the track in 1948 and was prevented from entering long jump and high jump for which she held the world records maybe its the awful sycophantic commentary i have to endure here in hong kong that deters me from being more enthusiastic about phelps and his medal haul
3740341 phelps is an awesome athlete but swimming has far too many events attached to it with all the different strokes relays and medleys in track and field you do not have a gold medal for hopping side skipping and running backwards in high jump there are not three gold medals one for the flop one for the splits and one for the forward roll its a simple case of fastest highest end of story medal tables and individual medal tallies are artificially inflated and bias towards events in the pool and probably gymnastics too
3740342 why are we making a big deal about people winning golds in world record time havent they all been won in either an olympic or world record maybe the new thing should be sr speedo records
3740343 i think anyone who dedicates years of their life to just achieve the title an olympian deserves all the plaudits they get to mount that podium must be awesome and to do it 10 times is unbelievable i just wish i had a portion of the talent of these athletes
3740344 i have to disagree strongly about limiting an athlete to only one individual event it is the difference between the world championships and the olympics for the former event i agree that a limit could should be set but for the olympics it is precisely in the spirit of its history to find the worlds greatest olympian and that obviously cannot involve limiting an athlete to one single event
3740345 so what you are saying is that we should penalise the best athletes in the world because they are better than everybody else that makes absolutely no sense if phelps was british we would be right behind him michael phelps is going to go down as one of the greatest athletes and greatest olympians of all time and we should be applauding what he is doing not criticising him for it
3740346 i cant disagree more with the previous poster that said its not fair one person can go for so many golds i dont think anyone is fooled that in some disciplines theres more medals on offer but we have the opportunity for someone to do something quite special in this olympics if he gets it no one will fail to see what a remarkable champion phelps is
3740347 i am ex pat in melbourne and the tv coverage is predictably tedious endless commercials with some aussie medal hope squeezed in therefore relying on you for live updates of gbs chances i have a bet with an aussie colleague that gb will bag more golds so i am relying on you to deliver the booty
3740348 keep up the excellent coverage we dont get to see very much of the olympics over here in kazakhstan as we receive south african tv all they are interested in is rugby and the recent series defeat of england at cricket good to see they got beat by australia at the hockey
3740349 i am an expat watching live in the states keep the coverage coming and some of us are alive well amp watching by the way i am a happy ipswich fan after the carling cup win tonight also watching the red sox try to blow a ten run lead and they are doing a good job keep the faith
3740350 i am a brit currently working out in canada so the time difference is even worse i reckon on 11 hours from here to beijing my girlfriend and i are thouroughly enjoying all the coverage but its very annoying when we spot a team gb contestant and they move swiftly on
3740351 im a brit watcing the olympics from canada so thanks for keeping me up to date with the brits that are competing and arent getting to swimming finals and that are maybe finishing 17th in an archery tournament
3740352 i was gutted to see the french lose out by a fingertip in the relay the other day giving phelps another gold im fed up with all the hype surrounding this and in my opinion it highlights the ludicrous situation whereby one competitor can win so many medals competitors should be restricted to one individual event and as many team events as they choose then we would see a broader spectrum of swimmers more representative of that countries pool of talent pun intended
3740353 i am english but live and work in the philippines i just started work for the day 7 hours ahead of uk here and i have the live website up and running a great service i have to say there is little or no interest in the olympics here with the filipino nationals so not much tv coverage i am so pleased to have found your excellent website keep up the good work
3740354 we only get to see events in which an american has a medal chance and that is squeezed in between endless commercials oh how i would love to see some handball hockey or cycling
3740355 i take it not a lot is happening or are you still drinking your morning coffee to keep you awake

3740364 verantwortung zu bernehmen war eine unserer leitlinien bei der gr ndung von plusser de und zwar nicht nur f r unseren wirtschaftlichen erfolg sondern auch f r die gemeinschaft
3740365 vor allem der gedanke dass sich menschen direkt gegenseitig helfen hat uns an dieser aktion begeistert diese art des miteinanders ist auch einer der werte die wir mit unserem portal verwirklichen wollen
3740366 das projekt war uns von anfang an eine herzensangelegenheit denn zum einen halten wir diese konkrete art der hilfe vor ort f r den besten weg kulturelle grenzen zu berwinden und eine verbesserung der lage zu erreichen zum anderen fanden wir einfach gro artig was diese leute auf die beine gestellt haben welche m hen und risiken sie auf sich genommen haben um menschen in not zu helfen
3740367 es ist wirklich beeindruckend mit welchem mut und welcher leidenschaft diese leute in dem projekt stecken

3740369 bier kann hier abhilfe schaffen so ist der deutschen liebstes getr nk eine reichhaltige quelle nicht nur wegen der vielen mineralstoffe sondern auch durch die vielen b vitamine die aus dem malz und der bierhefe stammen

3740371 the fact that the first xcelligence systems have already been ordered before the official product launch shows that there is a real need for this new technology in cell analysis

3740373 angesichts des wirtschaftlichen h henflugs der lufthansa und des verzichts den die besch ftigten in schwierigen zeiten geleistet haben waren die erwartungen allerdings sehr hoch
3740374 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3740375 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3740376 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3740377 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years

3740420 for nature cannot comprehend god it is only the mercy of god that has the capacity to endow theosis unto the existing in theosis man the image of god becomes likened to god he rejoices in all the plenitude that does not belong to him by nature because the grace of the spirit triumphs within him and because god acts in him

3740447 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3740448 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3740449 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3740450 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie sic we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3740451 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3740452 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3740453 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3740454 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3740455 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3740456 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3740461 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3740462 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3740463 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3740464 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3740465 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3740466 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3740467 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3740468 as a seasoned executive for many years at aeterna zentaris prof engel has gained a deep knowledge of the companys activities at all levels we feel that his extensive expertise in drug development and commercialization as well as in strategic partnerships make him the ideal person to lead the company
3740469 i am thrilled with this new challenge and will continue to dedicate all efforts to the successful development of our deep pipeline especially the ongoing pivotal phase 3 program in benign prostatic hyperplasia with our lead compound cetrorelix
3740470 our relationship with bristol myers squibb is consistent with our strategy to work with global pharmaceutical leaders to expand the therapeutic potential of our leading rnai delivery technology at the same time this work compliments our internal product development initiatives as we advance our own rnai therapeutics to treat serious human diseases
3740471 we are extremely pleased to be able to license this compound from merck for further development and commercialization we are also pleased that orchid is partnering with us as a significant shareholder and developer of this compound leveraging its world class r amp d infrastructure in india this will allow diakron to fast track development of this unique anticoagulant product as its number one priority
3740472 despite recent advances there remains a significant unmet medical need for novel anticoagulant therapies
3740473 we believe that diakron is well positioned to build on our early development work and in collaboration with orchid spearhead the passage of this molecule through late stage clinical trials
3740474 we are delighted to have caxton advantage and hbm two premier health care funds lead this financing

3740476 we are excited about anthera and its late stage anti inflammatory platform we believe the companys lead candidate varespladib has demonstrated synergy with statins and represents a potential breakthrough treatment for people at risk for cardiovascular disease
3740477 we believe varespladibs unique mechanism of action will lead to improved patient outcomes and we look forward to its continued development
3740478 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl

3740492 we realized that amidst the gossip out there there were these little nuggets of inspirational gold that nobody was picking up and celebrating

3740494 we didnt expect anything like this when we started ecorazzi it was supposed to be just a small little project from a couple of green bloggers who had never met each other

3740496 we decided early on that the need existed to not only cover the environmental passions of those in the spotlight but also the other important philanthropic efforts underway good deeds and acts of charity occur in the entertainment industry all the time we thought it was time to create a site that truly addressed these initiatives on a day to day basis

3740562 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3740563 our members are facing the reality of a 5 inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs

3740576 our nation doesnt have a lot to offer all the brave soldiers in iraq who are doing hard dangerous work every day
3740577 but every once in a while we have the ability to take a snapshot in time to capture their valorous acts and reward them with a medal that theyre going to wear for the rest of their lives
3740578 i am actually proud i got the award and i am proud my fellow brothers were out here to support me in it
3740579 i am thankful that the bde cmdr was able to come out here and award it to me
3740580 it showed me that if there is one thing that i am proud of and if there is one thing that i am true to and if there is one thing that i am faithful to and will give my life for it is my soldiers
3740581 as a medic and now a sgt its an honor to work with these guys i will definitely put my life on the line for every one of these guys

3740591 i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement
3740592 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
3740593 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies
3740594 there is not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
3740595 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

3740667 the effect of cblis compound on limb recovery in our animal model of tourniquet induced injury is encouraging and the efficacy with which it protects warrants continued investigation
3740668 these results will allow us to project the potential use of this compound for multiple applications beyond tourniquet injury from kidney and heart ischemia to reducing the rapid inflammation normally observed in transplanted organs exploring all situations with similar mechanisms of tissue injury
3740669 the fact that protectan cblb502 demonstrated results even after the removal of a tourniquet could make it particularly practical for battlefield conditions or other types of civilian emergency use since it can be applied after an injured subject is delivered to the site of treatment

3740710 u spreekt met angela maas ik wil graag een rolstoeltaxi bestellen voor donderdag 14 augustus
3740711 dat kan mevrouw wat is uw pasnummer reist u alleen of gaat er nog iemand met u mee
3740712 de elektrische ligrolstoel waarin ik zelf al lig mijn hulphond en een douchestoel
3740713 dat zijn wel erg veel spullen mevrouw helaas mag en kan ik dat niet toestaan
3740714 waarom niet ik m et deze spullen mee nemen ik ben er van afhankelijk zonder deze spullen kan ik niet op vakantie
3740715 helaas mevrouw wij moeten ons houden aan deze regel want anders loopt het uit de hand mensen nemen namelijk vaak hun hele hebben en houwen mee met de taxi
3740716 maar ik ben er van afhankelijk zoals ik net al zei bovendien heb ik een machtiging voor solovervoer vanwege mijn lichamelijk toestand dus er is toch meer dan voldoende ruimte in de bus
3740717 ja dat begrijp ik mevrouw maar helaas moeten we ons toch aan die regel houden u heeft het trouwens over liggend vervoer dat doen wij niet dan moet u met speciaal vervoer
3740718 ik heb deze discussie al een aantal keer eerder gehad alle keren is het goed gegaan dus dat zal nu ook wel loslopen ik heb een gewone elektrische rolstoel maar ik lig daarin hij kan dus gewoon worden vastgezet maar neemt wat meer ruimte in beslag
3740719 nou ik zal het er allemaal bij zetten in de opdracht maar ik kan u niets garanderen hoor
3740720 kan het gewoon niet eens n keer allemaal goed gaan
3740721 voor ons is het geen probleem hoor ik hoop alleen niet dat ze moeilijk zullen doen als je opgehaald moet worden door een ander plaatselijk taxibedrijf
3740722 u heeft net een rit naar valkenburg geboekt en ik zie dat u met twee rolstoelen en een hulphond gaat reizen dit is nogal veel en is dan ook niet de bedoeling als u het foldertje van valys zou hebben gelezen had u geweten dat dit niet mogelik is
3740723 ja maar hoe moet ik dan op vakantie ik mag op mijn blote knietjes danken dat er zoiets bestaat als valys ik kan alleen niet mee nemen wat ik nodig heb tijdens mijn reis dan schiet het toch nog niet op ik mag wel 3 personen extra mee nemen als ik dat zou willen maar een douchestoel die bij mijn primaire levensbehoeften hoort is niet mogelijk volgens mij klopt er ergens iets niet in dit systeem of ligt dat aan mij
3740724 ja mevrouw ik begrijp uw frustraties maar ik kan er helaas niets aan doen deze regel is nu eenmaal gesteld en daar moeten wij ons aan houden hoe vervelend dat ook voor u is
3740725 helaas is het niet mogelijk om met zoveel spullen naar uw bestemming te reizen hoe laat denkt u terug te reizen
3740726 volgende week pas want ik ga er namelijk op vakantie
3740727 heeft u al enig idee om hoe laat u terug zou willen
3740728 ik wil graag om 19 30 uur opgehaald worden in het hotel in valkenburg gaat dat problemen opleveren
3740729 nou mevrouw ik heb goed nieuws voor u alles is geregeld maar all n voor deze ene keer want het is niet de normale gang van zaken
3740730 ik ga die naam cht niet gebruiken om af te zeiken of om op af te reageren ik wil graag persoonlijk rond de tafel het zij schriftelijk of telefonisch om eens wat knelpunten in het systeem op een rijtje te zetten
3740731 ja maar mevrouw die regels zijn er nu eenmaal en die kunnen niet worden veranderd
3740732 in dit wereldje zijn er maar weinig mensen die op eigen inzicht een beslissing durven te nemen wat maakt dat het hele gebeuren met regeltjes aan elkaar vast zit

3740752 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3740753 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3740754 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3740755 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3740756 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3740757 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3740758 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3740759 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3740760 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3740761 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3740762 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3740763 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3740764 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3740765 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3740766 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3740767 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3740768 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3740769 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3740770 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3740771 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3740772 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3740773 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3740774 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3740780 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3740781 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3740782 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3740783 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3740784 imagine what this world would be like today with total american influence
3740785 news reports revealed yesterday that turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdo an assured turkish cypriot officials especially the opposition during a visit to the north last month that g zelyurt would never be returned to greek cypriot control
3740786 as cypriot leaders are readying for comprehensive negotiations set for next month the town of g zelyurt in northwest cyprus will not be on the table as a bargaining chip for the turkish side
3740787 its not just an insult to me that i havent gotten a response from john kerry really its an insult to the people of massachusetts and also to the democratic process
3740788 john kerry should let me know ill do any number of debates hed like to do
3740789 hes playing politics and im for a democratic process we should have debates
3740790 john kerrys hoping to put this on the backburner and time to run out
3740791 i know what its like to work week to week and live week to week on a paycheck
3740792 my background is so different than john kerrys and i think the time has come that we need someone in the united states senate that really feels what its like to be a working class person
3740793 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3740794 e tbm de gente que vai pras baladas a noite beber pra achar que sabe curtir a vida
3740795 its degrading to have someone who just hired you to stick his hands down your pants
3740796 why didnt you turn around and knock him out right there
3740797 i knew what i was there for to pay my part of the bargain
3740798 the estimate we prepared was just what my manager was looking for
3740799 fortunately she has the budget approval to begin the work but she said that the budget is very tight and that we would have to complete the work within our original estimate
3740800 thats why i came to see you i know we put together a nice estimate based on a model but it was still just a model we havent done any conversions yet if the actual effort is more than we estimated we may be substantially over budget that could put the entire project in jeopardy
3740801 i think the first thing we need to do is validate the estimates
3740802 first identify a representative sample of databases large medium and small
3740803 migrate them to the new release and keep track of the effort and duration for each one then youll have some factual information to apply to the estimates and youll know if you should break out the champagne or the aspirin
3740804 nighbert or road contractor leonard lawson directed rummage to obtain the transportation cabinets engineers estimates on some occasions rummage delivered the engineers estimates to nighbert but on others he gave them directly to lawson on four of these times lawson gave rummage 5 000 cash for a total of 20 000

3740809 1980 was a referendum on ronald reagan was the country ready for reagan they were really unhappy with jimmy carter but they werent really sure about reagan
3740810 as if the country today is in the same situation it was in in 1979 and 1980 when the king of the useful idiots jimmy carter was running around appeasing the soviet union crashing helicopters in the desert while american hostages rotted in iran and showing up on tv wearing a cardigan sweater talking about
3740811 as if ronald reagan were not a former governor of the largest state in the country who had spent years touring the nation articulating his ideas but instead was a guy who thinks the greatest resume enhancements he can have is that he was a
3740812 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
3740813 the world has lost a bright spirit and a real human being
3740814 but instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english theyll learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual we should have every child speaking more than one language

3740830 news reports revealed yesterday that turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdo an assured turkish cypriot officials especially the opposition during a visit to the north last month that g zelyurt would never be returned to greek cypriot control

3740832 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3740833 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3740834 it was deemed that it was pretty unlikely that it would fix it that it would reoccur and if it did there was a chance he hurts it worse and its a much more involved surgery
3740835 the moment that i had today its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3740836 ive tried to enjoy every bit of this whole journey
3740837 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
3740838 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3740839 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day
3740840 the chinese womens gymnastics team made history today showing the world the china womens gymnastics team is the greatest
3740841 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3740842 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3740843 well i have no proof but one of the little girls has a missing tooth
3740844 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top
3740845 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road
3740846 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3740847 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3740848 i guess it was a little too hard to get out of the funk
3740849 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3740850 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3740851 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3740852 i wanted to convey that if you dont know jazz you can still sing along and enjoy it i wanted to make an album that was accessible to everyone
3740853 he always said why not just enjoy the song for the song
3740854 i want to reach out to those who are intimidated by jazz
3740855 it was time to experience what it meant to have a producer
3740856 lance had all of the qualities kate wanted in a mate
3740857 she throws herself into these relationships quickly then shes just over it
3740858 they just decided to end things theres no hatred just sadness
3740859 shes super need y and must be the center of someones attention
3740860 they were having problems and he ended it i think shes also still hung up on owen
3740861 but bretts had a girlfriend for three years brett and kate are just friends
3740862 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast
3740863 wont work lance already made it clear they are 100 percent done
3740864 they gave each other a kiss that lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
3740865 we save primarily from slaughter and rehabilitate re home wonderful horses and ponies
3740866 its really a group of people banding together to increase their purchasing power
3740867 you get this great food but what they really find is it brings them closer to their community
3740868 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3740869 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3740870 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3740871 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3740872 actually split christianity into dozens and then hundreds of different segments
3740873 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3740874 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3740875 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3740876 instructs the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3740877 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3740878 during the initial most difficult period you gave us a lot of strength and security
3740879 we will always fondly remember you and hope that our contact wont stop
3740880 no officer shall be out of radio contact with grafton county dispatch for more than three minutes without advising them by radio or telephone where he is and how he can be reached
3740881 to instruct forces to urgently overcome the consequences helping people stabilise life and keep updating damages
3740882 pakistan regrets the excessive use of force by indian security forces against the kashmiri people and calls for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
3740883 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3740884 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3740885 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3740886 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3740887 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3740888 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3740889 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3740890 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3740891 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
3740892 once i had to call 911 because he came over and collapsed in our front yard
3740893 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
3740894 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3740895 the wounded were lying on the ground men in military uniforms
3740896 everybody knew him this was his place for 30 years
3740897 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3740898 you could see lots of little fish about the size of sandals jumping out of the whales maw as it came out of the water
3740899 thats why were sure the whale is successfully and regularly feeding itself
3740900 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3740901 the chinese are keen to show they are in control they dont want to spoil the olympic party but there is no doubt this is a significant escalation
3740902 it is not just the quantity but the quality of the attacks that has changed they are becoming more dangerous
3740903 security should not become in any way a cover to try and deal with dissent
3740904 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid
3740905 we dont know that they were illegal if they were contributions from the campaign then obviously theres some issues there with legality but at this point were still trying to investigate that
3740906 and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate and you give it to a girlfriend of a god knows what thats a crime but the question is how do you prove that and she was somehow working for the campaign as its videographer so was the money she got so inappropriately more than what she deserved thats going to be the issue the feds are going to have to look at it would be a federal offense
3740907 because mr edwards told an untruth on national television and i think its unfortunate for the voters and for his family for rielle and her baby and i think somebody needs to advocate for her
3740908 was whisked away on a private jet two days before
3740909 has also confirmed that edwards secretly visited rielle and their love child three separate times at the beverly hilton hotel in los angeles this year enquirer reporters caught edwards 55 making a late night visit to 44 year old rielle and their daughter at the hotel on july 21
3740910 were sorry were sorry for the treatment were sorry for the suffering that youve been through
3740911 the entire state is with me today as i say this
3740912 were very grateful for you to come here and give us this message
3740913 it is difficult to say we are optimistic but we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
3740914 es ist ganz cool wenn man einmal gegen so eine kulisse k mpft

3740920 a private burial service for our children ben and catherine was held earlier today
3740921 it was our wish that the burial was held in private and we thank the media for respecting our privacy
3740922 we are currently making plans together for a funeral service which will allow extended family members friends and colleagues of ben and catherine to pay their respects
3740923 in the meantime the media are asked to continue to respect our wishes to be able to grieve in private and to try and come to terms with the terrible events of the past few weeks
3740924 haurien dhaver esperat una mica m s abans de prendre aquesta decisi
3740925 si volien un xit mundial els tinc tots aqu dins
3740926 suposo que volien un tema ben definit i avorrit quan tregui la meva versi i estic temptada de fer ho el mateix dia ser un xit
3740927 the incident happened at 5 30 in the morning our police team reached the spot the moment we received the information fire brigade was called and rescue operation began without delay till now 28 people have been taken out from the debris out of which 23 are injured and five have died as per the information that we have received
3740928 families who have lost their loved ones in the incident will be given rs one lakh and the ones who are injured will given compensation between 25 000 50 000 rupees as per the government s scheme enquiry will be conducted and legal action taken against people found guilty
3740929 today we are protesting against the order of taking back the land from the shrine board we have organised this road blockade for two hours
3740930 we are observing this protest called by the vhp to support the amarnath sangarsh samithi
3740931 well unfortunately we are all a bit suspicious that this is actually a smoke screen to actually keep the judges out and actually play for time because this impeachment could be a drawn out process and in that there is an equal chance that musharraf might survive that because there are only about 10 members of parliament that need to go on the other side for this whole impeachment effort to fail
3740932 it would be a straightforward thing of immediately annulling nullifying musharraf s election as the president while he was still the army chief
3740933 so therefore if the judges were restored then musharraf would go but they the ruling coalition are not restoring the judges and instead going the wrong way round
3740934 he zardari has been given amnesty off all his corruption cases worth billions of dollars and in return the quid pro quo is that zardari saves musharraf and rather than getting the judges reinstated if he were sincere he would just get the judges reinstated who are still the constitutional judges of pakistan but he is stalling on that he is making every excuse not to get the judges back
3740935 our history shows that once the army chief retires which musharraf did last november then it s case of the king is dead long live the king and they serve their own institution i don t think they are going to stand by him
3740936 i find the whole thing quite strange that the isi is supposed to be patronizing these militants on the other hand these militants have been killing not just the soldiers and police but actually they have blown up two isi buses killing isi personnel right in the heart of the ghq in pindi
3740937 in my opinion what is a more accurate picture is that the militant groups that were trained by the cia and isi during the afghan jihad against the soviets and who after the soviet occupation the groups that were used by isi in kashmir and afghanistan they have gone out of control or the ideological element in these groups has gone out of control because they were indoctrinated to fight foreign occupation
3740938 they backed one man against 160 million people and they kept backing him right through all the unconstitutional acts he kept doing they still kept backing him they backed him they paid lip service to him that he shouldn t have imposed the emergency but when the illegal and unconstitutional election was announced they quickly backed him again
3740939 the us standing with the military dictator has actually harmed the image of the us it has raised anti americanism in our country because here the people who were watching a military dictator using the army to kill their own people
3740940 now it is the most rugged mountainous terrain so for any pakistan head of state giving any guarantees to the us that they will be able to stop these tribes half are on one side of the border half are on the other side and there is no border there s never been a border the way to have tackled it was through dialogue through winning the tribesman over to their side
3740941 the tribes have nothing to do with al qaeda or taliban they should have won them over to their side rather than indiscriminately bombing them aerial bombing bombs not knowing or differentiating between women children and terrorists and the collateral damage pushing the tribes on to the other side and it s a huge mess being created their and they need to change strategy
3740942 my advice is that they need to change strategy we don t want more of the same it s a failed strategy and my advice to them is to study the rand corporation report that says that only eight percent of terrorist conflicts have been resolved through military terrorism is an idea you don t win this war on terror if you don t win the hearts and minds of people the more people die the more people join the terrorists

3740944 you declare the way you are voting when you walk into a voting booth
3740945 it would be very hard to prove that there was concerted effort to get democrats to vote in a republican primary or vice versa even if you could prove that i dont see its illegal
3740946 i dont mean that a penguin will suddenly think hes napoelon but do penguins ever just get fed up with their colonies and leave
3740947 i got caught with my pants down on quite a few
3740948 we do see modest increases in loan modifications occurring which i think is stunning
3740949 but it is not keeping pace with foreclosures and defaults
3740950 the lenders still just have their heads in the sand
3740951 if you didnt have declining prices then people could just sell their home or refinance to avoid foreclosure
3740952 we keep hearing about people who can afford to pay their mortgage but who walk away instead
3740953 its not an option you can walk away from based on whether a home appreciates in value
3740954 when people voluntarily leave their homes they add more houses to the inventory it also causes tighter lending standards which makes mortgages harder to get
3740955 seven years of bad credit is a long time not only in the life of a family but in the real estate cycle

3741021 as many as eight of our players are being regularly called up to national teams and we also had very tough matches against austria wien in the uefa cup but i do not agree we are playing badly we still have ten games ahead including home fixtures against leaders aktobe and irtysh
3741022 i am not afraid to say that kaisars success has everything to do with conscientious work by the players and coaches sensitive attention from the board and local authorities plus high morale
3741023 i took charge midway through the season the team were used to playing with three men at the back while i prefer four the way the national team plays so the lads needed time to get used to that we also are very poor finishers and squander a lot of chances still we have to do our best to climb as high as possible
3741024 i insisted that we buy new players but unfortunately the board could not meet my demands
3741025 the team are still hopeful that we can stay in the top flight

3741032 i keep them all alive still until i say differently im going to keep them all alive
3741033 i like all three quarterbacks i cant stress that enough i feel good about all three of them alex smith obviously is a starter a healthy starter anyhow at seven and five and shaun hill last year in his two starts he had he was 2 0 so i know they both can win games i feel confident in both of them j t is the newest product to what weve got so im getting a longer look at him
3741034 im encouraged by what alex has done as well as in the game i thought alex showed a little more calmness in the huddle he got flushed a time or two but nonetheless hes done a nice job the last few days as well
3741035 im going out there trying to play as well as i can play thats the starter not my decision to make so its not something i feel about
3741036 im going out there trying to play as well as i can with every chance and let the decision makers make the decisions
3741037 i try not to think about that or read into anything right now
3741038 i try not to think too much about it i think the more you do that the more its going to hurt you out in the field with your play
3741039 i really dont know how to answer some of these questions i really dont
3741040 i wish we were a little more in the light on things but thats how it is i guess
3741041 we are all just trying to get a feel for the playbook the plays the concepts we are putting in the types of things we are trying to do and how we are trying to attack defenses which is unique in this system
3741042 im trying to get a feel for that the timing and the decision making is the biggest thing
3741043 what we do on certain looks and having to be versatile a ball can come out so fast on one play but on the same play just a different look its a seven step drop and you are going down the field so just trying to get used to that and ready for the season
3741044 we are trying to push it a little bit and see what we can do what plays we cant make i think its a good thing if you want to reach your potential and reach excellence youve got to be able to do that you cant play with fear or hesitancy or worrying about making a mistake you have to cut it loose
3741045 when you go out there and get a chance to play in a real game and you make the corrections after watching the film its great to get out there again and get to compete
3741046 you get to make the corrections so that youre improving and see what you did wrong so that you dont do that again
3741047 heavy tech discussion on how we can make all our systems open to each other
3741048 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3741049 you cant make excuses like yesterday the defense got the best of it said quarterback j
3741050 thats just not good enough you have to immediately learn why and what happened we cant let it happen again we have got to come out and have a good day like we did today and build on it from there thats the part that everybody wants to see the resilience how are you going to handle things when things dont go perfectly
3741051 they were slowing down after jumping offsides so i think we looked at it as our time to score
3741052 he threw it up and i just went up and got it thats a great way to end practice the offense came out today and executed a lot better and we just looked like a much better and more precise unit today than we did yesterday
3741053 whether its arnaz battle or ashley lelie or bryant johnson with jason hill as a fourth they are nicked up
3741054 but as weve already seen josh morgan would not have gotten noticed if they hadnt and hes done a very good job
3741055 we didnt have a great practice yesterday so we wanted to come out and put that behind us we had a good tempo not too many mental errors and in the two minute drill its all about executing and scoring points we did that
3741056 we made sure that we cleaned that up and told the free safety to make sure he moves so we dont have that happen again
3741057 we worked on our block schemes our pressure looks our go calls and then our safe look we are just trying to tune all that up and get everybody on the same page
3741058 andy lee is a great holder and brian jennings is a great snapper theres nothing to worry about when i go out there other than kicking the ball
3741059 that was my first time ever blocking a kick i was excited
3741060 it was a low kick but if you look at the field goal blocks from last year half of them were based on them getting it off a little low and our guys getting their hands up
3741061 thats taking points off any time you can put pressure on force a miss force a hurry up get a block and take points off or get a block pick it up and score thats a big turnaround thats real important to us with the 49ers
3741062 adam snyder and joe staley like calling me that coming from cal they are the bears but plus im kind of getting scruffy here at camp by not shaving
3741063 just like a bear he likes to sleep and eat salmon
3741064 i went in mid second quarter and then finished the game so i got quite a bit of playing time
3741065 my parents my sisters and my girlfriend came up it was good that they got to see my first game and it was fun to have them there
3741066 it was a fun atmosphere i got the first game jitters out of the way i wished we could have come out with a win but i felt like i played well and gained confidence
3741067 we went to a bowl game every year i was there and that was fun
3741068 the football program was just progressively getting better my best memories are the friendships i made and being able to have success in football
3741069 its a game of technique at o line and coach warhop is very strict on using the right technique every time
3741070 when you get the right technique down you dont get beat and thats the goal everyone is trying to achieve when they get all fired up its because theyre passionate about it and they want you to succeed which is a motivator for me
3741071 thats the starting point you get a play and you think about what kind of technique youre going to use all through camp
3741072 its hard trying to learn the right techniques its coming but i still have to learn a lot
3741073 well first and foremost i want to make the team
3741074 i want to contribute whether its special teams or on kickoff return or backing up whatever way i can so im going to continue to work on my technique continue learning the offense and just keep getting better and hopefully that will line me up to be on the squad
3741075 the 80 degree water at the sportsplex no longer feels cold
3741076 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio

3741078 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
3741079 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions
3741080 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
3741081 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly

3741085 according to a congressional sportsmens foundation poll to be released wednesday john mccain leads obama by a 45 to 31 percent thats only about half the 27 point edge respondents say they gave george w bush over kerry four years ago and far short of the 65 to 15 percent margin gun owners gave to bush over gore in 2000
3741086 one of the big questions that i had was that of why the council was being charged so much to have the recyclable material collected i contacted over one hundred companies in the recycling business and established the best prices available for each of the materials taken at our civic amenity sites i also visited six recycling centres around the country both private and public in order to establish what was being done elsewhere i also found out what tonnages were being dealt with at our two now three sites from this it became quite obvious that the council was getting very bad value for money
3741087 it was because of this that i requested more detailed information on what we were paying for the service i thought that this would be no problem at all however that was not to be the case i was informed that the information was commercially sensitive and that i could not have it
3741088 a two day junket to the sliabh russell hotel the purpose of the junket was a sort of bonding session between the staff and the councillors at one of our sessions i brought up the issue of not being able to access information which i believed could save the council significant sums of money i explained to the room full of staff and councillors that i would need the information in order to establish whether or not we were wasting money i also made it clear that the figures were not for sending to the press instead of support i was met with protests from two fine gael councillors stating that it would be inappropriate for me to be given such information
3741089 with much persistence i eventually got the information which i was entitled to subsequently on my request the council put the job out for tender again i then carried out an analysis of the viability of the council doing the baling and recycling itself included in this was a survey which i carried out to establish what was the potential to broaden even further the range of recyclables being taken i gave a presentation to the environment committee and waited to see what happened i have never been given a formal response to the study however soon after this the council tendered again for the sites this time i believe it has got a good deal the question is would it have if it was not forced on it
3741090 i am not at all a bit feeling sorry for what i did id do it again
3741091 this information from the cso bucks the widely held belief that many migrant workers will leave ireland for other eu countries as our economy slows down and that a large proportion of new jobs being created in ireland will be taken up by the irish workforce
3741092 the biggest share of new jobs are being created in high value sectors like financial and other business services which grew by 26 300 in the year to the first quarter of 2008 and accounted for almost half 48
3741093 this trend needs to be fully researched by government as it could well be a warning about irelands ability to attract foreign direct investment
3741094 some of this is as a result of the increasing cost of childcare as two thirds of the jobs created in the 12 month period were part time and 70 of these jobs were taken up by women migrant women have a lower dependency ratio and as a result are in a better position to take up employment
3741095 but the more worrying concern is that this is partly a result of the governments failure to properly re skill our indigenous workforce to compete for these growth areas in employment this trend cannot be ignored and it is imperative that the government acts now rather than sitting on its hands
3741096 more migrants moving up the value chain will certainly benefit the economy but if it continues without being properly evaluated we could be skilling other economies to facilitate the transfer of jobs from ireland
3741097 each stone that is placed on the summit will signify a cancer patient who had surgery at sligo general hospital in the previous 12 months
3741098 we are hoping that a big contingent of people will join us in this sponsored walk they will be helping the campaign for the rights of those same patients and their families as well as raising much needed funds for shout sligo hospital oncology unit trust
3741099 this sponsored climb is the first of a series of highprofile events to raise awareness of the implications of government and hse plans to scrap cancer services at sligo general hospital
3741100 if they thought we were going to go away they are very much mistaken this is just the first in a series of events that we plan to stage we wont rest until sligo general hospital is confirmed as one of the countrys cancer centres of excellence
3741101 this is excellent news today for athlone and for ireland this investment will bring further new high quality employment opportunities to the region and is another superb overseas medical technologies company choosing ireland for its future growth and development
3741102 the midlands record of success with companies in the medical technologies industry the availability of a highly skilled workforce and the proximity to the athlone institute of technology with its highly educated graduates in engineering and science disciplines are not just major attractions to abiomed but to many other innovative driven multinational companies of the same calibre
3741103 we chose this ireland location because it simply met our primary criteria a great building with existing clean room space a great workforce and a strong supplier network
3741104 this is a welcome and very timely boost to the local economy and sends out a strong message that the midlands is open for business with foreign direct investment
3741105 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind

3741113 online consumers at risk and the role of state attorneys general
3741114 the most aggressive online enforcers setting an example for others to follow
3741115 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished
3741116 we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem through committed action and vigorous enforcement they can provide a powerful and much needed deterrent
3741117 the sword of justice can prevail in the virtual world
3741118 our consumer protection division remains at the center of the cybercrime combat zone because weve strengthened our forces and armed ourselves with the best investigative tools and legislation
3741119 a huge threat to consumers as well as to the future of online commerce

3741135 my family were always saying to me that i would make a good escort for the rose of tralee my aunt maura got a form so i filled it out and was called to an interview in dublin a few months ago i got word a few weeks ago that i had been picked i was delighted its going to be an experience of a lifetime
3741136 they told us to make sure we get plenty of sleep the week before because we will have to assist the roses and be by their sides at all of the events such as going to the various balls and the races for example
3741137 ive been getting so much slagging in the past week we were dressed up for the photo shoot in dublin and the photos were in the star last week so everybody in work has been calling me the great gatsby since im really looking forward to tralee though so i think it will be worth all of the slagging in the end
3741138 last year we had a walk through st johns wods which was very successful and well supported but this year we decided to do something different and to take a look back on national schools in the area
3741139 at the moment we have a lot of school books from the classics to others such as the penny catechism from the 1920s and 30s era which the older members of the community will remember and we also have other items such as ink wells and bottles and even a game of ludo which dates back to the 1930s but we are still inviting members of the community to loan or donate items for this exhibition
3741140 this exhibition will be of interest to anyone with an interest in old school records certificates and memorabilia even if thay have no connection with the area theyll have shared the same books and experience

3741142 once again the committee was very concerned with the overcrowding taking place in castlerea prison the cell population for the prison is 215 but during the year there was a high of 253 in custody which put enormous pressure on both staff and prisoners who ended up sleeping on mattresses on the floor
3741143 the remand prisoners of which there are 20 places hit an all time high during the year of 63 the committee is aware of the new remand unit to be operational in 2008 and it is hoped this would relieve the pressure that was put on spaces in 2007
3741144 it was decided that he should be released into a high support residential accommodation where supervision of medication would take place however when it came to his release date there was no place available for him and only at the very minute a place was made for him
3741145 this just highlights the problems facing the prison service and the committee feels there should be more liaison within all the different departments to avoid any problems in the future
3741146 very high level of interest in the classes provided with some classes been over subscribed
3741147 i think the public is probably unaware that many of the chemicals they use around their homes or the pharmaceuticals they take themselves ultimately end up in the natural environment and are very difficult to handle
3741148 we really dont know what the long term effects of these things are in the environment some are persistent and dont break down
3741149 rgdata is not opposed to developments that will assist the vitality and vibrancy of town centres and we respectfully suggest that there are altrernative sites in ballaghaderreen which could be appropriate for this proposed development these sites are nearer to the hub of local facilities and would create opportunities to enhance the vitality of the town
3741150 our clients have serious reservations regarding the development as proposed and the negative impact that it could have on the development of the town and its commercial core
3741151 unnecessary sprawl of a major retail use outside the designated town centre area
3741152 the site of the proposed development is not effectively connected to the existing town centre and does not cater for a local neighbourhood catchment therefore it will compete with the town centre and not create synergies within same
3741153 should favourable consideration be forthcoming on this application it will serve as a disincentive to investors in the town centre which will have an adverse impact on the devleopment of same

3741162 we are a little behind schedule and we now expect to be fully completed and off the site by early october

3741167 we dont know exactly which gene it is but were getting close
3741168 this basically provides a validation for a huge body of socio biology
3741169 no perch sono convinto che arriveranno giocatori forti e ci faranno comodo completeranno la rosa per un campionato lungo e mi fido totalmente di chi gi c vedrete di che pasta sono fatti
3741170 e vero ma abbiamo vinto delle partite anche senza di lui il resto della squadra rimasto salvo giuly che poteva farci comodo la societ deve poter lavorare tranquilla nel rispetto delle regole interne facendo del proprio meglio sul mercato
3741171 anche stamani abbiamo sorriso e sorrideremo pure domani per ci fa piacere che francesco domani possa tornare a darci una mano in campo lintenzione quella
3741172 suazo uno che avevamo visto un anno fa e che conosciamo bene abbiamo sotto tiro una serie di nomi valuteremo strada facendo chi pu fare al caso nostro
3741173 quando a un calciatore vengono offerti pi soldi va altrove
3741174 dice prad prad se vuole glielo lo faccio vedere dalla finestra cinque minuti fa era nel corridoio
3741175 parto sempre dal presupposto della disponibilit al lavoro ci presenteremo allinizio della stagione nelle condizioni ottimali e chiaro che nellambito del campionato bisogna fare attenzione a completare la rosa ma la squadra che ha ottenuto tutti questi grandi risultati negli ultimi anni questa qui tranne mancini e poi vucinic il valore aggiunto ha delle grandi potenzialit lavete scritto anche tutti voi
3741176 su doni sono stato tranquillizato dal medico per la supercoppa sar pronto poi per i dettagli nella roma lavorano dei professionisti chiedete a brozzi sul vice doni artur per ora non lo conosciamo ancora approfonditamente stiamo valutando delle situazioni di mercato prenderemo in considerazione alcune cose che vanno analizzate in profondit pu essere che servir un quarto portiere la stiuazione che stiamo vivendo pu esserci dinsegnamento
3741177 non lo so chiaro che se c qualcuno che ti crea difficolt che usa il nome della roma bene farci attenzione gurdate i procuratori di ciss e nen sfruttano la roma perch non sono giocatori che non abbiamo mai richiesto e che non ci interessano invece voi dite di s ci sentiamo presi per il naso e non ci va bene
3741178 lho vista ha fatto una buonissima partita al di l del potenziale dellavversario ha dato continuit a quanto espresso lanno scorso ha una rosa importante per le prime quarto posizioni
3741179 non sono queste le partite che indicano il valore delle squadre sappiamo quali sono gli organici competitivi milan juve e inter li hanno di primordine sono tutte in lotta per lo scudetto e per la champions lippi ci ha fatto dei complimenti importanti che ci fanno piacere parla cos perch conosce i nostri giocatori per essere alla pari dellinter servirebbe un allenatore come lui
3741180 a un elemento di quel calibro gli ci vuole poco giocatori cos sanno inserirsi subito
3741181 s se arrivano allultimo per poi ce lo devono dimostrare sul campo di essere dei giocatori importanti
3741182 i miei colleghi per arrivare fin qui meritano rispetto sar cos pure per mourinho non entro per nel merito delle polemiche
3741183 alberto sta facendo bene si sta allenando intensamente in questa prima parte di allenamenti dedicata alla fatica lho visto con le intenzioni giuste ed la cosa pi importante alberto lo conosco bene in tutte le posizioni del campo
3741184 ci ho vinto una coppa con questo modulo sviluppando risulatati in partite importanti e che non ci fa stravolgere i ruoli dei giocatori permette di aumentare il quantitativo di palloni a centrocampo in base alle caratteristiche dei nostri giocatori ti d dei vantaggi nellimpostazione del gioco e un modulo che conosco bene
3741185 forse quello che gli capitato un po di tempo fa gli lasciato qualche segno magari meno tranquillo ma non nervoso philippe vuole mettere in campo questa sua aggressivit e ci sta a volte di oltrepassare il limite e di sconfinare nel nervosismo e una carica nervosa che gli viene richiesta sempre nel rispetto degli avversari comunque se ne parla tra di noi e i giocatori trovano la soluzione sempre da soli
3741186 creer disturbio ma dar pure dei vantaggi alla societ per la maggiore visibilit che viene data alla squadra domenech ha preso coscienza dellimportanza di mexes e un segnale che phil deve saper sfruttare
3741187 sicuramente s un allenatore deve stare attento a sfruttare le caratteristiche dei giocatori per metterli a proprio agio
3741188 bisogna completare la rosa vediamo quello che ci sta succedendo con dei giocatori che non si pososno schierare il momento difficile ci pu sempre capitare ci star sempre di vincere o perdere ma cercando di offrire una buona prestazione
3741189 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3741190 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3741191 when modeling species distributions it is important to consider a large amount of climatic data and evaluate the methods used especially when dealing with important issues such as invasive species whose ecological limitations may not be immediately obvious
3741192 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
3741193 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
3741194 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
3741195 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
3741196 liberias wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized
3741197 this conflict has been characterized by ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population between 1989 and 1997 and again in 2003 and 2004
3741198 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
3741199 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
3741200 rehabilitation programs that do not address this specific population risk failing a critically vulnerable group
3741201 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3741202 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3741203 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys
3741204 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3741205 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3741206 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3741207 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3741208 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3741209 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3741210 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3741211 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3741212 opportunities for integrating ecological restoration amp biological conservation within the ecosystem approach
3741213 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3741214 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention

3741218 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language

3741230 zum beispiel heute nachmittag habe ich meine gr sste liebe getroffen
3741231 nein julia julia war die gr sste und sie war toll aber sie kommt einfach nicht weiter als ich sie heute getroffen hab sie war so n chtern und objektiv absolut abstossend
3741232 ich w rde sagen sex ist die kulmination von allem
3741233 ich meine ich bin sowieso einsam und ich m chte mir meinen tag nicht versauen lassen von einer hysterischen claudia die neben mir sitzt und eine zigarette nach der anderen raucht ich meine ich bin jetzt ber vierzig
3741234 sie hat mir immer ausf hrlich ber alle ihre liebhaber auskunft gegeben
3741235 weisst du ich lernte sie kennen da war meine mutter gestorben meine mutter war gestorben und sie war meine g ttin sie war meine g ttin und sie hatte einen freund
3741236 ich habe sie in den 90ern kennengelernt und sie kam aus einem total verkorksten ost elternhaus sp ter wurde mir das gewahr weil sie hat was devotes
3741237 ich sag nur kriegsversehrt blablabla dann sp t noch ne frau kennengelernt ich sag nur sp t erstgeborener ich bin da sehr neurotisch
3741238 es totalmente lamentable el papel que anda haciendo el presidente fox y con todo respeto a fox anda haciendo el papel de pelele quien le puede creer a un pelele

3741243 you need to shut your fucking dogs up theyve been barking for the last hour you dumbasses need to do something
3741244 whats the worlds greatest moral challenge as judged by its capacity to inflict human tragedy it is not i think global warming whose effects if they become as grim as predicted will occur over many years and provide societies time to adapt a case can be made for preventing nuclear proliferation which threatens untold deaths and a collapse of the world economy but the most urgent present moral challenge i submit is the most obvious global poverty
3741245 there are roughly 6 billion people on the planet in 2004 perhaps 2 5 billion survived on 2 a day or less says the world bank by 2050 the world may have 3 billion more people many will be similarly impoverished
3741246 whats baffling and frustrating about extreme poverty is that much of the world has eliminated it in 1800 almost everyone was desperately poor but the developed world has essentially abolished starvation homelessness and material deprivation the solution to being poor is getting rich its economic growth we know this the mystery is why all societies have not adopted the obvious remedies
3741247 just recently the 21 member commission on growth and development including two nobel prize winning economists former prime ministers of south korea and peru and a former president of mexico examined the puzzle since 1950 the panel found 13 economies have grown at an average annual rate of 7 percent for at least 25 years these were botswana brazil china hong kong indonesia japan south korea malaysia malta oman singapore taiwan and thailand some gains are astonishing from 1960 to 2005 per capita income in south korea rose from 1 100 to 13 200 other societies started from such low levels that even rapid economic growth combined with larger populations left sizable poverty in 2005 indonesias per capita income averaged just 900 up from 200 in 1966 still all these economies had advanced substantially the panel identified five common elements of success openness to global trade and usually an eagerness to attract foreign investment political stability and capable governments committed to economic growth though not necessarily democracy china south korea and indonesia all grew with authoritarian regimes high rates of saving and investment usually at least 25 percent of national income economic stability keeping government budgets and inflation under control and avoiding a broad collapse in production a willingness to let markets allocate resources meaning that governments didnt try to run industry
3741248 a second is outside benevolence cant rescue countries from poverty there is a role for foreign aid technical assistance and charity in relieving global poverty but it is a small role it can improve health alleviate suffering from natural disasters or wars and provide some types of skills but it cannot single handedly stimulate the policies and habits that foster self sustaining growth japan and china to cite easy examples have grown rapidly not because they received foreign aid but because they pursued pro growth policies and embraced pro growth values
3741249 the hard question which the panel ducks is why all societies havent adopted these lessons one reason is politics some regimes are more interested in preserving their power and privileges than in promoting growth but the larger answer i think is culture as lawrence harrison of tufts university argues traditional values social systems or religious views are often hostile to risk taking wealth accumulation and economic growth in his latest book the central liberal truth harrison contends that politics can alter culture but it isnt easy globalization has moral as well as economic and political dimensions the united states and other wealthy countries are experiencing an anti globalization backlash americans and others are entitled to defend themselves from economic harm but many of the allegations against globalization are wildly exaggerated today for example the biggest drag on the u s economy the housing crisis is mainly a domestic problem by making globalization an all purpose scapegoat for economic complaints many progressives are actually undermining the most powerful force for eradicating global poverty

3741270 and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
3741271 this is a true saying and everyone should believe it christ jesus came into the world to save sinners and i was the worst of them all
3741272 that others will realize that they too can believe in him and receive eternal life

3741290 but the children who are being born with the aid of dolphins at least with the cases documented in russia are extraordinary children most of the have iqs of over 150 genius range again plus extremely stable emotional bodies and strong physical bodies they are superior in one way or another
3741291 giving birth in the red sea with the dolphins was the most wonderful experience of my life
3741292 i was in complete control of the situation and didnt feel under any pressure to perform as you do in a hospital with the doctors and nurses milling about
3741293 it happened so quickly and i wasnt in any pain the dolphins came close but not too close it felt like they wanted their presence to be known but didnt want to be too intrusive
3741294 my only reservation was that while i was in labour i didnt have the option of hospital facilities if i needed them
3741295 the fact that one woman gave birth in the sea with dolphins made the trip worthwhile
3741296 women feel safe when theyre in the water with dolphins these wonderful mammals understand joy at a very deep level swimming with them enables a prospective mother to be in touch with joy which is the true essence to birth hospitals tend to turn the birth of a child into an organized sanitized affaire over which the professionals rather than mothers have control

3741302 we calculated our rankings by measuring how tied attendance figures were to winning percentage since 1991 and we discounted expansion teams that have come along since through the use of multiple regression analysis we determined how quickly fans supported the team when they started winning and how quickly they dissipated once performance slumped the faster that fans boosted attendance and the more hastily they abandoned poor performance indicated fans who were less loyal

3741340 there are a lot of unsigned artists out there who want to get their music exposed to the world but there is currently no outlet targeted for independent artists on a worldwide scale as this via the internet artists can upload their music and get it heard by millions instantly effectively giving them the much needed exposure

3741342 e mia opinione ha commentato un poco divertito il sergente di polizia david cameron che ci faccia molto male e lascer dei traumi e come tirare addosso ad una persona un pesante blocco di ghiaccio
3741343 ce lho messa tutta ha detto berto ma davanti a dio non me la sono sentita di mentire quella persona negli ultimi tempi mi aveva creato molti problemi
3741344 i consider it a victory because it does show that the process works
3741345 i hope it does not take a concession of error every time for a writ to be successful
3741346 while serving in the virginia general assembly the attorney general supported the legislation that created the current writ of actual innocence
3741347 the courts decision today demonstrates that the criminal justice system works this law has made the system even stronger
3741348 over the last year we have heard a lot of greenwash unsubstantiated marketing claims about how new it products are doing their bit to protect the environment
3741349 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3741350 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3741351 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3741352 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3741353 a private burial service for our children ben and catherine was held earlier today
3741354 it was our wish that the burial was held in private and we thank the media for respecting our privacy
3741355 we are currently making plans together for a funeral service which will allow extended family members friends and colleagues of ben and catherine to pay their respects
3741356 it is the families intention for the media to be facilitated at this service details of which will be confirmed in due course
3741357 in the meantime the media are asked to continue to respect our wishes to be able to grieve in private and to try and come to terms with the terrible events of the past few weeks
3741358 were about bringing new voters into the political process and its in our interest to run the tightest program we can
3741359 you know jesus i know jesus too whoa only one degree of separation
3741360 sometimes we dont know the importance when we go out to invite people to come to bible study
3741361 sometimes we think this is wasting time this guy had no idea who i was
3741362 just to stop and think for a minute about announcing your christianity you feel sick immediately because its crazy
3741363 youre not just saying goodbye to a religion to a tradition
3741364 suddenly you are starting from scratch and canceling everything you have in society
3741365 but when it started i was ready for any circumstances i thought about the worst conditions that could happen as consequences after my announcement but and i tell you this is a miracle this is how god works you carry the cross and rely on him completely and he takes care of everything
3741366 this may be the first case that a well known muslim just goes to the public and says i am a christian
3741367 many muslim sheiks many muslim imams may be converted to christianity but they keep that a secret they didnt announce it because it is very embarrassing for them and for their families they were afraid for their lives
3741368 but i decided to declare jesus in front of the world so he declares me in front of the father
3741369 that was the main reason i am going to be just worshiping god in a very special way by doing this
3741370 when jesus says carry your cross and follow me it wasnt to put a cross on your shirt and keep walking the street
3741371 i have met politicians i have met presidents and prime ministers i have met all the leaders of that region
3741372 none of them have a magical solution for this issue they are leading people but they dont know where they are going
3741373 even if they have a way out of this endless circle of violence between the two nations none of them have the courage to do it
3741374 both sides have many parties and every party has its own agenda there are no strong leaders in that region who can make brave decisions
3741375 jesus is not going to give them a political solution but he has changed me and he can change those people to a better people he can teach them how to forgive how to love
3741376 everybody on both sides is hurt not only israelis not only palestinians if we can teach them how to forgive and move on and love their enemies for the next two generations we can build a new leadership for both sides to be able to live together
3741377 now as it is there is no hope for them but jesus its that simple
3741378 when tesla motors a pioneer in electric powered cars set out to make a luxury roadster for the american market it had the global supply chain in mind
3741379 the world economy has become so integrated that shoppers find relatively few t shirts and sneakers in wal mart and target carrying a made in the u s a label but globalization may be losing some of the inexorable economic power it had for much of the past quarter century even as it faces fresh challenges as a political ideology cheap oil the lubricant of quick inexpensive transportation links across the world may not return anytime soon upsetting the logic of diffuse global supply chains that treat geography as a footnote in the pursuit of lower wages rising concern about global warming the reaction against lost jobs in rich countries worries about food safety and security and the collapse of world trade talks in geneva last week also signal that political and environmental concerns may make the calculus of globalization far more complex
3741380 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars said naomi klein the author of
3741381 many economists argue that globalization will not shift into reverse even if oil prices continue their rising trend but many see evidence that companies looking to keep prices low will have to move some production closer to consumers globe spanning supply chains brazilian iron ore turned into chinese steel used to make washing machines shipped to long beach calif and then trucked to appliance stores in chicago make less sense today than they did a few years ago to avoid having to ship all its products from abroad the swedish furniture manufacturer ikea opened its first factory in the united states in may some electronics companies that left mexico in recent years for the lower wages in china are now returning to mexico because they can lower costs by trucking their output overland to american consumers
3741382 the cost of shipping a 40 foot container from shanghai to the united states has risen to 8 000 compared with 3 000 early in the decade according to a recent study of transportation costs big container ships the pack mules of the 21st century economy have shaved their top speed by nearly 20 percent to save on fuel costs substantially slowing shipping times the study published in may by the canadian investment bank cibc world markets calculates that the recent surge in shipping costs is on average the equivalent of a 9 percent tariff on trade the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today the report concluded and as a result has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades the spike in shipping costs comes at a moment when concern about the environmental impact of globalization is also growing many companies have in recent years shifted production from countries with greater energy efficiency and more rigorous standards on carbon emissions especially in europe to those that are more lax like china and india
3741383 many leading economists say such predictions are probably overblown it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way said jeffrey d sachs director of the earth institute at columbia university distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era as economists and business executives well know shipping costs are only one factor in determining the flow of international trade when companies decide where to invest in a new factory or from whom to buy a product they also take into account exchange rates consumer confidence labor costs government regulations and the availability of skilled managers
3741384 the industries most likely to be affected by the sharp rise in transportation costs are those producing heavy or bulky goods that are particularly expensive to ship relative to their sale price steel is an example chinas steel exports to the united states are now tumbling by more than 20 percent on a year over year basis their worst performance in a decade while american steel production has been rising after years of decline motors and machinery of all types car parts industrial presses refrigerators television sets and other home appliances could also be affected plants in industries that require relatively less investment in infrastructure like furniture footwear and toys are already showing signs of mobility as shipping costs rise until recently standard practice in the furniture industry was to ship american timber from ports like norfolk baltimore and charleston to china where oak and cherry would be milled into sofas beds tables cabinets and chairs which were then shipped back to the united states but with transportation costs rising more wood is now going to traditional domestic furniture making centers in north carolina and virginia where the industry had all but been wiped out while the opening of the american ikea plant in danville va a traditional furniture producing center hit hard by the outsourcing of production to asia is perhaps most emblematic of such changes other manufacturers are also shifting some production back to the united states
3741385 soaring transportation costs also have an impact on food from bananas to salmon higher shipping rates could eventually transform some items now found in the typical middle class pantry into luxuries and further promote the so called local food movement popular in many american and european cities
3741386 global companies like general electric dupont alcoa and procter amp gamble are beginning to respond to the simultaneous increases in shipping and environmental costs with green policies meant to reduce both fuel consumption and carbon emissions that pressure is likely to increase as both manufacturers and retailers seek ways to tighten the global supply chain being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money said gary yohe an environmental economist at wesleyan university green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down in addition the sharp increase in transportation costs has implications for the just in time system pioneered in japan and later adopted the world over it is a highly profitable business strategy aimed at reducing warehousing and inventory costs by arranging for raw materials and other supplies to arrive only when needed and not before jeffrey e garten the author of world view global strategies for the new economy and a former dean of the yale school of management said that companies cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion as a result he said they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production one likely outcome if transportation rates stay high economists said would be a strengthening of the neighborhood effect instead of seeking supplies wherever they can be bought most cheaply regardless of location and outsourcing the assembly of products all over the world manufacturers would instead concentrate on performing those activities as close to home as possible
3741387 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3741388 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3741389 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3741390 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3741391 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3741392 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3741393 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3741394 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3741395 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3741396 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3741397 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3741398 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3741399 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3741400 with dramatic corporate events continuing to make headlines around the world from numerous product recalls to rogue bank trading activity to the continued fallout from the sub prime mortgage crisis one thing is clear executive management teams and their boards are fundamentally rethinking their focus on risk management
3741401 for example if a consumer packaged goods company wants to introduce a new product into the market a combined risk and strategy management solution will help executives determine if there are any risks to supporting an expanded product line
3741402 this now paves the way for the transfer of credits from the clean development mechanism into the eu registry system linking up with the uns carbon credit registry will further strengthen europes leading role in the global carbon market
3741403 i stopped by here with 15 of my fellow hikers after a lovely day on schunemunk mountain we were hungry dirty and tired the waitress graciously
3741404 its unfortunate that honor killing has come out as a catch phrase for this crime
3741405 it does a disservice to this man his family and culture it is being used loosely without the full aspect of whats going on in this case
3741406 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3741407 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3741408 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3741409 the russians are encroaching upon the capital they are making a circle
3741410 we will protect our capital until the last drop of our blood

3741418 we have enough reserves in the budget of the russian federation this allows us to assign the needed money without altering the budget
3741419 we need to approach new fiscal liabilities in a very balanced and well thought out way additional money should only be sent where it is really necessary
3741420 the kind of security guarantees are needed that would not leave poland with only the bare missile defense installation
3741421 today its much more probable than a few weeks ago that the american side will take into consideration the proposition of my government
3741422 nous craignons que la boisson ne joue un r le dans un certain nombre de ces situations

3741442 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
3741443 i have proposed an increase of osce monitors by 100
3741444 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3741445 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3741446 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3741447 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3741448 you can decide to make strong statements with one sided condemnations or you can look to the future and take a real role in stabilizing the situation
3741449 each of them stood firm and often they stood alone they refused to give in instead showing an endurance that the world has come to admire
3741450 the care of the residents is paramount in our minds and we would look after them at all costs
3741451 the consequences of this decision are that the approved provider is obliged by law to continue to provide care but will not be eligible to receive commonwealth subsidies from that date
3741452 progress is being made but there is very substantial non compliance issues

3741471 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3741472 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies

3741477 ive been involved with many community groups in ballarat for quite some time and ive been increasing that involvement in recent years
3741478 my enthusiasm and love for ballarat and the opportunity to represent the community as a councillor are also reasons for standing and the election coming up this year is really good timing for me
3741479 although i was unsuccessful i learned a great deal from that and i want to put that into practice
3741480 i feel i can be one of the three councillors in the ward from the knowledge i have from attending meetings and i was also one of the people that made application to the victorian electoral commission about the new ward changes so i have a good idea of how it should work
3741481 what his parents didnt know was that he was still using drugs things started to unravel

3741553 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
3741554 considering he missed most of last season we would hope that he would be injury free now
3741555 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the scottish cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
3741556 we will have some decisions to make for saturday davie is available again and i believe kenny and kevin will both be fine
3741557 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well kirk broadfoot has been playing centre half since pre season started more or less and he has been doing well too
3741558 i think it is his best position he played most of his games at full back last season because of the consistency shown by carlos cuellar and davie
3741559 he has had the chance to show what he can do this season and he has done well
3741560 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3741561 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is

3741569 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3741570 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3741571 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3741572 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3741573 in questo anno garlasco ha continuato a lavorare e a svilupparsi assicura il sindaco spialtini e i cittadini hanno reagito con determinazione a una tragedia che peraltro nessuno vuole dimenticare e per la quale chiedono giustizia da parte nostra non c sfiducia nel lavoro degli inquirenti ma unattesa impaziente
3741574 temo che nessuno verr mai a capo di questo mistero sostiene una volontaria della croce garlaschese il centro di soccorso frequentato anche da stefania cappa una delle gemelle cugine di chiara divenute personaggi di questa vicenda non un caso che ormai si parli del delitto solo quando esce un articolo sul giornale
3741575 la mia comunit stata duramente segnata da questa tragedia osserva ma ha saputo crescere con questa sofferenza ed riuscita con la preghiera a mostrare solidariet e rispetto sia per la famiglia di chiara sia per la famiglia di alberto
3741576 golf prides presence at the first three majors in 2008 was strong we were pleased to see the trend continue at the pga championship this week with 81 percent of the field and 90 percent of the top 30 finishers trusting our grips to play their best
3741577 this is a great accomplishment for fujikura because the amateur golfer is in the unique position to make her own independent and educated decision about the shafts she plays
3741578 this u s amateur win continues to validate that these accomplished players trust the performance of our shafts in the most demanding competitions
3741579 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3741580 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3741581 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3741582 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3741583 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3741584 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3741585 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3741586 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3741587 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3741588 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3741589 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3741590 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3741591 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3741592 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3741593 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3741594 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3741595 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3741596 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3741597 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3741598 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it

3741600 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3741601 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3741602 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3741603 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3741604 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3741605 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3741606 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3741607 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3741608 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3741609 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3741610 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3741611 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3741612 these are all small things and they all add up

3741614 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3741615 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3741616 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3741617 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3741618 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3741619 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3741620 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3741621 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3741622 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3741623 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3741624 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3741625 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3741626 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3741627 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3741628 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3741629 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3741630 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3741631 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3741632 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3741633 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3741634 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
3741635 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
3741636 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3741637 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3741638 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3741639 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3741640 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3741641 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3741642 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3741643 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3741644 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3741645 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3741646 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3741647 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3741648 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3741649 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3741650 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3741651 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3741652 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3741653 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3741654 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3741655 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3741656 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3741657 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3741658 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3741659 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3741660 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3741661 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3741662 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3741663 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3741664 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3741665 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3741666 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3741667 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3741668 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3741669 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3741670 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3741671 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3741672 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3741673 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3741674 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3741675 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3741676 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3741677 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3741678 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3741679 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3741680 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3741681 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3741682 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3741683 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3741684 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3741685 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3741686 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3741687 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3741688 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3741689 just so you all know we did set a record
3741690 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3741691 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3741692 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

3741701 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3741702 es otro disparate que lo nico que hace es desacreditarnos externamente y generar aumento de desconfianza interno
3741703 la base de la mentira sobre la que el gobierno intenta construir una salida econ mica inviable
3741704 los problemas son tan graves que estamos en final de fiesta y en la argentina el final de fiesta se paga muy caro
3741705 hay que volver a empezar de cero en el indec
3741706 est claro que tenemos un problema que hay que resolver porque si no lo atendemos en este momento puede multiplicarse el conflicto con el campo desnud elementos de fragilidad creo que hace falta ajustar una serie de variables
3741707 el de la inflaci n es un problema basado en la incertidumbre sobre cu nto es dado que las estad sticas dejaron de ser confiables
3741708 por una serie de razones entre ellas el indec no sabemos cu nto es la inflaci n ese problema fundamental necesita arreglarse no s lo con un plan antiinflacionario sino con un proceso que devuelva credibilidad al indec
3741709 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3741710 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3741711 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3741712 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3741713 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3741714 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3741715 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3741716 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3741717 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3741718 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3741719 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3741720 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3741721 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3741722 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3741723 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3741724 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3741725 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3741726 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3741727 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3741728 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3741729 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3741730 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3741731 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3741732 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3741733 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3741734 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3741735 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3741736 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3741737 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3741738 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3741739 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3741740 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3741741 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3741742 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3741743 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3741744 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3741745 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3741746 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3741747 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3741748 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3741749 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living

3741755 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3741756 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3741757 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3741758 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3741759 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3741760 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

3741764 so i had a gross and embarrassing fly problem in my house
3741765 whoa this normally doesnt happen at a hardware store esp at home depot
3741766 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3741767 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3741768 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3741769 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3741770 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3741771 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3741772 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3741773 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3741774 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3741775 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3741776 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years

3741781 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3741784 police driven by targets send dockets to court prosecutors also driven by targets bargain with the perpetrators when they see that the case will take them longer
3741785 the outcome of these changes will be a reduction of case cycle and the number of hearings per case
3741786 the outcome of these will be seen over a period of time
3741787 drivers will slow down to look at anything something as simple as a couch dumped in a roadside ditch can send minor shudders of curiosity through the traffic flow traffic is jammed with these
3741788 if the challenge is to be graded on objectivity thoroughness discipline and sincerity it passes with flying colors
3741789 what carr excels at where his gifts as a journalist shine is explaining how an addicts life works the economics of it the ad hoc social web the quotidian feel of the thing its an essay in urban typology worthy of balzac at his keenest and least windy
3741790 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned
3741791 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3741792 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3741793 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3741794 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3741795 a number of stadiums are reflecting there are going to be some cost overruns
3741796 national fiscus will have to make a contribution host cities will have to make a contribution and we have to involve institutions such as the dbsa

3741798 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year

3741805 i thought the woman was desperate that the man be killed because she asked me repeatedly to do it
3741806 i did not know where the bullet hit the deceased and if he was dead or alive
3741807 i was frustrated because i did not go there with the intention that anyone should be killed
3741808 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3741809 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3741810 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3741811 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3741812 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3741813 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3741814 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3741815 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3741816 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3741817 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3741818 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3741819 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3741820 we were thinking that an nba team was going to make an offer

3741825 his day is very busy exercising writing reflecting thinking sometimes it is he who gives me international news that i have not had time to read
3741826 fidel is doing almost the same that hes always done
3741827 raul is not going to stop listening to his advice
3741828 the navigator but i do believe he has a kind of veto influence over big issues
3741829 by the same token fidel realises that he is no longer president and has to allow his successors to chart their own course within certain broad parameters
3741830 has managed to both organise a political succession to his brother raul and to chaperon the new government
3741831 the mec provincial minister pw saaiman will if need be act as the appeal authority in this matter and cannot there for comment at this stage
3741832 the da would like to question the motives for these suspensions
3741833 the question is was their suspension politically motivated and if so why
3741834 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3741835 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3741836 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3741837 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3741838 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3741839 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3741840 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3741841 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3741842 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3741843 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3741844 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3741845 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3741846 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3741847 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3741848 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3741849 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3741850 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3741851 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3741852 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3741853 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3741854 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3741855 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3741856 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3741857 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3741858 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3741859 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3741860 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3741861 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3741862 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3741863 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3741864 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3741865 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3741866 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3741867 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3741868 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3741869 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3741870 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3741871 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3741872 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3741873 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3741874 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3741875 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3741876 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3741877 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3741878 i was offered coronation street a few times but always said no i thought it was beneath me to be honest
3741879 but its really nice to be writing for something that you know is going to be on screen
3741880 the fans think hes a negative stereotype because hes camp but hes got a dick hes unapologetic the hard thing has been coming from theatre where you handpick people and feel connected to a show to somewhere where there are lots of actors some good some not so booo he wont name names you quickly learn who says your lines correctly and who doesnt
3741881 its like the family silver to go from the bush theatre with 80 people watching to 12 million is something
3741882 so most of the actors are really small sally webster is like a doll cars rarely park on the street because if they do they dwarf at least three houses
3741883 swallows up stories so quickly i loved raquel having a dinner party and saying you cant go wrong with boil in the bag that to me is more memorable than maya setting fire to devs shop

3741897 having had an std roughly quadruples a womans odds of reporting sexual pain and triples her lubrication problems

3741901 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3741902 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3741903 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3741904 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3741905 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3741906 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3741907 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3741908 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3741909 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3741910 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

3741917 wouldnt necessarily extend longevity but it would compress the period at the end of life when people couldnt carry out daily tasks on their own
3741918 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3741919 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3741920 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3741921 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3741922 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3741923 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3741924 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3741925 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3741926 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3741927 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3741928 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3741929 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3741930 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3741931 when you come in at 500 600 miles per hour i e in a manned aircraft drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens

3741936 ive hiked for years on thousands of miles of trails and this was the first time ive ever been truly afraid
3741937 once you make the decision to squeeze the trigger and discharge a round you cant ever take that back
3741938 all i can say is that it never should have happened
3741939 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3741940 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3741941 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3741942 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3741943 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3741944 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3741945 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3741946 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3741947 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3741948 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3741949 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

3742163 following a report from the health and safety advisor it has become necessary to cease the clock winding activity in its current form due to the danger posed by the extremely difficult conditions within the clock tower
3742164 the space is extremely confined there are no handrails and inadequate footholds the confined space makes it impossible to install sufficient safety restraints
3742165 our focus now is on finding alternative means for keeping the clock going either through mechanisation or moving of the clock mechanism
3742166 the currently employed clock winder mr rees will be kept fully informed of our progress in this regard and may still need to be involved in the future management of the clock
3742167 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters
3742168 this is far away from what i have done erlier i feel really excited and have once again found the passion of making music
3742169 i would like to thank all the fans of carnal forge for the endless support through the years i was in the band and hopefully some of you will like what i do now
3742170 i remember asking her mom whats wrong with your knees
3742171 we didnt want you to speak indian because we didnt want you to be punished we didnt want you to have to crawl across the floors and scrub floors
3742172 the last thing she did was she started singing indian
3742173 in the end they tied sacks of marbles on her knees and forced her to scrub floors with a toothbrush on her knees that is why her knees swelled up when it rained
3742174 it justified all the bad things that were happening to indian people i knew we had to continue
3742175 i got up and spoke about the terrible conditions for american indian people
3742176 there was absolutely nothing to make our children feel good
3742177 today they are digging us up all over the western hemisphere they have never found a prison or a guillotine it must have been a great civilization they found out that indian people had no trace of alcohol
3742178 we chose to make that change by standing on our treaty rights
3742179 now indian people are making compacts with the states giving up treaty rights for casinos
3742180 we dont have to worry about the government anymore we are terminating ourselves
3742181 they didnt give us nothing everything that white america got they got from us
3742182 as long as the rivers flow the grass grows and the sun shines
3742183 all the gold in fort knox comes from indian land
3742184 we got them off welfare rolls and put them on payrolls
3742185 we had to create our own institutions even today we can do that all across america
3742186 it is not a walk or run across america when the prayers are over it is time to roll up the sleeves and get to work
3742187 the creator is not going to help you unless you help yourself
3742188 there was a time when everything was done through prayer through a ceremony through a song
3742189 creator to watch over us and mother earth to provide for us
3742190 the american indian movement said we will never give up another inch of our land and we will fight for everything we have lost
3742191 you just have to be who you are fight and struggle defend the treaty rights
3742192 we are still at war we are going to unite and we are going to work together to fight injustice
3742193 all i cold think about was when i get out of jail im going to go to a sundance
3742194 if you try to do something they will put you in jail you had better go talk to the warriors the sundancers
3742195 why did you do that why would you push your brother out the window
3742196 it was an accident mom i didnt mean it i didnt mean to push him out the window i swear is he ok
3742197 he looks fine there dont appear to be any broken bones and theres no blood
3742198 but i dont know whether he hit his head or anything so i have to take him to the emergency room dont you ever do something like this again i dont care if you are joking around you were just asking for trouble by doing what you did
3742199 im sorry mom im sorry davey i didnt mean it
3742200 ydare me to hit you over the head with this crowbar
3742201 we both have regular day jobs we actually have several each so sometimes its hard to find the time and weve decided to focus on quality rather than quantity theres a few street style blogs out there that are really crappy and take pics of anyone and very randomly after we got back from new york we spent three months there this spring we decided to make the site one of our priorities though
3742202 first and foremost we look at the clothes they usually have a somewhat coherent style but we do make exceptions as long as it fits the person and that the style has a purpose sometimes we see people in really cool clothes who look really uncomfortable or people who look really full of themselves and we always decide against taking their pics because we believe it shines through in a picture its really hard maybe impossible to create a niche within street style photos theres just so many talented people like hel looks stil in berlin the sartorialist and face hunter but to us street style is about representing the city and its culture

3742206 would let the federal housing administration back 300 billion in new cheaper home loans for an estimated 400 000 distresse who otherwise would be considered too financially risky to qualify for government insured fixed rate loans
3742207 we need to demonstrate to people in this country that have lost an awful lot of faith in almost everything but certainly in congress that we can get something done that we can put aside differences and make a difference in their lives
3742208 your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didnt stop to think if they should
3742209 the moon race was more than exploration for its own sake and a lot more than an exercise in national pride it was considered a real life test of the viability of our open society a vindication of the very concept of freedom
3742210 the first generation of nasa employees and scientists were raised during the great depression and the second world war and accepted the middle class values of honesty and hard work as natural parts of life
3742211 inherited an organization with much weaker central control and far more bureaucracy
3742212 patterns in long term trends over the last 200 years point specifically toward the human colonization of space in the next 20
3742213 its about gas prices its about food prices its about the economy
3742214 people here dont like democratic sen barack obama but they dont like the economic situation either more and more i hear people say they just arent going to vote
3742215 im not saying it is right but a lot of people have bought into the mccain is just a third term for bush argument
3742216 the administration is getting the blame for the economy and the gas prices
3742217 im definitely an obama supporter but even if he wins he wont win kentucky or hopkinsville
3742218 mccain is the right man everyone talks about the economy and whoever is in office takes the blame but it will take care of itself
3742219 what isnt going to take care of itself is national defense and the terrorism issue
3742220 hes not the most conservative candidate but hes the most conservative candidate of the two left

3742228 hes got great first up form unbeaten from three goes and had a good trial
3742229 tivo has come to represent the product and the activity so a lot of times what i hear is people saying i plan to tivo that show and they dont own tivo
3742230 the more people that are in the market competing well that forces them to get better and better to attract business
3742231 i expect more good things to come out of this market in terms of ease of use recording capability thats more good news for consumers
3742232 i think if i was senator obama i would say the biggest economic problem we face is the biggest national security problem and the biggest environmental problem and if i were him i would ask al gore to serve as his vice president his energy czar in his administration to reduce our consumption and reliance on foreign energy sources

3742243 in the absence of a place where a genuine reinvention happens an honest substitute will be a city that shelters a fiction of the reinvention that never occurred a city that assumes the external appearance of the expectations of that one who sought it leading him to believe in a battle won a city that is benign to those who change in nothing except in the belief that something important has changed and who euphorically begin to build a life on that certainty

3742259 aber dass broukal mit der politik seiner partei nicht zufrieden war l sst sich ja auch daran ablesen dass er nicht mehr f r die sp f r den nationalrat kandidiert

3742272 are they likeable trustworthy influential do consumers find them to be aspirational do people sit up and pay attention when they come on tv awareness is a good first step but there are other attributes that are more powerful when it comes to motivating consumers
3742273 he was an obvious choice even before the games and hes lived up to the expectations thus far even before the games began he was among the best known u s olympians from an endorsement perspective whats not to like for starters hes a winner in fact hell likely earn an unprecedented tenth gold medal today the phrase golden boy certainly applies here phelps is exactly what marketers are looking for in an olympic athlete focused but still fun authentic hard working handsome his reaction sans cap and goggles as teammate jason lesak made his way down the homestretch in sundays relay was priceless its an image well see for years to come
3742274 natalies spent a lot of time on the medal stand which has kept her in the spotlight off of it her personality has really shone through i think shes connected with many americans she handles herself wonderfully in press interviews and her good looks dont hurt either from an endorsement perspective
3742275 in terms of marketing potential id say theyre on equal footing right now they have good energy and terrific smiles good personalities nastia is the veteran shawn is newly dominant in the sport they complement each other with the u s team and china the clear favorites theres a good storyline in place although they both have several sponsorship deals in place already success tonight could push up their stock
3742276 daras been a major story because of her age the supermom image makes her unique it sets her apart from all of the other great athletes at the games and gives her a strong hook or identity its whats fueled the buzz around her which is one reason shes known by about a quarter of u s consumers those who know her tend to find her likeable and trustworthy endorsers are drawn to that a gold in the 50 meters would enhance her marketability but shes in good shape as it is
3742277 as demonstrated by celebrity athletes like muhammad ali tiger woods and michael phelps dominance when done right is extremely marketable misty and kerri do it right their ability to work as a team is appealing to brands their sport is more fun than many of the more traditional olympic sports which appeals to a younger audience theyve also gotten a lot of tv time so theyre familiar to a lot of u s consumers of course thats no accident nbc has clearly recognized their appeal
3742278 his remarkable come from behind performance on monday morning may not win him a slew of endorsement deals but i wouldnt be surprised if he picks up some because of it at 32 his success ensures him of a post games career in some capacity whether its as a broadcaster or motivational speaker
3742279 collectively i think they may have some marketability especially if the u s women do well tonight it wouldve helped their cause collectively and individually if they couldve held on to the second position last night and won the silver regardless they did something in the team competition that no one would have believed possible as they overcame injuries to two key teammates including former gold medalist paul hamm thats the kind of inspirational against all odds unscripted olympic story that appeals to americans and our values its also what makes the games and sports in general appealing to brands the 1980 hockey team mary lou retton kerri strug these are the stories that really captivate an audience and provide a platform for creating instant and sustained marketability

3742300 it is not an indictment of your educational quality because it is such a different sample of students from what weve seen before
3742301 instead of testing just the college bound you are testing a lot of students who didnt plan to attend college
3742302 a lot of variation in high school in terms of how well kids are being prepared for college
3742303 as we expand the pool for more students we are bringing in more students for whom high school is not preparing them as well for post secondary education

3742305 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3742306 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3742307 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3742308 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws

3742314 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3742315 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3742316 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3742317 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3742318 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it

3742329 they were having some keypads issues what the judges push the other was a broadcasters decision it was not nbc the beijing broadcasters were showing the floor live as alicia was ready to compete on beam they couldnt change in the middle of a live event
3742330 the reasons seem logical even though we dont like them
3742331 it was not our decision to hold the competitor from competing
3742332 those are decisions that are made by the fig international gymnastics federation competition official the federations run the competition
3742333 they never should talk to the gymnast and they are obliged to do it right
3742334 we did so much training of making them tough and keeping their focus and concentration and still it happens it is disappointing
3742335 at this point the fig and the international olympic committee have closed the age issue
3742336 its fair to address but at this point the competition was what it was today china was a better team on the competition floor i think theres no making excuses
3742337 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible

3742343 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3742344 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else

3742346 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3742347 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3742348 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3742349 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane

3742356 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
3742357 we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video
3742358 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3742359 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3742360 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3742361 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3742362 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3742363 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3742364 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3742365 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed

3742392 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3742393 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3742394 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens
3742395 certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier

3742423 it is scandalous that we know so little about a species we are putting under such huge pressure from illegal fishing and oversized fleets
3742424 wwfs new tagging project will shed new light on tuna migratoryroutes and behaviour which will enable far more effective recovery and management plans both for the tuna and the fishery that depends on them
3742425 the plan behind this project is to fill the gap between the little we do know about bluefin behaviour in the mediterraneanand what we need to know
3742426 when we have better data we would urge fisheries decision makers to use it to make better informed choices for the management of this endangered species
3742427 last year we produced some 140 000 tonnes of salmon worth almost 400
3742428 our farmed rainbow and brown trout industry is also worth over 10
3742429 it is clear that we need to maintain a scottish aquaculture industry

3742436 this strategy is an important initiative which we expect to encourage the more effective utilisation of scotlands inshore marine resources particularly in the sector of shellfish cultivation that will benefit the economic and social future of rural and coastal communities where shellfish farming provides a perfect fit with crofting and other economic activities that will help to keep people in these areas
3742437 shellfish cultivation which in scotland means mussels oysters and scallops has long been regarded as the cinderella of the scottish aquaculture sector this pejorative view is not reflected in many other countries both within the european community and elsewhere where shellfish farming is given significant government support in light of the natural fecundity of scottish waters which have an estimated potential annual output of 100 000 tonnes of cultivated molluscs combined with the relative absence of pollution in the optimal growing areas we hope that this poor relation perception will be corrected by the creation of a relevant appropriate and focussed strategic framework

3742442 i never plan to tough it either i can still remember being in the rooms and being at all the functions afterwards and it would have been easy when it was being passed around to grab it and have a drink out of it but for some reason i was really aware of not wanting to touch it
3742443 at the end of the day it wasnt the best result to have lost over in perth but for me it was just about getting through the game at that pace and getting through it without injuries
3742444 i didnt think i had that much of the football until i got back to melbourne and my girlfriend told me i didnt think i would have had that much of an impact
3742445 i think i can go out there and have the same amount of influence this weekend
3742446 i feel a lot more comfortable out there so i think i can post another solid performance
3742447 injuries were on my mind a bit at the start of the season but i have stopped worrying about it as the season has progressed
3742448 it does play on your mind a little bit but i am doing everything right as far as training and massages and those sorts of things go so my body is feeling pretty good
3742449 if i keep that up hopefully i wont have to worry about injuries again in the near future
3742450 i am really looking forward to next year when i can put my best foot forward and give the season a real shot
3742451 i try to model my game on mcleod and wanganeen and try to do what they kind of do which is pretty hard because they are very talented players

3742474 im very much aware of the important role played by the berthing gangs the tug drivers and the security officers
3742475 the hiving off of these services to private operators will impact negatively on employees conditions of service and on safety

3742494 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
3742495 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
3742496 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3742497 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3742498 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3742499 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components

3742547 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3742548 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3742553 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3742554 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3742555 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3742556 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3742557 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3742581 uhhhh i dont think taking a picture where we try to make our eyes look chinese is a good idea especially seeing how people already think were the most racist sporting nation on earth
3742582 hbos incredible enthusiasm is what sold us its an opportunity to get it out to the biggest audience namely in the urban areas
3742583 sepertinya saya kurang setuju sepertinya saya kurang sependapat saya kurang bisa
3742584 islam is not degrading the woman that is something that was brought into islam by the corrupt scholars in islamic history
3742585 first of all i must point out that a relationship between a muslim woman and a non muslim man remains unlawful in the islamic shariah
3742586 ahmad you do realize that even the danish state have to provide security for the citizens right
3742587 if you give up rights for security youll end up losing both
3742588 no muslim in the right mind would dare delete any hadith or tamper with the prophets heritage
3742589 what we are actually doing is re classifying re categorizing the hadith and translating it into turkish no more no less
3742590 we have compiled all hadiths and read them to reclassify them anew
3742591 we have also taken into account the unauthentic ones or those attributed falsely to the prophet because to understand the true hadith you really need to understand the unauthentic sayings

3742597 accusing the pious sahaba ra of failing to implement a fair system because their method of ruling was far from western democracy
3742598 got news for you there is no such thing as ultimate truth
3742599 well i am a member of the danish peoples church
3742600 do christians also belief that jesus peace be upon him was born without a father
3742601 not without a father his father is god according to traditional christian theology but if you ask me i do not believe that mary was a virgin i believe that jesus was born just like everybody else
3742602 jesus peace be upon him acutally had a father and his name was yosef

3742604 but still i view the perker word as an insult if i am being referred to as such by a complete stranger
3742605 my point was not who is more reliable and who is more democratic i know that but my point was you should also be open to the fact that the possibility that some of these things could be a lie do exist you rightfully expect me to do the same
3742606 the fact that you limit yourself to the past 40 years shows bias
3742607 and look what it brought us losses of egyptian soldiers en masse and yet the future for palestinians looks darker than ever
3742608 specially as the arabs have a much larger area which they do hold without question jordan syria saudi arabia iraq
3742609 for example exiled jews in the 19th century would wish for their return to jerusalem and many would consider jerusalem
3742610 the jews wished for jerusalem for centuries the arabs didnt
3742611 your religion is false but we will appropriate your prophets
3742612 may the experiences that my family had experienced be fall on you on day
3742613 what would the cunning and hungry fox say when he cannot reach a bundle of succulent and juicy grapes too high for him to reach in the grapevine
3742614 thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the lord of the heavens and the earth as eye opening evidence and i consider thee indeed o pharaoh to be one doomed to destruction
3742615 im not saying that israel must be jewish because g d said so
3742616 you are making a rather decisive error of logic here ahmad you are mixing two distinct concepts one being faith the other being extended family and the nation that grew out of it
3742617 your mistake is first and foremost in treating the jews as purely a belief system
3742618 so we have an assertion in the quran that the land was given to the children of israel to inhabit but the inheritance of the right to live in the land is not a matter of belief unless the almighty explicitly states that he has disowned the children of israel and given the right to live in the land to others based on their pure faith
3742619 so the question is thus simple does the quran explicitly assert that the children of israel have been stripped of their birthright as defined by the almighty and that birthright had been given over to others of
3742620 then we said to the children of israel dwell in the land
3742621 as for the naming of the land that actually is the simplest matter here if the land was given over to the children of israel then it thus becomes the land of the people of israel named after those who have been given it by divine edict
3742622 then we said to the children of israel dwell in the land
3742623 the reason is correct and yet nowhere is it stated that
3742624 ten of the tribes have been lost to babylonian forced relocation though we have managed to recover the remnants of some some remnants that bear the naming customs partial traditions and oral history of the children of israel still remain the largest noteworthy group to claim to originate from the ten lost tribes are the pashtun people of afghanistan if you have other national cultural groups that claim to trace their lineage to the hebrews please let me know the existence of other people who hold a somewhat legitimate claim to having descended of or once having had in their midst one of the tribes of israel does not in any way lower from the legitimate claim of the jews it merely adds others who share the birthright in question
3742625 shrug conquest of land without having been granted the divine edict that it is your land doesnt make it your land for all eternity you could have just as easily argued that the hebrews have lost the right to rule the land based on the conquests of the babylonians persians greeks romans and various armies since
3742626 the importance of the conqueror in question in the matters of just rule by divine law and the edicts that he has published does not imply a divine edict to rule the land anymore than it implies that those who were not of
3742627 unless of course you can show me in the quran hadith or even in the rulings of the early clerics and leaders of islam that the land was given by the almightys will and must remain in the hands of the
3742628 i would say instead that the conquests are but a temporary measure even if they are made by those
3742629 very well this is probably the only point i can entirely concede on that the name of a region is but the commonly accepted form by the majority if most people know it by such a name then that is the name of the region for them but to cling to one name and to object to another based on political considerations thus becomes a rather problematic issue do you now call it palestine because it is how you have commonly known the region to be named or do you cling to the old accepted name because accepting the current name would imply losing face or conceding a common political cause as for us we simply knew it as the land of israel or the land of the city of jerusalem or the holy land or simply the land jews knew quite well what they were referring to when they spoke of the land
3742630 from this does not follow that abraham was a muslim
3742631 should we still assume that the central issue is bani israel not their faith then still this covers other than the jews so either way we see it it cannot be specifically granted to the jews
3742632 there seems to be some kind of agreement that it means a muslim who predates muhammads saw prophecy
3742633 so i fail to see how his ruling would be abnormal
3742634 from this does not follow that abraham was a muslim
3742635 fact in the quran that piece of land is not called palestine its called israel
3742636 fact before the kabba was cleansed of idols muslims prayed towards jerusalem
3742637 fact based on the facts above there is evidence that clearly indicates the inherent ties between the land of israel and the jewish people however there is no evidence indicating that the land is exclusively jewish or exclusively meant for jews
3742638 would it not also include people who came to the realisation that there is only one god who created the world without reading or hearing of any scripture would a zoroastrian not qualify as a haneef what about yezidis i think they all qualify
3742639 i disagree the quran also used the same term children of israel to discuss the hebrews long after jacob and moses were dead during the times of king david king solomon and during even later periods in which the babylonian exile and roman exile took place unless you mean that the exact same terminology has a different meanings in different verses when in each case it was referring to them as children of israel long after israel meaning the patriarch jacob was long dead already encompassing an extended family nation and encompasses a much larger group of people
3742640 yes the reference in that particular verse refers to the children of israel who were with moses because they were the entirety of the children of israel for their time and yet referring to them in a continuous manner for later periods in hebrew history speaking of the same continuous group does show a continuity in everything discussed that continuity is very important and shows that it wasnt individuals in a certain era who were discussed but rather a continuous nation
3742641 his ruling is actually not an assertion of jewish right as much as it is an assertion that there is no islamic counter no authoritative ruling that the land must be under muslim sovereignty he simply says that there is no islamic argument to object to jewish sovereignty in the land and that there exist numerous implications to the possibility that the jews are living in the land with divine approval
3742642 the quran recognizes the land of israel as the heritage of the jews and it explains that before the last judgment jews will return to dwell there this prophecy has already been fulfilled
3742643 does muslim rule for a specific time contradict a general right
3742644 i could rightly argue that jewish rule in the land at that period of time was impossible the jews were too spread apart across the world with the various sovereigns and armies around not being all that friendly towards them
3742645 it all right that the prophet ordered to stick to the rightly guided caliph but does the prophet indicated omar as being one and does a rightly guided caliph mean infallible one like a catholic pope
3742646 based on the facts above there is evidence that clearly proves that the children of israel at some point were given the right to inhabit the land
3742647 enter the holy land which god has assigned unto you and turn not back ignominiously
3742648 fact is that the jews in holy land were treated the exact same way as any other religious minority under
3742649 i cannot get how umar ra and the caliphs after him possibly could have ruled palestine if it were legally the right of bani israel to rule
3742650 the land given to the children of israel by g d
3742651 but thats a slippery slope towards complete irrelevance of the quran once the word of g d as recorded by the quran if we assume the quran is the word of g d is not understood as permanent everything in the quran becomes unimportant the quran commands muslims to pray five times a day perhaps they dont have to care any more the quran says that the jews will be punished exiled twice perhaps they will be exiled a third time the quran says that muhammed was the greatest prophet perhaps there will be a greater one
3742652 o my people call in remembrance the favour of allah unto you when he produced prophets among you made you kings and gave you what he had not given to any other among the peoples
3742653 o my people enter the holy land which allah hath assigned unto you and turn not back ignominiously for then will ye be overthrown to your own ruin
3742654 and why wouldnt they have been the land was under muslim muhammedan rule the quran doesnt demand that the land be under jewish rule it merely allows for it to be while not specifically acknowledging that non jews have any rights at all to the land
3742655 both tanakh and quran acknowledge that g d gave the land of israel to the jews
3742656 the problem is that it is not at all obvious that umar would not have given up sovereignty or granted autonomy to a jewish state if enough jews had followed his call to return to israel
3742657 the bani israel have a right to dwell in israel not necessarily a right to rule however they do rule now and there is nothing in the quran that indicates that such rule is illegal
3742658 as drima said the quran refers to the land as israel namely when it refers to the land as the land given to the children of israel by g d
3742659 and then when the banu israel went out from egypt allah ordered them to fight ahl arihaa from the soils of palestine
3742660 the quran recognizes the land of israel as the heritage of the jews and it explains that before the last judgment jews will return to dwell there this prophecy has already been fulfilled
3742661 take not other than me as disposer of your affairs
3742662 o moses i consider thee indeed to have been worked upon by sorcery
3742663 fact in the quran that piece of land is not called palestine its called israel
3742664 o my people call in remembrance the favour of allah unto you when he produced prophets among you made you kings and gave you what he had not given to any other among the peoples
3742665 o my people enter the holy land which allah hath assigned unto you and turn not back ignominiously for then will ye be overthrown to your own ruin
3742666 the jewish idea that jews have a continuous relation to the land and twice when they have gone completely overboard with their shit they were indeed overthrown but the whole thing nevertheless continues as it is which is witnessed by their subsequent returns to the land
3742667 frankly the more you explain it the more it starts looking exactly as what roman is saying and how its understood in the jewish tradition basically the jewish tradition would readily agree with the idea that the both times the jews have been kicked out of israel it happened because of them going astray
3742668 i am not sure i understand your last sentence jews and christians dont believe in god only muslims do
3742669 anyway what follows from your quotes is first of all that the land is indeed given to bani israil nowhere its said that bani israil are muslims
3742670 oh my sons allah hath chosen the faith for you then die not except in the faith of islam
3742671 in the passages you quote jews are only instructed to behave nicely and be good boys or else
3742672 you should also take into account that jews have a different concept of what sinful means from what you say it looks as if islam holds practicing judaism as something which is bad enough to justify stripping a person from all promises god or man has given to him
3742673 and you interpret that to mean that a the children of israel are not actually the people that descended from jacob
3742674 your assumption that those fighting israel today are acting on behalf contradicts the quran probability and reality
3742675 first the quran would have predicted such an event instead of predicting the return of the children of israel
3742676 second the idea that g d supports secular arab nationalism in its fight against all sorts of minorities including the returning children of israel is just a bit too convenient to be true
3742677 and third israel is winning events happened that at least seem miraculous and they happened in israels favour also israel is doing much better economically than those arab countries that fight it whereas those arab countries that dont fight are also doing better than those who fight israel if g d wanted to help israel he couldnt do a better job assuming that israels own shortcomings prevent even greater successes and if g d wanted to help the anti zionist forces he couldnt do a worse job because they keep losing even with modern weaponry advantage of numbers advantage of ruthlessness and advantage of first move most of the time
3742678 you have the quran telling you that a g d gave the land to the children of israel b the children of israel would lose his favour twice and be punished twice c the children of israel would return
3742679 b the jews have lost his favour again or havent gotten it back despite the fact that the quran doesnt mention such
3742680 become jews or christians if ye would be guided to salvation
3742681 nay i would rather the religion of abraham the true and he joined not gods with allah
3742682 curses were pronounced on those among the children of israel who rejected faith by the tongue of david and of jesus the son of mary because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses
3742683 holocaust happened so many jews were killed if god wanted to help the jews why didnt he start there
3742684 i bet if we had a better knowledge of your religion the debate could have looked very different
3742685 now when it comes to omar he has nothing to do with this there was no equivalent of zionism in those days the jews were not aiming at statehood at the time no such demands were presented to omar and his successors probably if they were i guess omar would have rejected them and advised against by the majority of scholars nevertheless as a matter of fact he was never called on to make such a decision so no legal precedence exists here in the first place the koran has no instructions for muslims as to what they are supposed to do about it they were not asked to set up a state for the jews there is only a general piece of informatioon here about something concluded between the jews and god and the prediction that these will be back one day and thats all
3742686 1 the quran states that the religion intended for them children of israel was islam
3742687 2 his followers were thus granted a land as a result of their faith which was islam
3742688 3 the jews went astray from the religion of abraham islam
3742689 1 you have yet to prove that the quran predicts that the land will be ruled by bani israil again and even if you can you have to prove that this do not refer to the return of the messiah before that this remains an unsupported claim of yours
3742690 2 i assume that your silence regarding the matter of naming of the land means acceptance
3742691 your whole comment is an attempt to refute my saying that bani israil means muslims which is rather weird considering that i never said that
3742692 you have yet to prove that the quran predicts that the land will be ruled by bani israil again
3742693 now when it comes to omar he has nothing to do with this there was no equivalent of zionism in those days the jews were not aiming at statehood at the time no such demands were presented to omar and his successors probably if they were i guess omar would have rejected them and advised against by the majority of scholars nevertheless as a matter of fact he was never called on to make such a decision so no legal precedence exists here in the first place the koran has no instructions for muslims as to what they are supposed to do about it they were not asked to set up a state for the jews there is only a general piece of information here about something concluded between the jews and god and the prediction that these will be back one day and thats all
3742694 ok but the same is obviously true for all other peoples not just the bani israel plus the quran does permit the jewish religion
3742695 no his people were granted a land not his followers not all of the children of israel were always followers of moses as the quran points out
3742696 o my people call in remembrance the favour of allah unto you when he produced prophets among you made you kings and gave you what he had not given to any other among the peoples
3742697 o my people enter the holy land which allah hath assigned unto you and turn not back ignominiously for then will ye be overthrown to your own ruin
3742698 yes they did at times however the jewish religion is permitted per the quran and it is entirely possible for the jews to return to a acceptable faith the quran actually says that the children of israel occasionally twice went astray and were punished whether the jews have to return to islam or judaism is not clear from the quran if you want to take the title to the land away i guess you would have to prove that judaism wouldnt be good enough
3742699 well you did say that the title to the land was given to the children of israel because of their faith and was hence taken away again when they allegedly lost their faith
3742700 apart from the fact that the quran does mention that the children of israel occasionally return to their faith for example after the first exile punishment the quran does not say that the title to the land was taken away at any point the title was certainly not taken away during or after the first punishment
3742701 however the quran does say that the jewish religion was a true religion which means that jews or children of israel could very well be true enough in their faith to keep the title to the land even if they were not muslims
3742702 today i have completed for you your religion and chosen islam for you as your religion
3742703 and that assumes that the title would be lost if the jews lose their faith which is something the quran doesnt say even though it was written 600 years after that event would have taken place jesus birth and even though the quran specifically predicts that the children of israel would return
3742704 none of this would prove an arab title to the land however even if it might put doubt on the jewish title which i still dont think it has
3742705 the point is that the quran does tell us that g d gave the right to live in the land to the children of israel and that you have yet to prove that he took that right away again
3742706 incidentally it is ruled by the bani israel so you can either accept the qurans prediction that the children of israel will return as fulfilled or you can worry that the quran failed to predict that the bani israel will rule the land again thats up to you
3742707 scatter and live all over the world and when the end of the world is near we will gather you again into the promised land
3742708 to this ahmad says it was all contingent on jews staying in converting to islam
3742709 on the bright side the title of bani israel stays with us hopefully if i get it right and the title of the sons of apes and pigs too the last one being of a particular importance to me
3742710 wait wait and whats about this i have just found it in your another post
3742711 scatter and live all over the world and when the end of the world is near we will gather you again into the promised land
3742712 you know ahmad after this discussion of children of israel in the koran i am now thinking that its so not much our problem to persuade you that its us rather its more like your problem to convince yourselves that its not us
3742713 i find it very hard to believe in particular given the attitude of islam towards people of the book its probably true that islam sees itself as a superior religion but the tolerance towards people of the book plainly stems from the fact that being a jew or christian is not that bad according to islam if every jew and christian were doomed to spiritual perdition they would have not been allowed to continue practicing their religions under islam of course as a muslim you should know better but you have no idea how much my opinion of islam has suffered in the wake of this discussion not that it was very high from the beginning but nevertheless i was simply amazed to hear this
3742714 is it indeed a consensus among major scholars and does the koran state it explicitly that all christian or jew are doomed
3742715 sons of apes and pigs are a part of our folklore and slang now its our trademark dont touch it
3742716 if you ever decide like rewriting your holy book please leave that part as it is
3742717 the weird zionistic biased translation was quoted on your another post titled fascinating perspective so what happened now you dont find that perspective fascinating any longer
3742718 by the way if we are on this what was about this haneefs that they were considered muslims and how is that different from jews or whatever in fact if one could be muslim before muhammads prophesy then what makes a person a muslim
3742719 dwell in the land when the promise of reckoning comes we shall bring you together from a motley crowd
3742720 dwell now securely in the land which god has decreed for you and commanded you to enter but when the time for the fulfillment of the last decree comes we will bring you as a mixed crowd gathered from disparate nations
3742721 reside in this land then when the promise of the hereafter comes we will bring you all huddled together
3742722 and when the end of the world is near we will gather you again into the promised land
3742723 but when the promise of the hereafter cometh to pass we shall bring you as a crowd gathered out of various nations
3742724 so when the hour judgement day comes and that is what is meant by
3742725 gathered assembled crowded throngig multitude crowd swarm body cluster group min of people mixed company
3742726 that is what is best for the jews but not necessarily what our religion has assigned for us
3742727 ignoring that now the jews happen to live in israel and changing that is not a suitable solution would it be theoretically acceptable if the state were located elsewhere
3742728 incidentally if umar had understood the quran text to mean that g d took away the jewish right to live in israel he wouldnt have called on jews to return from the exile would he clearly umar thought that the jews had a right to live in israel and thats exactly what the zionists believe d
3742729 but the link just repeats what you ve been saying all the time and this is that ever since muhammad no salvation is possible for non muslims unless the message of muhammad has not reached them
3742730 now i used to think that this is a matter of common knowledge or better universal spiritual intuition that not only having the right doctrine does not guarantee a thing to anybody but some people manage to get it right even when operating under false premises and concepts
3742731 its also about restoring the culture the language and the only place to which we felt a tie and in which we could start such a restoration was the land
3742732 the ones who wanted to found the country purely out of security based considerations were the entirely secularized and near entirely assimilated european jews they were the ones who wanted to just emulate the european national model for the jews but somewhere safer than europe
3742733 creating the state of israel would be ending the exile and only god would do that

3742795 crossovers are an increasingly important part of our business and ford is going to continue developing an expressive range of these vehicles
3742796 the ford airstream concept is a futuristic look at crossovers its the ultimate modern touring vehicle that delivers flexibility and capability with dynamic design that evokes the spirit of the journey
3742797 for 75 years airstream has been an icon synonymous with the optimism discovery and wanderlust thats helped defined america
3742798 it seemed only fitting for us to come together through our shared passion for the open road and show a vision for the future of american transportation
3742799 business for airstream and the rv industry has been strong but we want to continue finding options for tomorrows road trips our success in recent years has come from challenging the conventional thinking about what an airstream is the ford airstream concept is a stunning example of just that
3742800 plus a partner like ford with its long history as an american icon made perfect sense for this kind of exploration
3742801 this reflects the purpose of the vehicle looking out and remembering that the journey not the destination matters most
3742802 the ford airstream concept is an ultra modern optimistic vehicle that allows passengers a pure traveling experience to enjoy with good company no matter the destination
3742803 through the materials color palette and technology the ford airstream concept has distinct cues from the spacecraft and environments portrayed in 2001 a space odyssey
3742804 were able to maximize the spaciousness of the interior creating a lounge atmosphere in contrasting colors of cosmic red and white that provides an inviting experience for the ultimate journey
3742805 inside outside and under the hood the ford airstream concept speaks to the future
3742806 ford is looking out onto the horizon and imbuing crossovers with emotion made even more powerful by our association with airstream
3742807 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3742822 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
3742823 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
3742824 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal wheres it going to go to
3742825 thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket

3742830 regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past three years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities
3742831 exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3742832 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3742833 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3742834 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3742835 instead of dreaming up ideas in london david camerons ignorant chums at policy exchange should let me show them round leeds the city with the fastest growing economy in the country

3742856 hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency

3742861 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3742862 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3742863 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3742864 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3742865 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3742866 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch

3742877 the harbor porpoise population is one of the most threatened species of whale and dolphin in europe and giving protection to this species was one of the primary objectives for the area

3742880 should the fines and price decrease be the only outcomes for mechel the company would suffer less than expected implying that the attack by prime minister vladimir putin was not politically motivated
3742881 it would be very bad sentiment wise as it would mean an effective price cap on coking coal prices and pose the question of what happens next will the government do the same for steel prices
3742882 of greater importance is the threat to lower domestic coking coal prices by 30 percent which would have far more serious consequences for mechel and the coking coal sector
3742883 over the last three years the company has successfully employed the practice of concluding long term contracts covering a period of no less than five years taking into account both the current and prospective demands of russian steel makers
3742884 while the plants copper production during the quarter was in line with our may 14 forecast cobalt output was less than expected
3742885 this together with current assessments of the time required to add needed residue filtration capacity at the plant make it prudent to reduce our production outlook for 2008
3742886 its a fantastic win we got stronger as the game went on
3742887 its nice to get through to the next round and hopefully we can get a big club and get some coffers in

3742889 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
3742890 children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom
3742891 that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their own arms
3742892 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a superior force to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states
3742893 we get as many calls from people who want to rent as those who need rooms

3742900 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3742904 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3742905 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3742906 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3742907 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration

3742966 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3742967 there was one guy convulsing we could not get him out because there were no seats in the back of the van
3742968 while warner music groups organic revenues continue to decline we are quite surprised to see mr cohen selling such a large block of stock at these levels
3742969 this sale reflects nothing more than a normal need for liquid assets for personal expenses as well as my financial advisers recommendation that i diversify my portfolio for tax and estate planning
3742970 you have to be realistic i have nothing against this guy its nonsense
3742971 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
3742972 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
3742973 i have really enjoyed this summer the ball has been coming out beautifully the speeds have stayed reasonably high and i have been taking wickets pretty consistently
3742974 milestones are lovely when they come along but my main target is to keep my place in the team
3742975 if i am taking wickets then they cannot leave me out that is how i have looked at it
3742976 but i now know im a good bowler who can perform at this level i have just been telling myself how good i am
3742977 i can think of a couple of times i have struggled a little bit during the first innings against new zealand at old trafford
3742978 apart from that i cant think of any time that i have felt like i have not bowled well or been in the game
3742979 its mainly down to me im the only guy that can keep drilling it into myself
3742980 it has also given me confidence that i have maintained my fitness which has helped keep my speeds up
3742981 four tests in five weeks is a good physical challenge and i came through that
3742982 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
3742983 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
3742984 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3742985 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3742986 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3742987 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3742988 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3742989 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3742990 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3742991 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

3743031 as he climbed out of his car he grabbed hold of something it was a memorial cross someone else had died in an accident at the very same spot
3743032 the car was a write off my daughters head hit the window on the passenger side but all three of them were able to get out and walk away from the car
3743033 that was a really bad week for us but even though the tree fell onto the hood the car would still start and it was still drivable although i have had to let it go as a result it was the apple of my eye it had done almost 500 000 miles

3743040 i realized this is a major way of communication for them
3743041 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not
3743042 there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help
3743043 when its so hard to reach these kids why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference
3743044 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
3743045 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
3743046 its a sad thing but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids
3743047 those predators are going to be there but most of the time there are warning signs and thats what we need to be working on getting those people out not stopping teachers who havent caused problems from reaching those who need help most

3743058 i was like i cant believe im on the floor
3743059 i was just so disappointed because i just didnt want to upset my team members
3743060 of course a gold could feel better but we are really proud of our silver we worked really hard for it and we couldnt be prouder of each other
3743061 thats the worst thing ever falling on your first skill in your beam routine
3743062 i got a little nervous because i was just eager to do my routine i think my nerves just got the best of me today
3743063 that shows that we are all human and were not robots and we are going to make mistakes
3743064 our sport is kind of like that you just tell her theres nothing you can do about it now so try to move on and try to go out there and take the rest of it
3743065 we had the idea we would not win the gold just because gymnastics is all about the tenths
3743066 i mean one tenth can mean first and one tenth can be second
3743067 the thing is china is so great we pretty much knew
3743068 this is not something that i invented or anybody has
3743069 china or any other of the former socialist countries they could make a passport in no time for any age or any kind of incident
3743070 i think one of the main things is maybe they havent had as many life experience
3743071 so maybe they dont grasp to the extent that someone like an alicia sacramone who has gone through high school and is even a college student she knows the ramifications of what shes about to do
3743072 oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh etc etc
3743073 the eu is ready to engage including on the ground to support the efforts of the united nations and the osce
3743074 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3743075 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3743076 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression
3743077 it would not be right to talk about these things
3743078 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3743079 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
3743080 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
3743081 remote sensing technology which makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas has gained prominence in recent years due to technological advances
3743082 this technology coupled with space and airborne imaging along with joint cooperation between authorities on both sides of the border can be used to protect both countries against organized crime money laundering and drug human and illegal arms trafficking although traditional border crossings have been tightened up since the 9 11 attacks criminals are now seeking easier access points
3743083 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3743084 we are reducing the time it takes for a new reseller to start selling our services

3743086 religious authorities in nepal have begun the search for a girl who could be as young as three or four to serve as the new kumari or the virgin
3743087 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3743088 in the old days life as a goddess was viewed as a route to a better life but nepal now has a constitution that guarantees equal rights to women and more women are getting educated and competing for jobs once held exclusively by men
3743089 being a kumari isnt good for ones marriage prospects either nepalese folklore holds that men who marry an ex goddess will die young and most of the eight living ex goddesses are unmarried

3743095 affirmative action continues to be a symbolic issue that people find very emotional
3743096 and because were not debating a specific policy proposal at the moment its an easy wedge issue that most every american has an opinion on so therefore the political mileage is gonna be a lot higher
3743097 i have been waiting for the way in which the mccain campaign would begin to begin to racialize the election
3743098 and i think this is perhaps the beginning of it im not suggesting that mccain is playing the race card at the moment but this is the beginning of a racialized sentiment being infused in the campaign
3743099 i dont think this is a specific effort to appeal to white voters anything john mccain is doing to emphasize color blindness or race neutrality is a recapitulation of the basic american ideal of equality
3743100 hes changed his mind and i think hes doing the right thing
3743101 affirmative action is not going to be the long term solution to the problems of race in america because frankly if youve got 50 percent of african american or latino kids dropping out of high school it doesnt really matter what you do in terms of affirmative action those kids arent going to college
3743102 with all the breathless coverage from abroad and with senator obama now addressing his speeches to the people of the world im starting to feel a little left out
3743103 nixon sold the new policy on tv as a rescue of the american economy from the attacks of international money speculators
3743104 in this case though mccain isnt reaching back merely to nixonian sentiment except in the fact that nixon himself was reaching back to an ugly old republican isolationism which had its heyday in the 1920s
3743105 im not interested in my standard of living my health my job my rights my freedoms my future or any future

3743109 we find that californias registered sc mark and carolinas baseball logo mark are legally identical in terms of appearance
3743110 we find that the similarity in appearance between the marks which results from the fact that both marks depict the letters sc and the fact that both marks depict these letters in interlocking form outweighs the dissimilarities between the marks in terms of the stylization of lettering and the different positioning of the interlocking letters
3743111 the question was whether the university of south carolinas baseball teams logo which is an overlapping sc could co exist on the trademark record

3743149 es realmente lastimoso para el pueblo de m xico y siento mucho referirme as sobre un mexicano pero en este caso el ex presidente fox realmente fue un ignorante al inmiscuirse en pol tica interna en el pa s
3743150 se ha referido aqu en nicaragua desde su tierra y se ha referido adem s en unas posiciones totalmente positivas
3743151 no estoy hablando que es injerencismo porque el injerencismo es de un gobierno pero vicente fox es un ex presidente y un ciudadano com n y corriente
3743152 el problema es que vino a hablar de democracia en am rica latina y se centr como en una cuesti n obsesiva en el presidente ortega y el presidente ch vez de venezuela
3743153 la presencia de este pol tico solamente demuestra la desesperaci n de la derecha nicarag ense patrocinada por el imperio norteamericano ante el avance de la revoluci n que lidera el frente sandinista

3743169 algunos magistrados hemos cerrado filas en contra de la candidatura de cuarezma por sus declaraciones diciendo que se han acomodado las estad sticas que se juega taba con los expedientes por intereses econ micos y pol ticos vulgarizando la imagen del poder judicial
3743170 todos en el plc saben que fue cuarezma el que en mayo o junio de 2005 ofreci la f rmula para que el doctor alem n pudiera circular por todo el pa s a trav s de la convivencia familiar y se lo hizo saber primero al doctor mauricio mart nez y despu s se reuni con l y el doctor alem n para definir la estrategia
3743171 tiene grandes atribuciones de control y poder sobre un mbito que genera gran tensi n e intereses pol ticos y econ micos como los casos de propiedad y su nombramiento representa un obst culo para los fines de quienes se oponen
3743172 respeto a todos los magistrados creo en su dignidad nunca he visto que se negocie nada es decir en el sentido de lo il cito se discuten criterios nunca he visto negociar sentencias en el sentido econ mico de venta de justicia puedo dar fe de eso porque nunca lo he visto

3743181 there are no signs of any prolonged spell of settled weather just yet
3743182 north and west areas of the country are likely to see more showers over the next few days and there will be one or two in the south as well
3743183 in previous augusts last year excepted we have got used to quite nice weather at this time of the month but its not looking that way this year

3743188 we wouldnt have entered into this transaction if we didnt have a case we believed in
3743189 were going to work very diligently with the relevant agencies in their reviews
3743190 what we did within our four walls we were able to control
3743191 but i can tell you the month of june was pretty tough and a lot of the extra cream if you like was not there
3743192 we have seen during the second half of last year one month strong one month weak they shop retreat take some oxygen and then come back the month after perhaps that pattern will continue
3743193 at the right price i think now potentially is a very good time
3743194 other competitors to the merged entity which remain in the market will continue to play a similar role
3743195 the accc acknowledges the role that regional banks have played in challenging the major banks particularly as they have entered new states and competed aggressively to gain market share
3743196 we came to the conclusion yesterday that given where markets are it would not be prudent to go ahead with the due diligence
3743197 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3743198 the economic slowdown yes its significant but a slowdown of 1 2 from 8 5 last year its not so serious its not a recession
3743199 inflation is accelerating everywhere the worst case is in vietnam where its 28 its 11 in indonesia and the philippines 7 to 8 in china thailand and even malaysia inflation is the number one challenge for many countries and its difficult
3743200 this inflation disproportionately affects poor people because poor people spend a higher proportion of their income on food and energy
3743201 our estimate is that the 1 2 billion poorest people in asia spend about 60 of their income on food and 15 on energy its really huge and those prices went up sharply this inflation has seriously affected poor people
3743202 if you really wish to help poor people you can provide targeted income support to the poor rather than universally subsidising fuel consumption
3743203 this simply aggravates the imbalance between supply and demand and it is very costly
3743204 all our funding is leveraged with the private sector the government or other donors
3743205 for private sector projects we provide up to 20 of funding through direct investment or lending
3743206 but theyre not on the other side of the world theyre right across the strait
3743207 weve been in a difficult process of restructuring for years
3743208 for us the new jobs are in services and high tech manufacturing we are trying to make taiwan a regional financial centre in asia taiwanese financial institutions should be able to go to china and service small and medium sized firms
3743209 with people spending a bit more time at home foxtel becomes more valuable to them and represents a really good in home entertainment proposition
3743210 our biggest friend is word of mouth so as we get more of the hd product in to the community people talk about it
3743211 we saw hd as being a fundamental must have particularly seeing the terrestrial networks are all investing in hd roll out of varying merits and we need to match it
3743212 some of the most enlightened planning systems in the country
3743213 even after the events of the past 12 months which included interest rate rises and the us subprime mortgage crisis weve managed to hold our own
3743214 for victoria weve locked in nine months worth of production and those lots have already been sold the victorian government is prepared to move urban growth boundaries so weve always got a 15 year supply in front of us
3743215 we think such a rise would reduce luxury car sales by around 20
3743216 the world is a more difficult place at the moment
3743217 some of our businesses especially in the us have been doing it pretty tough in the last six to nine months such as transactional ones the mutual fund and corporate proxy solicitation businesses
3743218 we came to the conclusion on tuesday that given where markets are it would not be prudent to go ahead with the due diligence
3743219 if you are a bank generating significant profits those banks owe it to working australians who are under financial pressure that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3743220 often used as an indicator of the banks marginal costs of funds
3743221 i think over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rate has down around half a per cent
3743222 that has significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding that means that there is no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate

3743224 the yen is being bought against higher yielding currencies by japanese investors
3743225 they are worried over slowing economies and interest rate reductions in australia and new zealand
3743226 australia looks to be facing lower prices for the key commodities that it exports
3743227 that means less demand for the aussie dollar which would temper the pace of improvement in australias trade position
3743228 no one knows how significant the decrease will be but theyre betting that it will be more significant than less
3743229 if thats the case then logic should dictate that the ongoing earnings power of those companies should be less because they have fewer assets upon which to earn money
3743230 that has implications for the extension of credit and the deployment of capital by those institutions
3743231 you think you make any money in investment banking away from this part of it
3743232 investment bankers are loss leaders youre paying these very ordinary guys 2 million dollars 3 million million and a half for what
3743233 they do one deal a year maybe your balls are on the line with the leveraged lending part of it and you dont get paid for the risk you get to the point where thats your business and your business is flawed
3743234 massive sea change salvation i dont see it hope hope exists hope it comes back
3743235 that is why the people are happy that u s forces are doing this
3743236 they have asked for our assistance and we have been able to provide it
3743237 and the reason we are able to provide it is because we have this great cooperation with the afghan army the police our british allies and of course our troops are out here doing a fantastic job as well
3743238 we have worked with the u s before at the ali khail school when i first got here in may
3743239 enjoying working together once again supporting each other and the afghan national security forces to make things a bit safer
3743240 we are just the outer piece and they are doing the real hard work of making sure that anyone who gets into the clinic to be seen incidentally by afghan doctors are secure
3743241 we go to the shuras meetings to talk to the elders about the health problems of the men women and children of the community
3743242 we allow them to take care of their people we provide the medications and advice on prescribing and then dispersing them
3743243 the primary thing we need built in our area is a clinic
3743244 and now we are happy that the u s forces will build a clinic in the village for us and they are already starting to work on it
3743245 camp phoenix is our neighbor when we are meeting and discussing different issues security and clinic schools bridges ditches they are the only organization helping us
3743246 and when we need to talk about the issues if we give them a call they invite us sometimes we invite them because we think they are from our own village they are part of our own people
3743247 i thought the commonwealth bank result was pretty good especially in the context of a very difficult general operating environment with credit markets essentially malfunctioning for the better part of the reporting period
3743248 the number of companies surprising on the upside is well down on past years
3743249 its part of the tougher more uncertain environment weve come into
3743250 we have a number of competitors which have different issues on their plate we are working on a number of opportunities
3743251 the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict

3743254 these cuts are not simply fiscal in nature as the foreign affairs department would have us believe since studies have shown that every dollar invested in canadian culture brings 10 into the canadian economy taxes alone replenish dfaits original investment the programs are an investment that realizes huge returns to federal and provincial coffers

3743261 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3743262 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3743263 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3743264 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3743265 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3743266 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3743267 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3743268 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3743269 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution

3743339 the purpose of the necp is to promote the ability of emergency response providers and relevant government officials to continue to communicate in the event of natural disasters acts of terrorism and other man made disasters and to ensure accelerate and attain interoperable emergency communications nationwide
3743340 dhs acknowledges there is no simple solution or silver bullet for solving emergency communications challenges
3743341 the nation does not have unlimited resources to address deficiencies in emergency communications for that reason the necp will be used to identify and prioritize investments to move the nation toward this vision
3743342 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3743343 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3743344 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3743345 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3743346 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3743347 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3743348 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3743349 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3743350 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3743351 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3743352 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3743353 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3743354 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3743355 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3743356 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3743357 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3743358 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3743359 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3743360 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3743361 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3743362 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3743363 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3743364 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3743365 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3743366 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3743367 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3743368 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3743369 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3743370 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3743371 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3743372 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3743373 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3743374 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3743375 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3743376 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3743377 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3743378 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3743379 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3743380 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3743381 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3743382 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3743383 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3743384 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3743385 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3743386 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3743387 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3743388 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3743389 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3743390 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3743391 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3743392 who are open to doing something on the production side
3743393 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3743394 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3743395 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3743396 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3743397 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3743398 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3743399 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3743400 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3743401 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3743402 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3743403 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3743404 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3743405 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3743406 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3743407 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3743408 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3743409 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3743410 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3743411 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3743412 i do enjoy the perez i mean thats really the only one i read just because i think its funny to draw stuff on peoples faces
3743413 in july we saw a rebound in furniture sales and electronics after a drop in june so the tax rebates may have helped a little but not every aspect of consumer spending

3743416 espa a camina hacia una crisis que recuerda demasiado a lo que ocurri en argentina en el a o 2001 responsables del banco de espa a est n negociando con el banco central europeo medidas de rescate que puedan poner fin a esta crisis crediticia
3743417 spain is sliding into a crisis that looks all too like the early stages of argentinas debacle in 2001
3743418 mi previsi n es que la protesta pol tica marcar la siguiente fase de este drama cerca de medio mill n de personas han perdido su empleo durante este ltimo a o en alg n momento el sentimiento de impotencia nacional ante la pol tica monetaria de frankfurt tornar en una masa enfurecida el banco central europeo tendr que tragarse su orgullo y suavizar su pol tica monetaria o encarar su propia destrucci n
3743419 my guess is that political protest will mark the next phase of this drama
3743420 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3743421 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3743422 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3743423 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3743424 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3743425 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3743426 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3743427 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3743428 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3743429 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3743430 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3743431 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3743432 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3743433 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3743434 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3743440 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3743441 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3743442 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3743443 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3743444 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscapewhat color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
3743445 commercial broadcast tv had a record breaking first six months of 2008 total commercial impacts were up 6 on the same period last year 15 growth over the last five years
3743446 broadcast tv revenues held firm in the first half of 2008 and whatever the economic climate holds for the advertising market i hope these figures will underline the great strength and resilience of commercial tv advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3743447 revenues from our jupiterimagesunlimited high level royalty free subscription offering grew over 90 from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2008
3743448 we also continue to experience significant growth from our stockxpert com microstock offering both with single images and subscriptions our backlog for both jupiterimagesunlimited and our stockxpert com microstock subscription offerings continue to increase which bodes well for future revenues

3743479 congressman poe and i had a very informative meeting with representatives from the west brook bus crash families today these parents have undergone tremendous heartache yet they continue to fight tirelessly to improve bus safety standards in texas and across the country
3743480 their tragedy and the recent fatal accident in sherman that took the lives of 17 members of a houston church group underscore the importance of addressing bus safety as quickly as possible to prevent future tragedies whether its in the area of manufacturing licensing or law enforcement bus safety reform is an issue i will push the senate to review immediately and comprehensively
3743481 i want to continue this important dialogue with advocacy groups like the west brook bus crash families to ensure their concerns are being heard on the federal level church groups sports teams and other groups traveling in motor coaches or school busses need the assurance that their government leaders are taking every possible step to ensure their safety my thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who were killed in sherman last week and also to the west brook parents who continue to cope with the tragic losses and injuries that occurred in 2006
3743482 i am proud to work with senator cornyn on this important issue recent tragedies reinforce the need to promote effective bus safety i have asked the chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee highways subcommittee to hold a hearing on this topic immediately when congress reconvenes in september our hearts go out to the west brook families here today the vietnamese community and the victims and families involved in last weeks tragedy in sherman and we will not stand for these tragedies to continue we must make the safety of our families a top priority

3743536 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers

3743545 we were simply following a procedure that the fcc had communicated in a public briefing several years ago
3743546 there is no rule establishing 11 a m as the appropriate time to file first come first served applications granting intelsats motion to dismiss echostars applications would impose a draconian penalty i e loss of an orbital slot on a provider with a relatively small fss fixed service satellite business and reward the large incumbent
3743547 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any national football game
3743548 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
3743549 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals
3743550 i dont understand why the journalists all of a sudden discovered the potential of a merger of echo dish network formerly echostar with direct directv
3743551 weve talked about it frequently in the past it would be very synergistic if it were doable however we dont see that the regulatory environment has changed since the last time we made comments on the subject we think it would be problematic to try and merge the two companies in the current regulatory environment
3743552 as far as dish and dtv directv im not sure exactly why that got such a round of enthusiastic media investor attention over the last two three weeks
3743553 there really hasnt been anything thats occurred or changed the market conditions other than potentially some people projecting on the impact or the foretelling of a sirius xm merger and what it might mean i dont know whats changed or whether that could be done obviously there are a ton of synergies out there that deal had challenges once whether it could be done today in a different environment i dont know enough about
3743554 for advertisers to prosper they need competitive markets we think google is a fantastic company our sense is that if the transaction with yahoo proceeds theres the potential the development of yahoo ad system panama and other competing systems will atrophy over time
3743555 we like to see a healthy market with lots of players and competition
3743556 if this gives more volume than converts its a good thing for advertisers
3743557 we had so many songs we were excited about that we briefly threw around the idea of just putting out a double record instead we decided to take a group of songs that fit with each other and turn that into the stage names setting the rest aside for a future release a the stage names sequel
3743558 i dont need a million people to see my things just the right people who have hopefully good taste to buy my things
3743559 youre always taking a risk with sellers from sites like these
3743560 unless there are guarantees or some seller ratings like the ones ebay has accumulated over time there will always be some bad experiences
3743561 they lost focus all their money comes from sellers buyers are what drive the market but you need quality and protection for the sellers or else they dont even want to deal with the buyers
3743562 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
3743563 they come in and say we were going to get married anyway but right now we really need the insurance
3743564 there may be an unplanned pregnancy or there is an illness or theyve lost their job and cant get insurance
3743565 im running out of family members to pay for it
3743566 i felt the only way i could get around this was to marry him
3743567 i love him a lot and i want to marry him
3743568 i just dont want to be forced to marry him early for insurance purposes
3743569 and i know i want to spend the rest of my life with her the reasons and how fast we do it thats just secondary
3743570 i wasnt sure what was going to happen with either the prognosis or the financial side of it
3743571 he didnt want me to be without health care coverage because id never had it without him
3743572 hed always been the breadwinner and i always worked two or three days a week and raised the children
3743573 we had worked hard our entire lives and if this was all the insurance we had we could become homeless
3743574 from a male point of view you want to be able to fix things you want to be able to provide
3743575 then you start looking at what things cost and what someone with no assets can get in terms of funding and you have to start thinking about it
3743576 but im not going to divorce you and im not going to let you die
3743577 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3743578 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3743579 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3743580 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3743581 las ventas minoristas fueron golpeadas por el sector automotor los altos precios de la gasolina han golpeado las ventas de autos los reembolsos impositivos no ayudaron al sector

3743583 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3743584 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3743589 mythological symbols touch and exhilarate centers of life beyond the reach of vocabularies and coercion
3743590 the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value
3743591 the development of new ideas and their economic application as new products or processes
3743592 though the outcomes of successful innovations appear random the processes that result in their success often are not
3743593 he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new
3743594 the true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who preached it but the vanderbilts carnegies and rockefellers

3743603 the agreement gives ener1 sole ownership of crucial assets at an important time in this rapidly growing industry
3743604 it gives us more freedom and greater opportunity to bring innovations to market faster and at lower cost the transition also paves the way for new strategic partnerships something we have long said is a key competitive objective
3743605 the market demands new technology from suppliers particularly now when the need to transition away from fossil fuels is great this is an opportunity for us to unlock important resources and bring them into play quickly and competitively
3743606 these results show that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3743607 the results of this study could change the way breast cancer patients are treated
3743608 the good news is the that the two treatments are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic
3743609 establishing the most effective combinations of drug treatments and the timings in which they are given is an important area of clinical research
3743610 but the benefits of giving zoledronic acid after doxorubicin have only been shown here in mice and now need to be evaluated more fully in people with breast cancer
3743611 apart from short sections in the prison service orders on disability and women there remains no national strategy for older prisoners
3743612 there is still far too much reliance on the unsupported initiative of particularly committed officers and too great an assumption that the care of older prisoners including their social care is a matter for health services and not for the whole prison
3743613 an ageing prison population is being squeezed into overcrowded jails designed and run for young men
3743614 as well greater use of community punishments for older offenders ministers should also consider developing specialist secure accommodation for the elderly in cases where a custodial sentence is necessary
3743615 the national offender management service has felt to date that a national strategy for older prisoners was not appropriate
3743616 ministers in the current labour cabinet overwhelmingly represent inner city areas a future cabinet perhaps more representative of suburbs and the wealthy south east may not have the same commitment to high levels of regeneration funding particularly if economic circumstances demand a squeeze on public spending

3743619 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3743620 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3743621 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3743622 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3743623 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3743624 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3743625 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3743626 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3743627 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3743628 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3743629 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3743630 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3743631 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3743632 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3743638 its all still experimental but it shows we have the capacity to create these organs for transplant
3743639 the hope is that if you have a baby diagnosed prenatally with a defect then you can take cells from the amniotic fluid and then expand those cells in large quantities and create the tissue or organ that is needed
3743640 you could turn the cells for example into liver cells and have them ready for when the baby is born
3743641 any abnormality that would not be lethal before a baby is born
3743642 we take the ink cartridge of an inkjet printer and instead of filling it with ink we fill it with cells and modify the printer so instead of putting paper through it it just prints off layer after layer of the tissue
3743643 this is a dreadful dreadful thing this has come as a major shock to everyone

3743645 hes always been that sort of guy that you knew would make it to the top in racecalling and sports broadcasting in general
3743646 i spoke to him in the lead up to the olympics and he was really excited about it and wide eyed he couldnt wait for the opportunity
3743647 this is due to the contractual arrangements struck between transurban and the kennett government
3743648 the authors of this report have themselves admitted it is barmy it isnt it is insane regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past 3 years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities

3743671 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

3743683 one can hardly imagine medvedev venturing an outright u turn in policy
3743684 but he has clearly taken the wheel and is trying to steer it stronger than one might think he would
3743685 medvedev has created his anti corruption council which could turn into a powerful tool and set the ball running in reforming the judicial system

3743700 and his subject matter was so different from everyone elses i think we helped him clarify some of his very unusual metaphors which american readers didnt really get but he was already a poet when he started the class

3743735 a party seeking to secure a loan from a collateral loan broker uses personal property typically jewelry as collateral the borrower is required to affirm in writing that he or she is the owner of the property
3743736 only a relatively small number of collateral loan broker transactions involve stolen property
3743737 career criminals are well aware of the record keeping requirements regarding property pledged to a collateral loan broker nevertheless in instances where a collateral loan broker without knowledge receives stolen property as collateral from the general public the collateral loan broker must return the property to the true owner and in virtually all cases is unable to recover anything from the wrongdoer
3743738 transactions with secondhand dealers are analogous to loans from collateral loan brokers
3743739 this bill would help reduce the frequency of these cases by increasing the likelihood of prosecutions and will also help the collateral loan broker and a secondhand dealer in his or her effort to secure recovery from the wrongdoer since restitution oftentimes can be included as a condition of probation
3743740 it was not intended to impact or to focus on the auction galleries or the antiques dealers

3743759 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3743760 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3743761 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3743762 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit

3743792 i know a little bit about his character and everything is as advertised it is evidenced by the way his teams have played that he is very structured in the defensive zone
3743793 if you take a close look at what scott has done with young players at providence you dont have that kind of success without patience
3743794 i just felt he was the best fit for our organization just because youre in the nhl doesnt mean youre done developing scott has a track record of developing young players

3744035 it is a fact well known and often recognized that those christians who have paid the most scrupulous attention to the word of god as the standard of character have attained to the highest degree of moral excellence they have been the most humble and penitent because they have seen the most clearly how small the measure of their holiness and how many their failings and sins the pride of their hearts has been continually mortified by looking at themselves in the light of gods holy word they have had the strongest faith in christ because they have had the deepest conviction of their own sinfulness and misery and helplessness and the clearest views of his glory and fulness they have been the most sincere and fervent in prayer because by making the scriptures their rule they have become the most deeply sensible of their poverty and of the abundance of blessings they need the most sensible too that no one but god can bestow these blessings and particularly that they must trust in him alone to supply what is wanting in their christian character thus they have been brought to feel a strong attachment to the throne of grace and to be importunate and persevering in prayer such christians have been the most obedient to the divine commands the most active in doing good and the most patient and submissive under trials because the word of god has most effectually taught them that such obedience and activity and submission is a reasonable service and is to be regarded as the very substance of practical religion and the grand proof of regeneration
3744036 we dont have enough information to have complete judgment about the conflict

3744045 if a product has passed fda scrutiny tort lawyers in mississippi or delaware have less legal room to gin up their own case against the manufacturer using state liability laws
3744046 the fda approval process is infamously labyrinthine requiring years and tens of millions of dollars in investment to prove a device is safe and effective if democrats want tort lawyers and juries of laymen to be the ultimate arbiters of new devices then they should do away with the fda entirely and go to an underwriters laboratory system that gets devices to patients more rapidly instead they want it both ways agonizingly slow device approvals and open tort season after the fact
3744047 on this list of 30 things pick the three youre best at
3744048 screen doors chickens or high tech i have no idea what you actually do
3744049 i get the sense that you really want to fix this company but to do so you need to be relieved of your day to day responsibilities of managing the group you have so youre out looking for someone that can run circles around the team members you have and get them to rise to the occasion while you spend time on grander improvements if the previous interviewer is an example of the standards of this group i am your guy as i bet a week in i can be many times more productive than they are and get them scared if this is true i am interested in this job
3744050 if you arent totally committed to sticking it out and really making changes in this company when you bail i wont last 10 minutes as they will eat me alive as soon as you are gone and i dont want this job so my question to you are you truly committed to change and do you believe its possible in this company or are you just bullsh tting me and yourself

3744074 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and dick cheney get re elected four years ago
3744075 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign

3744077 lucas and mccallum have hired three australian screenwriters to work on what is believed to be the first 22 episodes of a clone wars live action tv series and in a daring creative move lucas has moved out of his comfort zone by hiring three sydneysiders not known for science fiction writing tony mcnamara fiona seres and louise fox the three have distinguished records in adult dramas most particularly as co writers on the acclaimed drama series love my way mcnamara is also known for his stage works for the sydney theatre company including the recruit the unlikely prospect of happiness and most recently the great and as a screenwriter and director of the feature film the rage in placid lake seres has co written recent adult dramas including pay tvs dangerous and satisfaction fox has written for comedy series such as full frontal and comedy inc as well as the acclaimed childrens series round the twist their commission hints at a star wars thats very different from the films and animated series while sydney has become known inside hollywood as a top class city in which to film science fiction thanks to the expertise local crews developed on star wars the matrix and farscape mcnamara seres and fox have no obvious sci fi experience theyre learning fast though all three were in the us last week attending a star wars convention and were restricted from comment by lucasfilm
3744078 a bit of star wars related chat this morning on bbc radio 1 uk national radio station

3744087 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3744088 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3744089 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3744090 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3744091 there are people who dont agree with something and they try to express themselves you have people like this in your country
3744092 i think that these sorts of discussions which bring together philosophers neuroscientists biologists and ecologists that try to analyse the fundamental issues in these areas using philosophical tools are very important if we are going to understand what the science is telling us
3744093 i think the conclusions of the papers that have been presented here are much more nuanced than just the broad claim that conscious will is an illusion some of the papers were trying to make room for a concept of free will that is larger than something measured in milliseconds even if it is just a sense that we have some control over the way we are doing something or acting
3744094 despite certain interpretations of the neuroscience this is something at a very pragmatic and personal level which we need to think about and for which we need to find some kind of explanation
3744095 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world

3744101 its interesting that when your boyfriend shared his fantasy with you you jumped right to the term cuckolding
3744102 by definition a cuckold is a married man whose wife cheats on him behind his back a cuckold fetishist on the other hand not only knows about his wifes dalliances but often enjoys the humiliation of being forced to watch his wife bang the other dude or dudes
3744103 nothing about responsible non monogamy involves a free pass of any sort
3744104 its absolutely possible for you to transform your monogamous relationship into one thats nonmonogamous but you need to sit down and hash out the details including whats okay and whats not

3744117 i was driving down folsom street in san francisco and i got a dropped call 10 times i get dropped calls just standing in one place im extremely annoyed but im hopeful a software update will fix it
3744118 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3744119 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3744120 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3744121 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie sic we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3744122 i want to see the earth from a different perspective
3744123 sometimes it takes someone outside of our normal circle of friends and family to shine a light in our direction and help us along
3744124 as i set out on this bike ride and try to make the learning practical and fun i hope to also show students that it takes commitment and effort both mental and physical to accomplish your goals
3744125 the georgian air defense system is much less networked than that of the syrians and therefore relies on autonomous sector operations
3744126 we have to make choices and set priorities people have been mucking around trying to avoid the word rationing but we would like a whole public debate

3744128 unseemly being from a morally robust wartime generation and reading the times daily she was aware of greater needs unmet
3744129 think about it this way many of the voters who right now won t vote for obama because he s black would probably vote for colin powell even though he s black
3744130 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3744131 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3744132 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3744133 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3744134 about the burn clinic for children at csc scania in iraq it is operated by volunteers from the us military and using donated medical supplies sgt joseph barzeski of 3rd squadron 73rd cavalry regiment 1st brigade combat team 82nd airborne division is the current ncoic but the clinic was started by 1st battalion 125th field artillery 34th brigade combat team minnesota national guard it began as a family practice clinic for the local iraqis but as time went on the medics saw more and more burn victims due to the high number of cooking and heating accidents common in iraq

3744136 the taliban movement has warned that we would react across the country

3744158 pada poin ini saya kira tidak ada solusi bagus apakah itu dengan memaksa pergi pasukan rusia atau menerima kekalahan memalukan
3744159 ini saatnya untuk mengonsolidasi gencatan senjata memang normal bahwa rusia membela wilayah penutur bahasa rusia namun normal juga bahwa komunitas internasional ingin jaminan atas integritas kedaulatan dan kemerdekaan georgia
3744160 kami siap bekerja sama dengan negara negara lain seperti as perancis atau finlandia untuk membawa perdamaian

3744179 it doesnt seem like they the reds know what theyre doing
3744180 i think the public is probably unaware that many of the chemicals they use around their homes or the pharmaceuticals they take themselves ultimately end up in the natural environment and are very difficult to handle

3744185 we dont live in a police state we live under a government that should be informed by wisdom and discretion in enforcement of the laws and kathryn is deserving of the relief for which she seeks
3744186 the commonwealth fully supports action by the federal government to permit ms ingleson to remain in the united states and her continued residence in the commonwealth
3744187 the essential theme here is that this is a lady who had one contact with the law in her entire life
3744188 she was a law abiding person before this happened she has been a law abiding since this has happened she has worked hard and played by the rules
3744189 kathryn in terms of her allegiance and affinity would be lost in england
3744190 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3744191 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3744192 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3744193 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3744194 we feel that this game is the ea sports freestyle answer to a great wii party game it explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today

3744198 im surprised that mudavadi appears not in a hurry to fulfil his promise
3744199 im still eagerly waiting for the proper list of councillors
3744200 the otherwise hardworking town clerk john gakuo should agree that this is an obvious case of discrimination
3744201 all the adjacent roads including the road from globe cinema to ngara and forest road to museum hill have been recarpeted while kipande road is still full of potholes

3744203 the fringe board will commission an independent inquiry into the box office and the broader structure of the festival fringe society

3744223 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3744224 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3744225 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3744226 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3744227 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3744228 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3744229 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it

3744247 democrats ready to unload on mccain reed over atlanta fund raiser
3744248 calling yourself a maverick and claiming credit for fighting corruption while raising money with one of the central figures in the jack abramoff corruption scandal is not what most voters have in mind when they think of straight talk
3744249 it is however one more example of why john mccain is offering more of the same failed republican leadership
3744250 despite his shady ties to abramoff mccain never called reed to testify before his committee in fact despite acknowledging wrongdoing among his colleagues mccain refused to investigate fellow republicans in congress
3744251 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is is willing to go to win despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept tainted money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics a maverick no more the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3744252 im strongly supporting senator mccain because hes advocating conservative positions on taxes judges energy strengthening the family and common sense values i have great respect for his service to the country
3744253 i sent that e mail out in my capacity as a private citizen i dont hold any position or title with the mccain campaign havent sought one dont want one

3744264 mir fehlt die phantasie wo der vorteil f r die continental liegt
3744265 nicht zuletzt aus unternehmensstrategischen gr nden ist es nicht angemessen eine reine abwehrpolitik zu verfolgen
3744266 wenn denn ein schaeffler engagement strategisch sinnvoll ist dann kann nicht nur die h he einer beteiligung im fokus stehen vielmehr kommt es darauf an die bedingungen und modalit ten einer beteiligung vern nftig zu gestalten

3744278 ansonsten haben wir uns berall geeinigt aber ich kann doch nicht einen vertrag aushandeln und habe dann nicht einmal eine entscheidungsm glichkeit ob dieser gek ndigt wird oder nicht

3744280 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3744281 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3744282 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3744283 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3744335 a lot of this has caught the americans by surprise
3744336 politicians have been on the project of supporting democracy in the former soviet union without thinking of the impact in russia now were seeing a reaction
3744337 but now that it has come up against major opposition i think the inability of the u s to mount an effective response is going to call into question washingtons ability to push back
3744338 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
3744339 saakashvili made a huge mistake and soon these things should be discussed
3744340 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3744341 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3744342 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3744343 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3744344 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3744345 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3744346 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3744347 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3744348 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3744349 do not love the world or the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him 1st john 2 15

3744351 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
3744352 enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are
3744353 not a living being but is a symbol of evil
3744354 while he lived on earth jesus committed sins like other people
3744355 nevertheless when the son of man comes will he really find faith on the earth
3744356 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
3744357 when desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown brings forth death james 1 15 but
3744358 if anyone defiles the temple of god god will destroy him for the temple of god is holy which temple you are
3744359 for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
3744360 dear jesus i know that you are the son of god i believe you came and died and rose again to take away my sin i know that im a sinner jesus please forgive me of my sins wash me cleanse me and make me a new creation lord change my heart and my mind to follow after you fill me with your holy spirit jesus break the chains of my addictions and my habits that hurt me and those who are around me break the chains of religion and give me a right relationship with you lord guide me on my new path in life jesus be a light unto my path and a lamp unto my feet deliver me from this darkness that surrounds me lord may i know today what it means to be saved jesus i give you my life now please come into my heart in jesus name i pray amen

3744367 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3744368 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3744369 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3744370 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3744371 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3744372 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3744373 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3744374 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3744375 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3744376 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3744377 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3744378 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3744379 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3744380 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3744381 recognizes the value of thecompany and reflects the significant benefits that would accrueto roche as a result of full ownership
3744382 the credit markets get a little nervous when they believethat food and energy price inflation might spread
3744383 the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people
3744384 this commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
3744385 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
3744386 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3744387 im not going to talk about lindsay because because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old

3744390 the dearth of information available regarding the tradingstrategy and its impact upon the value of the debtors businesseshas caused significant unrest and concern among the debtorscustomers suppliers lenders and investors

3744480 we are happy that dean croushore who is well known for his work in real time data has agreed to serve as interim director of the center
3744481 the federal reserves ability to make better monetary policy decisions depends on studying past data and how they have been revised by studying those revisions we can help policymakers understand how to incorporate data revisions into their decision making
3744482 but the center goes far beyond the study of data revisions and includes much additional macroeconomic research that is relevant for monetary policy

3744511 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
3744512 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3744513 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3744514 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3744515 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3744516 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3744517 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3744518 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3744523 presumably david cameron will not fulfil his promise to withdraw conservative meps from the european peoples party grouping as that would entail loss of influence etc
3744524 we assume the conservatives will go along with the european project and with the lisbon settlement the uk has always in the past joined in albeit reluctantly and late
3744525 what can the uk do if lisbon has not been ratified by all countries
3744526 isnt the uk business community strongly pro the eu so doesnt that mean any new government will in practise have to go along with eu plans
3744527 surely the uk government will just accept what has gone before as it will want to have influence over the eu
3744528 isnt the uk worried that it might lose jobs and investment if it does not go along with the majority
3744529 wont the uk join the euro in due course once a few more years have passed showing it is a success
3744530 the uk should understand that lisbon marks the end of changing the institutional arrangements
3744531 the uk has to show some flexibility to be a good european after all france has to show flexibility on defence in return for the common agricultural policy germany allowed a wider range of countries into the euro than might have been sensible to show willing over european political union
3744532 now the eu has extra powers what is it going to do with them
3744533 under a future conservative government the european union will be divested of all authority and pre eminence over the united kingdom as is required by the 1689 bill of rights
3744534 euobserver also reports that declan ganley a prominent irish campaigner is currently touring europe to try and establish a new anti lisbon political group in time for the 2009 european elections
3744535 you may be surprised to hear that he agreed with me
3744536 well do what we want and you should be grateful anyway what do you think this is some kind of democracy
3744537 a very large number of us need to know the position of a conservative gov regarding the policy towards the uk fishing industry which as you well aware has been decimated by the current eu regulations

3744539 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3744540 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3744541 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3744542 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3744543 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3744544 today i think we have at least as good quality if not better than some independent schools because we have really joined the battle and use our money in a much better way
3744545 politicization of breast cancer which led initially to the carrying out of the studies is based on weak hypotheses and inadequate methods

3744547 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3744548 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3744563 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3744564 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3744565 due to the many caution periods it was a very difficult race for a time it appeared as if it would be very difficult for us to win however with a really good performance and thanks to audi tdi power we were able to achieve the result we wanted im happy for the team that we brought home this double victory and it was also a very nice audi d but for marcel f ssler
3744566 the strategy that we had in our minds before the race did not work out because of the many yellows nevertheless i was able to pull away quite well unfortunately we always lost the advantage we had due to the caution periods thank god in the end it was still enough to win im more than happy marcel f ssler must also be praised it was his first race with this car and he was able to catch the two acura hondas and thus make the audi 1 2 victory perfect this was again a great race weekend thanks to the team of audi sport north america to the boys at home and michelin
3744567 a beautiful 50th race the race was not easy especially after the penultimate restart with the two acura hondas in front of me behind these cars we lost a lot of down force so it was incredibly difficult to close the gap to them once i even went off the track at the end it worked well thanks to audi tdi power we got the acura hondas on the straights it was a nice race i spent a lot of time in the car it was a lot of fun
3744568 this was a very special race for me the final restart was unbelievable it was pretty close between brabham and the wall but i said to myself now or never it worked out i am very happy that i was able to give the second place to the team it ran very well from the beginning i am satisfied generally speaking the atmosphere at audi and in the american le mans series is perfect
3744569 im really happy it was a very good and interesting race with many yellows some helped us some did not help us i think we did a good job marcel f ssler drove very well and integrated really well into the team there is nothing to complain about and we can go home with a smile on our faces
3744570 this was a perfect day with excellent driving from all our drivers the team did not make any mistakes our strategy and pit stops were also good and both marco and marcel made great passes at the end of the race

3744578 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change

3744591 the most methodologically sound research indicates that among women who have a single legal first trimester abortion of an unplanned pregnancy for nontherapeutic reasons the relative risks of mental health problems are no greater than the risks among women who deliver an unplanned pregnancy
3744592 was consistent with normative rates of comparable mental health problems in the general population of women in the united states
3744593 a woman may think she wants to end a pregnancy may even feel relief when she does but she will suffer for it later so the state has a duty to stop her
3744594 the state must restrict abortion to protect womens mental health
3744595 her existing constitutional rights with regard to that relationship will be terminated

3744637 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3744638 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3744639 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3744640 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3744641 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion

3744651 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3744652 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3744653 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3744654 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together

3744658 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3744659 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3744660 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3744661 who are you how many hit records do you have

3744664 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
3744665 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3744666 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3744667 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3744668 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3744669 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3744670 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
3744671 im sure that im going to have to do some things differently

3744673 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3744674 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3744675 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3744676 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3744677 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3744678 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3744679 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3744680 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist

3744691 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time

3744694 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day

3744863 decorex again delivered on all expectations on whats new functional and fashionable in the d cor and home improvement industry there was an improvement of representation throughout the supply chain which allowed visitors the opportunity to feast on both a holistic and a detailed offering from our exhibitors
3744864 we were initially concerned about the possible impact of the current economic situation but it is now clear that home improvements are still a priority for the average south african our analysis also shows that decorex is not only an outing for leisure and window shopping as our exhibitors concluded many deals and we had a more balanced representation of visitors across the lsm grading there were also many international brands which clearly demonstrate that south africa is a focus market for global vendors together with oasys innovations we have stretched our creativity to present an exciting and comfortable environment for our exhibitors and our visitors
3744865 decorex is one of the stars of the exhibitions industry and we are pleased about the confidence thebe exhibitions and projects has demonstrated in us to once againprepare the infrastructure for such a large show the success can be attributed to several reasons including the seamless cooperation between the organiser and the infrastructure supplier most importantly however is thebes high investment in upfront marketing as in anything else the more you invest the more you get out the exhibition was extremely visible in many different modes of media with the consequence that decorex virtually became the talk of the town and the visitors were there in droves

3744867 what does change mean change is the democrats theme were going to change the greatest nation in the world
3744868 why didnt they push for the measure during the full swing of the building boom
3744869 this time we just said what do we want in this bill
3744870 you could think of a million things you could do better in terms of iraq probably at least a million
3744871 but its a question of where you put the focus and yes indeed what she has done helped focus that

3744885 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3744886 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3744887 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3744888 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3744889 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3744890 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3744891 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won

3744896 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3744897 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3744898 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3744899 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3744900 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3744901 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3744902 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by president dmitry medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3744903 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3744904 the terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful co existence in the country
3744905 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that

3744917 my daughter loves dogs and here she can see all kinds of breeds
3744918 my dog trainer told me i should bring him for socialization purposes
3744919 these social outings help the dogs not be aggressive as for the owners it makes them feel theyre not the only crazy person who loves dogs
3744920 the other day four young men showed up with one dog
3744921 its just a nice opportunity for people to be able to sit down and relax and bring their dogs with them so they dont stay at home with their dog

3744930 dat pater damiaan niet enkel een plaatselijke heilige is maar ook een universele betekenis heeft

3744932 net zoals lepra gaat aids gepaard met een stigmatisering van de zieke daarom wil de congregatie voor heiligverklaringen gehoor gevend aan die wens van johannes paulus ii pater damiaan uitroepen tot patroon van de aidspati nten
3744933 de datum voor de heiligverklaring wordt pas bepaald tijdens het volgend consistorie dat vindt wellicht pas in februari of maart plaats

3744938 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3744939 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3744940 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3744941 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3744942 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win

3744950 its a non factor in my performance to me its just a stat i still wanted to compete at the highest level regardless of age
3744951 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3744952 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3744953 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable its difficult to believe that the idf took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians as it is obliged to do under international law
3744954 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera

3744966 strong internal capital generation is a key strength of our business model and this will result in growth of the banks core equity in excess of 20 whilst continuing a progressive dividend policy
3744967 this inherent capital strength positions the bank well in the current testing environment for the sector where we expect credit impairment to rise and the higher cost of funding to remain

3744977 first of all this doesnt sound like scott it really doesnt not the scott mcclellan ive known for a long time it sounds like somebody else it sounds like a left wing blogger second of all youre right if he had these moral qualms he should have spoken up about them
3744978 scott we now know is disgruntled about his experience at the white house we are puzzled it is sad this is not the scott we knew
3744979 hes suggesting that we purposely misled there is no new evidence of that
3744980 we categorically deny the allegations in scotts book they are untrue and unsupported
3744981 its just a scarf the clueless keffiyeh wearers scoff would they say the same of fashion designers who marketed modified klan style hoods in burberry plaid as the next big thing

3744995 that sealing off ones own population against unwanted information and undesired contacts is not just a political declaration of bankruptcy but also cannot in the long term withstand peoples need for freedom
3744996 in the heart of the city authentic evidence of the wall and what it means is missing
3744997 how a demo is perceived may lie at a sensory encoding level as opposed to a cognitive level
3744998 when i was pitching a song to bonnie raitts producer he said they didnt want fully produced demos because they like to do whatever they want to songs with no preconceived ideas
3744999 but all of my demos were fully produced because of an intuition that a lot of people dont really know what they are listening for
3745000 music perception and cognition is a brand new area of research and conclusive results are just emerging
3745001 other factors the skill level of the musicians the mood and emotional state of the listener can also affect perception
3745002 but more complex signals do generate more excitation in the inner ear and brain so its possible that a fully produced demo could get a better reception because it causes more neurons to fire
3745003 that gives me an opportunity to hear my own interpretations
3745004 then we went to demo it in the studio and i realized while hearing the band play that the work tape was six to eight beats a minute too slow so we sped it up
3745005 because im a songwriter when im producing i can hear a good song whether its just a singer with a guitar or a full band
3745006 but i always do full productions of my own songs that im going to pitch including background singers in country music the bar is so high that you need to get your song across in the best way possible the greatest songwriters in the world are here in nashville vying for spots on big country albums every day and not every decision maker hears things the same way
3745007 some producers are wizards behind the board but they need to know what a finished song might sound like
3745008 a amp r staff may help pick tunes or management or maybe even the president of a record company if a label or artist is really going to bet on a song the marketing department might be asked for an opinion on whether radio will play it and chances are not all of those people are songwriters
3745009 if you really want to knock somebody out do you give them a shiny new car or the old one thats back in the shed
3745010 specifically its a blueprint for demo studio musicians beyond that with just one instrument one voice and a cheap digital recorder it might be all you need to bring a tune to life just be sure youre got the structure of the song tight
3745011 make sure your tempo is correct for the song and that its locked in
3745012 the groove has to be on the money for a song to be convincing
3745013 you need a believable vocal performance of a good melody
3745014 you dont want to get too over emotive this is a song driven market not a record driven market like rock n roll so youre just trying to get the spirit of a song across
3745015 sometimes there are five or more different writers at a session all splitting the cost to get good demos of their best tunes
3745016 in nashville the session musicians are the best in the world at getting demos done
3745017 songwriters are not usually producers but good musicians spend so much time in the studio playing on all kinds of songs that they often know exactly what youre going for listen to their ideas
3745018 theres no guarantee that artists managers or label people are going to hear your demos
3745019 youve got to get out there and make them interested in you
3745020 but come down here bring a book and read for awhile and then well walk home together

3745025 you should be suspicious of michelle because black people like her too much
3745026 the fact that as a successful black male barack did not choose a lighter skinned woman as most of them do sends a message to me
3745027 michelle is highly sophisticated yet she comes from the most humble background possible no one can say she grew up in marthas vineyard and shes not really black
3745028 ill tell you my personal philosophy about people if i want to know who you are i look at who you sleep with and who you give your name when i look at michelle barack doesnt have to be any blacker for me
3745029 im on vacation i rarely get a chance to be away from my wife like this you are a woman please help me to fulfill my desire to have a vacation romance as a way to confirm my manhood and by the way im not particularly interested in you as a person its just that notch in my belt that im looking for
3745030 what do you think i am your expectations are your own business i never told you to extend your trip
3745031 not surprisingly such a perspective is also often linked to an extremist end time obsession that acts as fertile ground for the planting watering and harvesting of all kinds of conspiracy theories related to such things as the anti christ the great apostasy and the so called coming one world government
3745032 extremists xenophobic paranoia isolationism reactionary isolating the mind from rational thought and logical analysis
3745033 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3745034 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3745035 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3745036 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3745037 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position

3745225 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3745226 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3745227 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3745228 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3745229 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3745230 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3745231 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3745232 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3745233 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3745236 we would like to have more open source applications on the maemo platform and giving these devices to the kde developers will help them write those besides its great to give to the f oss community we have used f oss software and products for a long time and have just begun to contribute back both in terms of code and sponsorship we realize our infrastructure depends on f oss developers to grow and we wanted to emphasize our commitment to the f oss community after all we are the largest mobile devices manufacturer who considers f oss a key asset and were heavily expanding our involvement focusing more on the qt development community
3745237 many kde hackers have been interested in developing applications for the maemo platform and now they can we welcome the maemo community to work with us on getting the power of kde available to maemo users

3745245 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3745246 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3745247 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3745250 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3745251 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3745252 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3745256 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3745257 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3745258 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3745259 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3745260 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3745261 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3745262 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3745271 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3745272 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3745273 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3745274 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3745275 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3745276 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3745277 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3745278 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3745279 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3745280 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3745281 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3745282 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3745283 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl

3745288 higgs work which invariably takes the form of framed book pages framed book covers and photographs of books might productively be thought of as a form of found conceptual art for more than 12 years higgs has worked within these self consciously defined but almost infinite parameters rooted in countless hours spent in second hand bookshops higgs re contextualization of existing printed matter seeks to consider questions of authorship uniqueness labor or lack thereof vandalism linguistics typography design and its relationship with late modernist abstraction amongst other things often making direct reference to the condition and reception of art higgs ongoing project formally acknowledges the presence and role of the viewer while simultaneously addressing the physical reality of the art object the exhibitions title is derived from the 1965 book art is to enjoy by donald walton

3745290 bulbous headed snub fin dolphin not a terribly endearing name was caught on film so i watched the video and loved the idea of posting on a normally attractive species i like those gotcha moments
3745291 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3745292 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3745293 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3745294 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3745295 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3745296 it occurred to me that i hadnt seen the phone bill come in the mail for a while
3745297 as difficult as our relationship was he was the love of my life
3745298 i know people who have been married 30 or 40 years who dont know the moments of happiness that he and i knew in our brief but turbulent marriage
3745299 ive known women in loving marriages who claim that they have lost their sexual appetite
3745300 but then when asked if brad pitt walked in the room and declared his love would they feel moved and the answer is most always yes
3745301 theyll say ive been a good girl all my life now its my time to have some fun
3745302 they say to themselves i can do this without getting caught without falling in love gosh i deserve this and i really want this
3745303 the six secrets of a lasting relationship how to fall in love again and stay there
3745304 women more often fall in love with someone else to feel adored and with a promise of protection and to ease pain
3745305 the rage and hurt in my heart was so intense i didnt want to do something stupid
3745306 its important to distinguish between a dead marriage and a dead patch
3745307 did you love each other before and do you love each other now
3745308 if its a dead marriage where you both barely even like each other it may be fates way of telling you to give up
3745309 one of the myths out there is that if someone cheats theyre going to do it again and again
3745310 most people just do it once and never again the guilt the fear that their partner will find out it consumes them
3745311 what the study found in scottsdale was that after they began the implementation of the pilot program which is now a permanent program the proportion of drivers traveling more than 10 mph over the speed limit dropped by 90 percent and we found similar a response in montgomery county in d c where it declined by 70 percent
3745312 its human behavior 101 if drivers believe theres a high likelihood of getting a ticket theyre more likely to slow down speeding is a major factor in highway crashes
3745313 theres a direct correlation between congestion and flow factors and accidents
3745314 the biggest problems are where backups occur cameras destroy the flow of the road any time a driver hits the brake and the one after him you completely destroy the flow and capacity of the road
3745315 everybody is worried about speed cameras and how they are used
3745316 none of it has anything to do with safety bottom line is its all about money
3745317 will remove from vc 21455 5 the requirement that an automated enforcement device be at an intersection and that will allow the devices to be put on freeways that change is accomplished by the repositioning of a 7 word phrase in vc 21455 5 a 2
3745318 in the u s the assumption is that people dont like speed cameras but we found in our surveys that in d c 51 percent of drivers favored speed cameras and 36 percent apposed them
3745319 in montgomery county 62 percent supported them in scottsdale 63 percent said they were in favor after the operation began 77 percent of drivers supported their use drivers support programs that make the road safer
3745320 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3745321 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3745322 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3745323 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3745324 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3745325 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3745326 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3745327 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3745331 i just keep saying to myself greatest olympian of all time over and over
3745332 it hasnt sunk in yet but its a great thing to hear people say it
3745333 hes just a normal person although maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3745334 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3745335 im just trying to get through everything its a lot of racing and its not easy
3745336 i am trying to take one race at a time
3745337 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
3745338 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3745339 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3745340 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3745341 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3745342 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3745343 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3745344 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3745345 only marginally favorable for development and the potential for tropical cyclone formation during the next day or two has decreased
3745346 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire
3745347 you have to be clearheaded about that kind of regime
3745348 mccains been much more clear sighted than the bush administration or many of our allies in europe
3745349 this is a guy who grew up in the cold war was a military person and an honorable man but has not changed his ways of thinking about russia
3745350 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
3745351 speaking directly to the russians as opposed to in some pugnacious cold war fashion is what this modern challenge needs
3745352 what russia needs to know is that it will be globally ostracized and barack obamas global approach is different from the state to state balance of power approach that is visible in the mccain talking points
3745353 he was a reaganite in the cold war that was a pro democracy anti communist approach
3745354 he was certainly supportive of yeltsin from the early 90s through the mid 90s
3745355 we should make clear to russia that we appreciate the importance of russian stability to our own security
3745356 but we should make equally clear to russia that we are free to pursue all opportunities for enhancing our security and that of our allies
3745357 w e must make abundantly clear to moscow that we consider this action to be evidence that russia cannot yet be trusted as good faith partners in preserving european stability
3745358 i suspect that john mccain was made privy to sensitive or classified info that we may have on putin his kgb past things hes done
3745359 when putin emerged as this highly capable strongman with kgb networks i suspect that turned mccain off
3745360 a country that increasingly appears to have more in common with its soviet and czarist predecessors than with the modern state vladimir putin claims to aspire to build
3745361 moscow must understand that it cannot enjoy a genuine partnership with the west so long as its actions at home and abroad conflict so fundamentally with the core values of the euro atlantic democracies
3745362 mccain was there a decade earlier than bush and with greater consistency

3745366 the big trend here this summer go figure is merchandise printed with the distinctive leaf of the marijuana plant
3745367 because their primary purpose is supposed to be social welfare and there can be some overlap between that and political activities a clear definition would be needed if further disclosures were to be triggered at the state level
3745368 to the extent people really are electioneering and using the nonprofit status as a way to avoid disclosures i think we need to address that assuming we can find a clean constitutional way to do it
3745369 clearly folks are accruing a great deal of money and they want to keep that source of the money secret
3745370 its the last great refuge for donors who want to give unlimited contributions and maintain their anonymity while doing so

3745373 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3745381 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3745382 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3745383 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3745384 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3745387 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3745388 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3745389 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3745390 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3745391 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3745392 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3745393 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3745394 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3745395 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3745396 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3745415 regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past three years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities
3745416 exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3745417 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3745418 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3745419 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3745420 instead of dreaming up ideas in london david camerons ignorant chums at policy exchange should let me show them round leeds the city with the fastest growing economy in the country

3745424 we found that in 2005 fully one third of chinas greenhouse gas emissions were due to production of exports
3745425 this proportion has risen quickly from 12 per cent in 1987 and only 21 per cent in 2002
3745426 it is clear that urgent improvements are needed especially in chinas electricity sector
3745427 installing more renewable power and overcoming the financial and technological hurdles involved with new technologies such as carbon sequestration should be the first priority of both china and its export partners

3745443 the most important priority for mg alba is that viewers and listeners receive high quality television radio and online services and im delighted that we are establishing this new service through the historic collaboration between mg alba and the bbc
3745444 bbc alba will offer a new and enhanced service to the gaelic audience and will also reach out to the wider scottish audience by offering a range of attractive and compelling programmes

3745457 text messaging has become embedded into the fabric of our culture in recent years
3745458 we believe there is a need to offer consumers a way to retain the ability to send messages without the risk of injury during the process its easier and potentially much less painful to speak messages rather than always typing them

3745485 anti national elements threw a bomb at shiva temple and later set it on fire at handwara the fire gutted the entire temple complex bombs were lobbed at temples in srinagar also which created a scare amongst the hindus it was a calculated device to dissuade them from going to temples and adhering to their way of life

3745490 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3745491 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3745492 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3745493 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3745494 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3745495 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3745496 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3745497 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3745498 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3745499 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3745500 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3745501 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3745502 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3745503 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3745510 the number 1 thing parents can do to help their kids succeed in school on the first day and every day is to demonstrate that school is important in what they say and what they do
3745511 back to school can be stressful for everyone with new schedules new schools new supplies and clothes to buy but its our jobs as parents to ease the transition from the lazy days of summer to the more regimented school year schedule
3745512 and the place to start is by paying attention following through and keeping a positive attitude to get you and your child off on the right foot this year

3745539 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them
3745540 generally speaking brands benefit from unprompted advocacy but every once in awhile there will be surprises its very difficult to manage

3745558 la lecci n del conflicto ruso georgiano es que las personas que reclaman el ingreso de pa ses a la otan deben comprender que si no se est dispuesto a apoyarlos con verdaderas medidas de seguridad se les puede causar da os
3745559 creo que entre otras cosas se trata de un choque para esas personas que piensan que se puede hablar de ampliar la otan sin contemplar las posibles consecuencias
3745560 con el sentimiento de que la alianza le hab a jugado una mala pasada
3745561 sin duda alguna los rusos se quedaron con la impresi n de que deb an mostrarle a occidente cu n rid cula era desde su propio punto de vista comprometerse a proteger las fronteras de georgia
3745562 tuvimos que hacerlo porque no hab a manera de ir all y enfrentarnos a los rusos
3745563 conservar buenas relaciones con los rusos a largo plazo es muy importante para nosotros como lo es que comprendan que para ello no pueden agarr rsela con sus peque os vecinos

3745566 the ground has been destroyed their ancestors are there their bones are there the grounds are very important to the praying indians
3745567 it is not uncommon to find graves here when the town worked on rte 16 eliot street we unknowingly disturbed some graves
3745568 for them to find significant historic artifacts would not be unusual
3745569 in south natick historically it is well known that there were many indians in the area and christianity was brought to the indians in that area
3745570 we personally have engaged archaeologists we have done over 50 test holes on the site and we found nothing we are trying to be extremely sensitive to the historic nature of all of natick
3745571 in terms of the conservation commission i think there was a misunderstanding of the degree of the cutting going on
3745572 once i got a call and went to the property i realized i was not correct in my understanding of the work and saw that a land disturbance permit was required
3745573 i spoke with six or seven departments in the town and none of them made me aware of this requirement
3745574 apparently it is more typical to get this permit along with a building permit the building permit is further down the road we are still working on different layouts for the project
3745575 before we were stopped i had neighbors who came over and expressed pleasure that something was going to happen on the spot and that the historic building would not be left to fall apart
3745576 i am writing a letter to the town saying we have two more years on lease and you talked to us about a three year short term lease
3745577 we would be very interested in a short term lease and a long term lease but its our understanding that may not happen the town may sell it so from our perspective we may not have a home

3745579 sin crawling out of the ditch of poverty and shame has but few temptations poets and painters have portrayed satan as a hideouscreature with horns and hoofs if i were a poet i would describe him with manners polished to the last perfection hair flowing in graceful ringlets eye glistening with splendor hands soft and diamonded step light and graceful voice mellow as a flute conversation articulate and eloquent breath perfumed until it would seem that nothing had ever touched his lips but balm and myrrh but his heart i would encase with the scales of a monster then filled with pride with beastliness of lust with recklessness with hypocrisy with death with damnation in my next portrait i would unmask the devil until his two eyes would become the cold orbs of the adder and on his lip would come the foam of raging intoxication and to his feet the spring of the panther and his soft hand would become the clammy hand of a wasted skeleton and in the smooth lisp of his tongue would come the hiss of the worm which never dies while suddenly from his heart would burst in all devouring fury the unquenchable flames of hell but until unmasked i would describe him as nothing but myrrh and balm and ringlet and diamond and flute like voice with pleasant and mirthful conversation

3745590 i was trying to see the t on the bottom of the pool to try and judge my turn and the finish i was more or less just sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take in a 50 and i was hoping i was going to be dead on and i was going to be able to hit the wall perfectly i was able to get my hand on the wall first and it was a best time but i think i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that

3745690 heart failure patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy in clinical practice are sicker and differ significantly from those enrolled in randomized controlled trials
3745691 further research is needed to understand the reasons for the variations in cardiac resynchronization therapy use at the patient physician and hospital levels and to implement programs to improve the awareness and promotion of evidence based use of medical devices in heart failure
3745692 given the cost of these devices and the significant benefit associated with cardiac resynchronization therapy there is a great need to define which patients are and are not receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy in clinical practice
3745693 nonguideline based new cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation was spread widely among hospitals with up to one third of our hospitals implanting at least one patient with lvef gt 35

3745701 almost exactly four years after that campaign against sen john kerry began mr corsi has released a new attack book painting senator barack obama the democrats presumed presidential nominee as a stealth radical liberal who has tried to cover up extensive connections to islam mr obama is christian and questioning whether his admitted experimentation with drugs in high school and college ever ceased
3745702 significant parts of the book whose subtitle is leftist politics and the cult of personality have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since its debut on aug 1 nonetheless it is to make its first appearance on the new york times best seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this sunday at no 1
3745703 mr obamas campaign has yet to weigh in heavily on mr corsis accusations it appears to face the classic decision between the risk of publicizing the books claims by addressing them and the risk of letting them sink into the public debate with no response

3745705 clintons campaign never did quite become the flag waving patriotic operation that penn envisioned in march 2007 nor did she ever go as overtly negative as he was preaching in march and april 2008 would she be the nominee if she had and can mccain win the presidency if he carefully pursues a similar path
3745706 mccain risks damaging his reputation as a politician who has eschewed the politics of negativity
3745707 but what was considered out of bounds in a democratic primary campaign may be less so in a general election race in which other voters come into play mccain will have to make some difficult judgments about this in the final 82 days

3745709 the focus on warner could help boost his prospects in virginia where he is trying to win an open senate seat and obama is also campaigning hard

3745783 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia

3745787 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3745788 i have a crazy number i feel i want him to get i want him to be the number one back in the nfl i want him to get that number
3745789 i always have a number now ill never share that number but ill always have one i try to work hard towards it the key to getting those numbers is having a fast start
3745790 hes been there hes been to the top i know hes in great shape and were gonna try to get him as many as we can
3745791 we dont always put it on the board but i have a number in mind the number i would say we definitely want to get is one number one in rushing
3745792 when were out there playing we dont think about it we dont talk about it never
3745793 we want to be the best backfield on that field so we set a number but were not talking about it during the game the win comes first and then the individual efforts come after that
3745794 last year before season started a lot of people thought he had a half tank
3745795 we want him to get the ball with a back like that when he gets his touches we get a chance to control the clock and win the game
3745796 you kind of know how its going to be by then you feel it the o line is blocking the track is good everythings popping its a groove
3745797 its almost like michael jordan being in a zone hes shooting shooting shooting and he cant be stopped you try to find that feeling every game but its not always there
3745798 but were all hungry we didnt get in the playoffs last year that was a bitter taste we have to get there
3745799 with this kind of offense the key to getting those numbers is having the defense step up and play hard
3745800 the defense gets you the ball back get us that ball back once i warm up because ill wear that defense down keep em on the field keep em tired make hay
3745801 he had 1 300 last year i know hes always trying to get as many as he can i think if he stays healthy he could put up some big numbers

3745812 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3745813 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3745814 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3745815 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3745816 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts

3745822 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3745823 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way

3745850 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3745851 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3745852 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3745853 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3745854 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3745855 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3745856 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers

3745868 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

3745885 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3745886 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3745887 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3745888 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3745889 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3745890 we know a lot of publishers are doing nothing with their international eyeballs or are using one ad network
3745891 our proposition is based around the better monetisation of 1000 ads currently for many publishers that can be less than 1 0 52 we promise face to face to improve that maybe by 10 times 20 times or even 50 times
3745892 we are there to help the transition from print to digital
3745893 publishers cant just expect digital to be the white knight that will come along and save them and some of the publishers we are speaking to do expect that publishers need to understand digital better they need to understand what digital advertisers need and invest heavily in their digital output they are well on the road but by their own admission they are by no means there
3745894 theres a great pc world down the road to help when the blackberry breaks and what else would i need
3745895 finding and adding the value no matter what side of the negotiating table he is on
3745896 well what am i going to do trust some 22 year old yahoo sales rep who will dump adverts in indiscriminately or a man like chris who is going to rock up and represent the telegraph a brand that oozes trust and respectability
3745897 this is new and there will be bumps i dont expect it to be all puppy dogs and ice cream but with chris i can have a grown up value based discussion
3745898 corning incorporated and dupont demonstrate an enterprise wide commitment to innovation and are highly successful in the continuous development of profitable new products and businesses

3745900 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage
3745901 they did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3745902 they looked very happy the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3745903 mans withdrawl from god unto his own death like the freedom of human will is outside of gods jurisdiction and it is outside of his jurisdiction by his own will god saves only through love and freedom this point is exactly what theologians under the influence of augustine have never comprehended thinking that the divine essence energy and will are identical they were not in a positition to even suspect that free beings outside of god are capable of acting against the divine will as a result it is impossible for them to seriously accept that death exists in the world as a kind of parasite apart from the will of god and that the divine will and the salvific divine energy are not one and the same thing god does not will death nevertheless he does not act to destroy it until he has prepared men to accept life
3745904 providence is gods will we ought to wonder at and accept the works of providence even if they appear to many to be unjust because gods providence is unknowable and incomprehensible and because our thoughts and acts and what is to come are known only to him i speak of course about the things which are not up to us for what is up to us does not belong to the providence but to our own self determination

3745925 o mahmoud o mahmoud you rest and we will continue the struggle
3745926 he was the master of the word and wisdom the symbol who expressed our national feeling our human constitution our declaration of independence
3745927 somehow we felt that as long as there is mahmoud darwish there is a sense of goodness a sense of hope a sense of possibility for salvation
3745928 these crowds reflect the deep loss that palestinians and arabs have suffered
3745929 darwish has managed to break many of the taboos between the occupier and the people who resist the occupation
3745930 darwish was palestine personified in a man full of love nationalism and passion

3745937 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3745938 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3745939 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3745940 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3745941 contrary to rumours circulating nick mccabe cut his finger on piece of glass in the dressing room after the gig in japan
3745942 he was treated by medics at the scene and then flew home hes fine except for a sore finger and that wont effect their appearance at v at the weekend

3745944 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3745945 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3745946 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3745947 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws
3745948 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3745949 the democratic leadership has got to listen to the people on this issue
3745950 theres a lot of folks in our country who think we should be doing something about the high price of gasoline but were not
3745951 ive got friends here who have just been lifelong friends people who have seen me through thick and thin in tough times and in good times
3745952 there are a lot of people who have done everything right and yet are still coming up short
3745953 and over time their faith in the american dream starts slipping away
3745954 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations
3745955 it is not an indictment of your educational quality because it is such a different sample of students from what weve seen before
3745956 instead of testing just the college bound you are testing a lot of students who didnt plan to attend college
3745957 a lot of variation in high school in terms of how well kids are being prepared for college
3745958 as we expand the pool for more students we are bringing in more students for whom high school is not preparing them as well for post secondary education
3745959 you travel with a certain amount of pre match optimism this is dangerous although you are on the road away from your usual environs you must try to keep a grip on reality just because you are making the effort doesnt mean the players are going to

3745961 to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
3745962 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3745963 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3745964 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3745965 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3745966 come upstairs i want to taste you just for a few minutes
3745967 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3745968 is it just me or do you wonder where these people are looking when they claim that they cant find any black models
3745969 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving obama campaign manager david plouffe wrote in a statement early this morning
3745970 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3745971 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3745972 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3745973 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3745974 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
3745975 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3745976 at the markets we have been buying food it has become just too expensive
3745977 a lot of markets just dont have any food to buy
3745978 as a result we are not able to buy food in ethiopia anymore
3745979 at a local level food prices are increasing and that of course impacts on our programs making them more expensive
3745980 it means that we have to increase the amount of money we are asking from our donors
3745981 food aid alone does not get at the fundamental problems that weak and impoverished states are facing
3745982 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3745983 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3745984 the fcc is appalled by this treatment of an accredited journalists within half a mile of the main olympic stadium
3745985 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3745986 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
3745987 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3745988 watch your heart with all diligence for from it flow the springs of life
3745989 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3745990 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3745991 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3745992 she was a very intelligent dog to live for that long
3745993 she was jumping on me and excited to get out of there
3745994 he went running toward her trying to feed her treats
3745995 permanent joy for all of the little demonstrates that collectivist societies can prosper
3745996 i never had to i could win more for the men through argument and negotiation
3745997 chinas leaders know that the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development
3745998 china given its current economic growth and prosperity can be a leader in deploying and using advanced energy and environmental technology
3745999 i usually ask people what their top three challenges are and then listen at some point you can feed back their challenges and may be angle a solution that fits with their concerns

3746064 democrats ready to unload on mccain reed over atlanta fund raiser
3746065 calling yourself a maverick and claiming credit for fighting corruption while raising money with one of the central figures in the jack abramoff corruption scandal is not what most voters have in mind when they think of straight talk
3746066 it is however one more example of why john mccain is offering more of the same failed republican leadership
3746067 despite his shady ties to abramoff mccain never called reed to testify before his committee in fact despite acknowledging wrongdoing among his colleagues mccain refused to investigate fellow republicans in congress
3746068 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is is willing to go to win despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept tainted money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics a maverick no more the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3746069 im strongly supporting senator mccain because hes advocating conservative positions on taxes judges energy strengthening the family and common sense values i have great respect for his service to the country
3746070 i sent that e mail out in my capacity as a private citizen i dont hold any position or title with the mccain campaign havent sought one dont want one
3746071 precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3746072 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large
3746073 it is a lot of racing and its not easy the next ones are pretty important
3746074 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3746075 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3746076 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3746077 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3746078 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3746079 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3746080 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3746081 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3746082 this is august 7 this is my birthday and im taking a bath in the sink at burger king

3746148 the current conflict between russia and georgia over the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia has been widely viewed as a throwback to the cold war era with georgia seeking to reassert control over areas it considers part of its sovereign territory and russia aiming to punish a regime it deems overly friendly to the west
3746149 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it russia seeks to frustrate americas use of georgia for this purpose and uses abkhazia and south ossetia as daggers pointed at the jugular of the btc pipeline when saakashvili sought to drive the russians out of these enclaves the russians struck back
3746150 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3746151 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3746152 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3746153 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3746154 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3746155 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially

3746184 no one will say it out loud but the lack of uptake in honours maths in ireland is due to teacher performance
3746185 the teaching of maths is the single most important factor in a childs education and the fact of the matter is the education system cannot surpass beyond the quality of its teachers
3746186 talk of the maths failure rate being an international problem is a cop out
3746187 we have the potential to improve the interest in maths science and engineering but were not creative enough to take the right steps
3746188 this is a real economic issue for ireland in terms of companies that rely on students coming out of engineering and computer courses we are asleep when it comes to maths and we are just hitting the snooze button when maths points are brought up were just not getting out of bed on the issue and this could be disastrous for the economy
3746189 maths is the language of the knowledge economy we have to address teacher performance a whole series of steps are needed but it requires bravery at the department of education and science
3746190 some of these people only have to do a module as part of one year at teacher training college to be qualified to teach honours maths we have to acknowledge the fact that honours maths requires special treatment
3746191 all technology companies are finding it hard to get irish talent smes are finding it hard and they are competing against organisations like google intel and ibm if an organisation has 20 polish it engineers in a high cost location like dublin surely someone in head office is going to be asking why dont they have an office in a lower cost location like poland this is potentially a very serious issue for the economy and no one seems brave enough to take the steps that need taking
3746192 there is still resistance from young people to engineering and science training in schools and colleges and there continues to be an ongoing shying away from these so called hard subjects
3746193 it is the governments responsibility to foster the countrys economic interests and a key element of this is an education system that equips students to face the modern world and solve the challenges of today and the future
3746194 maths has been a cause for concern for some time and obviously the 12pc failure rate is disappointing the government is aware reform is needed at second level as there is not adequate understanding of mathematical concepts
3746195 we aim to ensure this changes by introducing project maths in 24 schools this september which is a new concept to bring about a cultural change in the teaching of maths

3746300 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3746301 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3746302 it continues to work with american shipping company regarding the timing of the exercise of the option
3746303 it felt great to get that first one off my chest
3746304 finally i mean it took forever i was just worrying about squaring it up making solid contact and hopefully it would fall somewhere and it did
3746305 he threw it the first pitch before the home run and i almost got it i cut it back to the dugout so i thought he was going to come with it again and he did and i reacted when i saw it
3746306 our coach always tells us think where the ball is gonna hit try to visualize the way its gonna hit before the play happens kind of preparation pre play preparation i did that and when the ball was hit i reacted
3746307 the pitching every day is consistent at least 88 95 mph every single day
3746308 in high school i probably topped out at 84 85 what i saw that wasnt even every day the best in my region was probably 85 summer ball i mean it wasnt like this they threw hard but they wasnt spotting up pitches like they do now they didnt have the same off speed as pitchers do now so thats why i gotta make adjustments every day
3746309 when i field the ball i slow everything down once i fielded the ball in high school i was getting it and getting it out i have learned how to make adjustments to the runner to the team just slowing everything down and letting the game come to me
3746310 i dont think they expect a lot out of me right now so i dont put pressure on myself i just go about my business the same way listen to my coaches go 110 percent at practice every day and get better every day
3746311 it was great because he had his experience with four years of college so everything he told me i listened to him
3746312 he has more experience than me hes been to college while he was here he helped me stay humble he helped me work hard every day reminded me to work hard every day reminded me what im here for i mean its why we got drafted love of the game
3746313 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression
3746314 the certification by the nglcc has helped us prove ourselves on a larger scale

3746331 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with
3746332 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3746333 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3746334 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3746335 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3746336 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3746337 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3746338 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3746339 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3746340 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3746341 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3746342 i see zubed as a key tool in enabling both our sales people and the business in achieving their maximum potential
3746343 zubed is already changing the way we view our business and is starting to change behaviours and results it will become a critical solution to maximising the return on our investments in sales retention people and our customers for the first time we will be able to target and approach retailers in specific segments with the right products and services to meet their developing needs
3746344 for too long sales teams and individuals have had to battle with irrelevant search results and inaccurate business categorisation
3746345 zubedsales means an end to this allowing sales people to spend more time meeting with real prospects and securing greater value customers after just a few minutes spent in our intuitive map based search environment
3746346 i dont think theres anyone else even if we did open it up that we would want in the position
3746347 weve taken a lot of these unused or expired medications off the streets making it a safer community
3746348 there is a great need in our community for a safe method of disposing unwanted and or unused drugs
3746349 baseball is americas pastime and major league baseball is a friend of st lucie county
3746350 were pleased to receive these funds for continued investments in our community and were looking forward to the first pitch from the new mounds very soon
3746351 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3746352 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3746353 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3746354 on the verge of exploding in the next two years

3746359 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3746360 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3746361 those new fans and old alike will return to the original film to enjoy and participate with the exceptional and timeless performances of tim curry richard obrien susan sarandon and the entire cast
3746362 so here we go again with a new cast believing that the sky and mtv remake will add to the rocky horror phenomenon
3746363 but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
3746364 i dont have to be dressed up like when i was with destinys child although those were some of my best style days

3746371 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3746372 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3746373 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3746374 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3746375 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3746376 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress
3746377 it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3746378 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3746379 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3746380 there are no signs of any prolonged spell of settled weather just yet
3746381 north and west areas of the country are likely to see more showers over the next few days and there will be one or two in the south as well
3746382 in previous augusts last year excepted we have got used to quite nice weather at this time of the month but its not looking that way this year
3746383 we are not contemplating his departure robi will continue with us
3746384 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3746385 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3746386 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3746387 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3746388 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3746389 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3746390 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3746391 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3746392 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3746393 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3746394 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3746395 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3746396 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3746397 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3746398 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3746400 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

3746403 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
3746404 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
3746405 we found a number of characteristics of health care access that are particular to latinos
3746406 among people who have health insurance 19 percent lacked a usual health care provider compared to 42 percent of people who lack health insurance
3746407 this suggests that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from doctors
3746408 among those people who reported they were not satisfied with their health care the most common reason why they received poor health care was financial
3746409 they felt that their health care professional did not provide good care because they did not have the means to pay for the health care
3746410 about a third of hispanics get their medical information from doctors

3746422 it is very nice to win this prize and a big help for my career
3746423 more importantly this was a very interesting competition because it celebrates this kind of interdisciplinary approach and gave us junior scholars an opportunity to interact with and get feedback from established professionals
3746424 to be chosen from such a talented group of entrants is great and it was good to have a chance to get some top feedback on my work
3746425 interdisciplinary studies of the mind are becoming more and more important
3746426 encouraging young scholars like this who are truly empirically informed interdisciplinary and excited about the mind bringing them together and showing them that they can do things like this i think is incredibly important
3746427 the european science foundation is doing a very good job of supporting that it is just an exciting time to be studying the mind and a therefore a great time to get young scholars interested
3746428 one thing that we have seen here is just how much serious first author work is being done by people whose names you probably wont see in published journals for a few years yet but who are certainly going to be at the forefront of the next generation

3746446 gdp is now falling at an annual rate of 1 4 but perhaps more significantly two successive quarters of negative growth mean that estonia has now entered a technical recession
3746447 the latvian economy grew by just 0 2 y y in q2 this appears consistent with a contraction in seasonally adjusted gdp of 1 5 q q the first quarterly fall since 1998 but it s only a matter of time before latvia joins estonia in recession
3746448 what s more there are three good reasons to think that things will get worse before they get better
3746449 firstly labour markets have yet to react to the slowdown in the first half of 2008 the unemployment rate has actually fallen in latvia and lithuania and has remained flat in estonia but surveys point to a rise in unemployment over the coming months
3746450 secondly the growth outlook for the euro zone has deteriorated in recent months since exports to the euro zone account for roughly 15 of gdp in the baltics this could hit manufacturers in the region hard it is becoming even more difficult for the region to rebalance towards net exports
3746451 finally external financing conditions are likely to become more difficult over the coming year as global liquidity dries up this will make it much harder for the region to fund its huge current account deficits as a result these deficits will have to shrink and this requires a further contraction in domestic demand
3746452 the upshot is that we expect the region to enter a deep and protracted recession
3746453 obviously the numbers are bad as they confirm that the slowdown in the estonian economy is continuing furthermore the speed of adjustment is significantly higher than was expected just half a year ago the estonian economy is clearly sliding into recession and the economy will slow further rather than rebound
3746454 in sum we expect negative growth for 2008 as a whole of around 1 meanwhile all indicators suggest that a pronounced slowdown is also under way in the other two baltic economies
3746455 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3746456 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3746457 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid
3746458 we believe the way to sell more newspapers is to invest in editorial content rather than employ a skeleton staff and we will fight these cuts

3746502 the victims were not going to lie down and go away some staged protests and even started up a victims justice group in cases such as this there is often great feeling and emotions can run very high when victims who have come forward to seek answers or redress for the abuse they suffered to have the door shut in the face by the authority responsible is a terrible thing and they say it is like being abused all over again
3746503 victims are often motivated by a sense of justice and wanting the truth to be heard which can make for uncomfortable listening at the other end they are brave to come forward and tell their stories of abuse bullying and neglect
3746504 city council deserves credit for listening to the victims and negotiating a settlement whilst it is impossible to put right the many wrongs suffered by the victims in their childhood it is the recognition that matters

3746545 die initiative platterwatch hat jetzt eine logische nachfolge gefunden denn auch nach dem r cktritt platters geht der ausbau des berwachungsstaats in sterreich ungehemmt weiter

3746554 the discovery that john mccains remarks on georgia were derived from wikipedia to put it politely is disturbing and even depressing but not surprising under the tutelage of the neoconservatives who revealed their superficial understanding of iraq both before and after the invasion he favors bellicose grandstanding over strategic thinking so why delve deeper than a quick google search

3746557 thats kind of damning but i think what really tips it off as being stolen from wikipedia is that its totally wrong everybody knows that georgia is a state in the southeastern united states and was one of the original thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution
3746558 three background sentences that is one of which closely tracks wikipedias entry on georgia two more of which contain some phrases in common plus a third passage thats being offered as evidence of plagiarism and just isnt

3746670 sono molto contento per il lavoro effettuato abbiamo fatto tutto secondo programma abbiamo disputato tante amichevoli ma quelle con il larissa ed il wolfsburg compagini di alto livell sono le pi rappresentative dove le vittorie ci hanno dato tantissimo morale credo che questa sia la squadra giusta dal punto di vista tattico e mentale e ovvio che ancora dobbiamo migliorare sotto certi aspetti anche io sto valutando alcune cose dobbiamo recuperare un paio di giocatori e con altri serve ancora un p di pazienza ma a conti fatti penso che la squadra abbia fatto una buona preparazione
3746671 es una campa a para ayudar a los ni os del hospital garrahan entramos en internet en una oportunidad y vimos que la fundaci n garrahan recibe las tapitas y las vende como materia prima a una f brica la recolecci n no tiene l mites es una cosa que permanentemente se puede hacer en realidad es una hermosa actividad porque con tan poco esfuerzo uno recoge basura recicla y hace una obra de bien de acuerdo a la informaci n de internet 600 tapitas equivale a una di lisis y 5 000 a una quimioterapia
3746672 la idea es juntar en la capilla de f tima en la bajada vieja porque lo que podemos juntar en cada casa es poco pero con un poco en cada lado se puede hacer mucho ahora ya juntamos 10 000 tapitas y empezamos a mandar esta semana las tapitas tienen que ser las de cualquier gaseosa y de agua mineral nosotros tenemos una urna en la capilla de f tima y entre toda la comunidad afrontaremos los gastos del traslado del flete
3746673 la fundaci n garrahan tambi n tienen un programa de reciclado de papel pero nosotros desistimos de ese programa porque el papel pesa mucho y los gastos saldr an m s caros y no lo bamos a poder enfrentar
3746674 y ese mucho es una obra de saneamiento al ambiente de limpieza de la ciudad y una obra de caridad caminando por la costanera recojo 30 tapitas en una hora alguna ventaja ten amos que sacar de la mala costumbre de tirar la basura
3746675 la verdad que no se nos ocurri porque nos esta superando la cantidad de gente que colabora el colegio san basilio tambi n se sumo y as distintos lugares y no damos abasto a recoger las tapitas una de las profesoras de ese colegio teresita con sus alumnos ya recogieron 1 000 tapitas

3746681 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi
3746682 it was unfortunate and biggest injustice done by this government in the name of gandhi it was also a direct attack on gandhian principles

3746707 it took vmware up until 1 p m on tuesday aug 12 to post an official statement on the issue and they still have not reached out to their customers
3746708 they said they expect to have the issue resolved within 36 hours that is unacceptable to users
3746709 we had to quickly change the date to aug 10 get the vms running again and work as fast as we could to change the time to aug 12 again once the vms are running it works fine its when we shut down that is the issue

3746720 voor vervoer van ons personeel naar het werk gebruiken we bussen
3746721 we hadden ook verwacht dat taxis moeilijk te vinden zouden zijn maar peking heeft meer taxis ingezet dus dat is geen probleem en onze bussen komen eerder aan tijdens de olympische periode kunnen onze mensen zelfs later naar hun werk vertrekken omdat er minder verkeer is
3746722 we hebben extra werk gestoken in voorzorgsmaatregelen maar uiteindelijk hebben we er zakelijk gezien geen last van en persoonlijk genieten we van de olympische spelen

3746757 este material es un cambio total desde la imagen hasta la m sica en cada disco que he entregado me gusta reinventarme peor con este lo hice al 100 por ciento contiene 12 canciones in ditas hay una que se llama la vida me cambi que me compuso reyli y mario domm est otra que es ya lo ves la cual me hizo carlos mac as y tambi n compuse sola junto a los chicos de angels otra de las rolas del cd es una propuesta totalmente pop con una evoluci n que viene desde mi interior

3746759 eso es algo que me sigue emocionando much simo me puse chinita de la piel ese d a fueron cerca de 500 personas a la firma de aut grafos y al final me sorprendieron con una serenata reviv momentos de cuando estuve en un concierto en el auditorio coca cola es muy padre saber que en tu tierra la gente te sigue apoyando ah y no s lo hab a regios tambi n acudieron fans de saltillo guadalajara chihuahua y tamaulipas eso siempre se quedar en mi mente y en mi coraz n
3746760 el personaje que me ofrecieron se llama belinda agradezco que me hayan tomado en cuenta pero en este momento tengo mucho trabajo con lo del disco y el show pero espero que despu s si me dan chance me pueda integrar
3746761 me llamaron para realizar los promoci nales pero ya ten a todo mi plan de promoci n del lbum armado y no pude ir espero que me llamen de nuevo para otra cosa
3746762 han pasado seis a os han sido pocos pero muy intensos y los he vivido muy bien han pasado muchas cosas que me han hecho crecer como cantante y como mujer me ha tocado estar en varios escenarios que me van dejando experiencias tambi n cada disco es un aprendizaje y todo esto en conjunto te va haciendo madurar en todos los aspectos
3746763 no tengo nada de que arrepentirme en mi vida personal y profesional soy una persona que siempre piensa mucho en lo que hace y en lo que dice porque precisamente no me gusta arrepentirme de nada trato de dar lo mejor de mi arriba y abajo del escenario me siento satisfecha con lo que he logrado y con lo que he ganado sin embargo eso no significa que caiga en la mediocridad porque seguir luchando por todo lo que me falta por hacer

3746765 heres what you can do so no one gets pregnant but you can still get some sexual kicks
3746766 damn that is pretty cool i wish wed thought of that first
3746767 its a fantastic win we got stronger as the game went on
3746768 its nice to get through to the next round and hopefully we can get a big club and get some coffers in
3746769 still at our staff meeting this morning i drew up our starting offensive line and i drew up everybody when theyre healthy and its a pretty good looking football team
3746770 i cant wait to see what my teams going to do
3746771 i really feel like hes just been bringing it out of us and i feel like were in the perfect position to shock a lot of people
3746772 you can say its the coaching staff or whatever it is but whatever happened its just a big change around here
3746773 everybody mainly has a different feeling excited about going to practice excited about working out just the small things that are bringing the team together
3746774 its living it every day monday through friday and not just saturday its not something thats just going to happen when the lights come on youve got to work at it they really gave it to us this spring but we saw the inconsistency boy thats something youve really got to improve on
3746775 he just hasnt played for a while under the lights under the pressure im anxious to see that
3746776 theyre a great group of guys i cant say anything bad about any of them not one of them
3746777 weve got a lot of speed weve got a lot of quickness weve got a couple of guys who are big and theyre willing to go up and get the ball and work hard to do whatever it takes to succeed
3746778 id describe it as aggressive attacking blitzing just some of everything
3746779 i think we have improved since sundays scrimmage we are correcting our mistakes and moving forward
3746780 our running backs can catch the ball all of them and they adjust well to the ball
3746781 i think thats as big as the hands being able to open your hips adjust to the ball when its behind you adjust when its high and keep your balance they can all do that and were going to need to utilize them in the passing game
3746782 hes shown a lot of improvement in the passing game ive been really happy with the way hes been catching the ball in traffic his speed on his routes has really improved he now has to make those same strides in the running game and be a reliable blocker when we run the ball and a protector when we throw the ball
3746783 in this area we do see a high rate of violence against our agents in fact last year we had about 245 in the fiscal year and we are already up to 330 this year

3746794 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3746795 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3746796 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3746797 our members are facing the reality of a 5 per cent inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
3746798 last month the mayor said that he would see to it that all cleaners on metronet contracts would be paid the london living wage by august at the latest but there is still no sign even of that happening
3746799 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3746800 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
3746801 despite rmt claims that the deal is not equal to that set at metronet tube lines believes its pay and conditions are very competitive and amongst the best in the rail industry
3746802 for example employees get 29 days of annual leave as well as eight bank holidays and employees in operational grades receive an 80 per cent subsidy on travel

3746824 minnesota solid waste rules prohibit the disposal of solid waste into waters of the state of minnesota including lake superior

3746826 this coal did not dissolve or dissipate in the waters of the lake but instead floated and accumulated along the beach in duluth
3746827 we think a reasonable approach is to sweep the spill dry during loading and unloading most of the spills occur then
3746828 given the sheer volume of cargo that has been dumped over this time frame and the likelihood that such sweepings would be concentrated in ports and shipping lanes it is presumptuous to state that bottomlands in these areas suffer only minor indirect adverse effects without conclusive evidence to demonstrate such a statement

3746838 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3746839 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3746840 det v rste ved den tid vi lever i i jeblikket er nok den stigende racisme
3746841 danmarks radios b amp u afdeling var hverken indoktrinerende eller venstreorienteret i sin startfase fra 1968 til 1972 det konkluderer helle strandgaard jensen i et nyt speciale fra ruc
3746842 jeg har p intet tidspunkt oplevet den form for indoktrinering som mange forbinder med udsendelserne
3746843 jeg har set eksempler p at man pr vede at opfordre b rn til at st fast p deres ret fort lle dem at de har rettigheder og at deres meninger ogs t ller men det kan man n ppe kalde for venstreorienteret
3746844 n r man kan forbinde b amp u med det venstreorienterede er det fordi udsendelserne er antiautorit re og kritiske det at tage afstand fra autoriteter var dengang noget venstreorienteret men sp rgsm let er om man kan kalde det at v re kritisk og selvreflekteret for venstreorienteret i dag hvad vil de h jreorienterede sige til det
3746845 b rneorienteret er i virkeligheden et bedre ord til at beskrive det
3746846 mange marxistiske p dagoger og venstreorienterede socialp dagoger i bupl kritiserede b amp u h rdt de mente at man leflede for laveste f llesn vner ved at have bamser med i udsendelserne og man kritiserede blandt andet kaj og andrea for ikke at have tissem nd og tissekoner og for generelt ikke at afspejle virkeligheden

3746915 i only started growing black eyed beans recently yet for what i sold of the crop i have already managed to buy two cows and send my children to school from the proceeds i am certainly not looking back
3746916 we received little rains but still managed a decent harvest the crop is drought resistant and one is assured of a harvest even during a season when there is a dry spell
3746917 this crop is very good because it gives us food and income
3746918 the young pods and the leafy shoots can be eaten as a fresh vegetable the seed can be ground to make powder for tea also you can grind macia sorghums groundnuts and black eyed beans and make bread that is so tasty it will make your tongue lick forever
3746919 i can get to feed the whole family and it gives a good yield better than other beans that we have traditionally grown most people including local farmers outside our program are interested in purchasing the seed
3746920 the leaves are also nutritious as vegetable relish one can cook them as greens or dry them up
3746921 my sister in law has been bedridden for a very long time every time she eats the beans that we have traditionally grown she suffers from diarrhea but ever since she started eating black eyed beans she is in a much better condition
3746922 i urge other farmers to grow black eyed beans because there are numerous benefits however it requires a farmer with a heart for it the crop is susceptible to disease and requires constant attention however the returns are worth it

3746960 in todays rapid fire political atmosphere of cable news talk radio and the internet media analysts can easily make the mistake of believing that the leading network news outlets were tough on a candidate because of the general perception of how the entire media old media and new media brought a controversy to the publics attention

3747043 someone must be in charge of the storehouses you have to find a man whos full of wisdom to oversee it all

3747058 on the cross of calvary mormons and the broken tree
3747059 rees said there are no good reasons why mormons could not make the cross more central to their religious experience and that rejecting the cross is illogical and unnecessary
3747060 rees said the fact that lds church members believe the most crucial elements of the atonement took place in the garden of gethsemane and not on the cross also tend to shift importance away from the cross
3747061 the sectarian world falsely suppose that the climax of his torture and suffering was on the cross a view they keep ever before them by the constant use of the cross as a religious symbol the fact is that intense and severe as the suffering was on the cross yet the great pains were endured in the garden of gethsemane
3747062 for lds people the acceptance of the atonement is not symbolized by the cross
3747063 for redeemed sinners every good thing indeed every bad thing that god turns for good was obtained for us by the cross of christ apart from the death of christ sinners get nothing but judgment apart from the cross of christ there is only condemnation therefore everything that you enjoy in christ as a christian as a person who trusts christ is owing to the death of christ and all your rejoicing in all things should therefore be a rejoicing in the cross where all your blessings were purchased for you at the cost of the death of the son of god jesus christ every blessing in life is designed to magnify the cross of christ or to say it another way every good thing in life is meant to magnify christ and him crucified
3747064 he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief we esteemed him stricken smitten by god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed
3747065 there are no good reasons why mormons could not make the cross more central to their religious experience and that rejecting the cross is illogical and unnecessary
3747066 the lives of our people must become the most meaningful expression of our faith and in fact therefore the symbol of our worship

3747068 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
3747069 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
3747070 after extensive monitoring estimated exposures to golfers following full applications of two turfgrass insecticides that are used throughout the northeastern united states were 19 to 68 times lower than levels set by the u s environmental protection agency designed to protect human health
3747071 because of the large amount of time people spend in turf environments exposure to pesticides from treated turf is a potentially significant exposure pathway
3747072 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3747073 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3747074 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3747075 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax

3747077 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan

3747080 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3747081 we have warned of the pa turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3747082 in other words a peace process that undermined palestinian democracy created a peace partner fatah so hated by its own people that the israeli army must now protect them
3747083 where is the money that was supposedly spent on reforming the judicial system where is the international outrage as palestinian leaders drag their own society further into the abyss
3747084 the appalling fact only fitfully reported in north america is that the two major palestinian factions are committed to an often murderous conflict
3747085 rather than a model for a future palestinian state gaza looks like somalia broken and ravenous

3747089 there are elite private schools i suppose that are eight times that cost im sure but in general theyre not as expensive as people think
3747090 in fact their cost is about half the cost of public schools but the public schools just want to be shielded from that kind of competition

3747099 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3747100 strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3747101 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3747102 sorely needed common ground to reduce the need for abortion
3747103 a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
3747104 by supporting mothers whose will and conscience tells them to carry their babies to term
3747105 broken through the narrow traditional barrier that only focused on a womens right to choose abortion

3747113 we came to the land to which you sent us it flows with milk and honey and this is its fruit 28 however the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large and besides we saw the descendants of anak there 29 the amalekites dwell in the land of the negeb the hittites the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the hill country and the canaanites dwell by the sea and along the jordan
3747114 let us go up at once and occupy it for we are well able to overcome it
3747115 we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we are
3747116 the land through which we have gone to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people that we saw in it are of great height 33 and there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who come from the nephilim and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers and so we seemed to them

3747119 some governors in the niger delta region have failed their people they are not using the money for the development of their area and the people those failed governors must not continue to be paid the 13 derivation fund by the federal government we should stop blaming the oil companies for our woes the governors should be blame because the oil companies are doing their best
3747120 i want to express the gratitude of our people the suffering people of the oil bearing communities of the niger delta for the suspension of the chairman of the nddc it is a welcome development and this has shown that the president is doing a very good job the president should go ahead to remove all the bad eggs from nddc it is only through this that the needed development will come to the region the federal government has good intentions for the region but those at the helm of affairs of the various agencies especially the nddc are not being sincere to their own people and this is why we welcome the suspension of the chairman of nddc
3747121 it is worth recalling that the hasty and careless position of the pdp in the immediate aftermath of the deadly attack on the governors convoy at ngwaiyiekwe on july 22 2008 was that the deputy governor comrade chris akomas was the target of the attackers and that the convoy was conveying n2 billion to port harcourt for the inducement of appeal court judges

3747134 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3747135 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3747136 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3747144 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3747145 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3747146 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3747147 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3747247 is to encourage wealthy persons from the north to invest in the oil and gas sector so as to protect the future of the region
3747248 it is worrisome that our people have been left behind in almost everything look at the banking sector where former president olusegun obasanjo forcefully conslidated the financial institutions in such a way that gave advantage to the south over the north we watch with pain such developments
3747249 out of the six oil companies operating in the country three namely ap conoil and oando are owned by the south west alone while the other three chevron shell and total are owned by multinatinoal corporations
3747250 now that chevron wants to divest its ownership of the oil giant the north is interested we want to secure our futture by buying this company so that we can have a sense of belonging in a federating economy but femi otedola the owner of ap is said to have interst in chevron also he is said to be making moves to buy the company and operate the two this is not fair we that dont have anything should buy it this time
3747251 obasanjo took over ap from former vice president atiku abubakar a northerner and gave it to his kinsman otedola at the peak of their conflict in 2006
3747252 the move to mobilise and take over chevron is receiving good responses from northn personalities
3747253 what we want is to invest in oil we have oil deposits but they have not been developed we are the largest transporters of oil from one part of the nation to the other we have the largest number of filling stations but have no ownership of what we transport we are calling on our people to come and invest there is much gain to reap it is our collective responsibility to reduce poverty eliminate begging and develop our people we have been left behind and we need to catch up
3747254 when i heard about it i was very happy that our people are waking up from slumber we need oil companies in the north

3747336 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
3747337 the new generation of 15 to 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
3747338 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal
3747339 wheres it going to go to thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket

3747360 telling the story rehearsing the mighty acts of god this is near the heart of christian worship a point not always fully appreciated in the enthusiastic free flowing worship common in many circles today we know god through what he has done in creation in israel and supremely in jesus and what he has done in his people and in the world through the holy spirit christian worship is praise of this god the one who has done these things

3747368 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
3747369 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
3747370 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
3747371 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure

3747375 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
3747376 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
3747377 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
3747378 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day

3747390 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
3747391 how come modern sports especially womens sports involve the exposure of private parts it is well known that the olympics both in the past and the upcoming games the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
3747392 one of these criminals compared a soccer team that made it to the top in asia and traveled to spain to the conquest of andalusia
3747393 many people nowadays watch sports rather than participate in them
3747394 if only they would run or move their bodies a little
3747395 wrestling involves the exposure of womens private parts even the promotion of the competitions is done by scantily clad women this is done at the beginning of the match in the middle and at the end or so i hear the matches are promoted by half naked women
3747396 the sport of yoga was originally a hindu game used for divine worship for them practicing yoga is a means of divine worship whoever practices yoga today is emulating their form of worship
3747397 beijing or not i call it bikini anyway because they are likely to display women in the worst possible way in these bikini olympic games
3747398 what women wear in the olympic games are among the worst clothes possible the inventions of satan with regard to the exposure of the body in gymnastics in swimming in whatever in tennis women have never gotten naked for sports like they do in the olympics it is aired to billions of people worldwide the problem is not just with the spectators who are present the whole thing is aired on tv
3747399 and maybe the mens clothing is more modest than the womens

3747411 the first and most important criterion is that we think the impact area will be productive from an ejecta standpoint
3747412 if we dont get ejecta into sunlight it wouldnt matter if we hit an iceberg because we would never know it
3747413 weve gone through essentially every possible launch date and picked a crater for each date

3747428 on monday most of the worlds media were reporting that russian troops were flooding out of south ossetia and into georgia proper they claimed that the cities of gori and senaki were occupied and went on to make the risible claim that the whole of georgia had been cut in two there was only one slight problem with that thesis it was pure bollocks as readers of this blog knew at the time put bluntly your friendly exile got the story right and most of the media just got it wrong is my work worth a donation is a fiver too much to ask
3747429 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
3747430 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
3747431 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
3747432 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
3747433 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
3747434 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
3747435 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats

3747440 id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3747441 whoever photoshopped our poster must have done so at taser point with three minutes to fulfill their hostage takers deranged obligations
3747442 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3747443 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3747444 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact
3747445 in light of the potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires
3747446 we anticipate an appeal by either the united states or one or more of the interveners
3747447 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3747448 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3747449 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3747450 will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
3747451 because the circumstances around the sec emergency order were so unusual im not sure we can gather any real lessons from trading activity during this period
3747452 i think theres curiosity about whether there will be any changes in trading but i havent heard any specific concerns
3747453 does not have a basis for determining that the 19 companies remain especially vulnerable to the illegal distort and short schemes that the emergency order prevented
3747454 the range of homes is low enough so we can pay for it right now
3747455 right now is the time for first time buyers like us who couldnt afford it earlier to take advantage of the low prices
3747456 flippers who depend on a home price appreciation to make money cant really make any money because there is no appreciation and there wont be for years
3747457 the sales are being driven by foreclosed properties and bargain hunters will of course take advantage of that
3747458 banks are not financing loans for any homes that are not meant to be lived in and many qualified buyers are not being approved by overcautious banks
3747459 most of the distress we are now seeing is largely a function of previous bad lending practices
3747460 the current spike is only a trend in a sub category of activity and its difficult to call it a long term trend
3747461 there is a more deep seated concern about what is happening to the global economy
3747462 are people relying too much on the oil price decline
3747463 the difference between people who carry credit card debt and those who dont is that the people who do not use plastic to supplement their income dont feel deprived when they cant have it now

3747471 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3747472 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3747473 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3747474 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3747475 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3747476 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3747477 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3747478 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3747479 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3747488 ze hebben het ons heel moeilijk gemaakt ik zou graag een extra dag rust willen
3747489 ik ben blij met de manier waarop ik momenteel speel
3747490 ik weet hoe moeilijk het is om hier het goud te winnen ik bekijk het van partij tot partij
3747491 beide gebaren zijn ook waar te nemen bij apen als uitdrukking van dominantie en onderwerping
3747492 ik ben heel tevreden met ons spel we hebben heel volwassen gespeeld maar ik ben totaal ontevreden over de strafcorners we hebben er al duizenden getraind en normaal missen we amper stops maar hier hebben we er 3 of 4 gemist dat is heel frustrerend maar we werken eraan de spelers in kwestie zijn daar natuurlijk ook ontgoocheld over maar er zijn al enkele teams die problemen hebben op dit veld om de bal te stoppen we hebben in de recente wedstrijden nu 5 punten gepakt tegen duitsland nadat we daarvoor 28 jaar op rij hadden verloren hopelijk kunnen we binnenkort ook de negatieve trend tegen andere topteams ombuigen
3747493 we hebben heel zwaar gewerkt in deze partij gewerkt als een team in de tweede helft waren we fysiek beter dan de duitsers we hebben in het begin wat geluk gehad maar in de tweede helft kenden we ook enkele keren malchance tegen spanje in de eerste wedstrijd zat alles goed vast maar bij de duitsers was het tactisch minder compact een punt gehaald uit de eerste twee wedstrijden tegen de twee zwaarste tegenstanders dat is wat we wilden
3747494 nu nog winnen van nieuw zeeland en dan hebben we misschien zelfs nog kans op de top 2 in de poule al droom ik nu misschien een beetje te veel het duel tegen nieuw zeeland wordt heel moeilijk vooral fysiek het wordt een belangrijke wedstrijd al die belgische supporters hier gaven me wel kippenvel en ook de nederlanders supporterden voor ons
3747495 dit is een geweldige prestatie in de tweede helft waren we veel beter vooral fysiek wij hadden de betere kansen het is vreemd om dat te zeggen na een wedstrijd tegen de wereldkampioen maar we zijn zelfs een beetje gefrustreerd dat we hier slechts n punt uit halen als we dit niveau kunnen aanhouden in de andere wedstrijden dan kunnen we nog een mooie prestatie neerzetten in dit toernooi we verbeteren alsmaar

3747520 designed to secure both physical and virtual environments through a single management window such a solution helps security administrators rapidly implement policies software based access management is helping organizations protect their critical business assets and enabling them to focus key staff on strategic projects
3747521 if you layer thousands of security rules and access control lists over hundreds of internal firewalls and vlans its easy to imagine the maintenance challenges organizations face
3747522 and if you add the fact that firewalls and vlans are static in nature and one of the premises of server virtualization is migration the management challenges are compounded
3747523 it is imperative that it administrators look for a software based access management solution that enables centralized management of security policies
3747524 the end result should be a simplification of security administration with a superior solution that supports both physical and virtual environments
3747525 securing physical and virtual it assets without hardware firewall or vlans
3747526 we understand the heartache parents face when they cant meet the needs of their children and we wanted to help

3747529 cathy and ralph oats and a lot of us have experienced others lending a helping hand so at wellness international network we embrace opportunities to help others
3747530 as a parent you feel fortunate to provide for your children and you know how you would be affected if you couldnt provide for them
3747531 making sure children have what they need and taking the burden off those parents who have to explain to their children why they cant have certain things is very gratifying
3747532 aberdeens research shows point of sale pos transaction data from retail locations is still a hurdle for 66 of manufacturers the low levels of transaction data sharing cause increased complexities in tracking promotion effectiveness at the store or field level

3747746 ive had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my list
3747747 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3747748 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation

3747759 jetzt bin ich zur ckgekommen um beim hsv auf der bank zu sitzen
3747760 der hsv ist seit fast 50 jahren in der bundesliga und hat in dieser zeit fast 100 mal gegen bayern gespielt niemand versteht dass es f r mich interessant ist mit meinem land das viertelfinale bei olympia erreichen zu k nnen das kann ich nicht begreifen
3747761 f r mich ist das aus sportlicher sicht eine logische entscheidung
3747762 jetzt bin ich zur ckgekommen um beim hsv auf der bank zu sitzen
3747763 ich habe juristisch nicht die kraft und die macht allein gegen den hsv zu k mpfen ich spiele nicht f r brasilien oder argentinien sondern f r ein kleines fu ball land unser verband hat angst vor dem hsv
3747764 ich werde am ende daf r bestraft dass ich vor olympia einen kompromiss eingegangen bin ich bin der einzige spieler der zur ckgerufen wurde schalke und werder haben auch wichtige spiele aber rafinha und diego die einfach abgehauen sind spielen weiter bei olympia
3747765 alle haben sich gegen mich gerichtet und auf mich eingetreten ich wurde so dargestellt als h tte ich die abmachung mit dem verein gebrochen das ist falsch
3747766 mir wurde gesagt dass die sportliche situation bei olympia einfluss auf die entscheidung habe jetzt bin ich der verlierer jeder sollte sich fragen ob es l cherlich ist dass ich f r mein land spielen wollte

3747773 they were in a two vehicle convoy they were american canadian and irish
3747774 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3747775 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3747776 we dont know yet how many men carried out the attack
3747777 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3747778 i am happy with the outcome i am also extremely pleased to have managed to keep the game at its original venue this is definitely a victory for the clubs the psl and soccer in the country
3747779 they listened to our case and our explanation and changed their minds and allowed the game to go ahead on saturday
3747780 they showed understanding and commitment for the local game i assured them that the league will continue to co operate and assist them to meet their deadlines for upgrading the stadium in time for the kick off of the confederations cup next june
3747781 the rugby match was a scheduled one while the soccer game was given to us at the last minute we are behind with our upgrading scheduled and had arranged extra work to be done to the stadium on saturday and sunday we would normally not turn down a money spinning soccer match involving chiefs and swallows
3747782 the contractors indicated that hosting the match on saturday would impact negatively on their planning we subsequently had lengthy discussions with the psl and other stake holders to try and save the situation and it was agreed that an exception would be made for the match to go ahead

3747792 i am happy we got everything sorted out last saturday i am glad i just missed one day of practice
3747793 five years ago i joined sauerland event and ever since then my career has taken a much more professional and organised course
3747794 we have proven in the last couple of years that we can work together well
3747795 we look forward to continuing the successful cooperation nikolai s signature is a very important part of our future plans everybody was convinced that it would be best to sign the contract before the next fight for us it was important to show nikolai that he has our full backing the axis between st petersburg berlin and fort lauderdale will remain alive
3747796 he is a tough quick aggressive fighter in the ring and a class act out of it its a wide open welterweight division kermit is a devastating puncher and certainly has the ability to win another world title
3747797 i think that lou dibella has the right people around him hes a very good promoter who can take me back to the top
3747798 kermit is still a young man in the prime of his career and losing to a fighter the caliber of margarito is certainly no disgrace
3747799 kermit is an intelligent athlete who knows exactly what he has to do to get to the top of the most talented division in boxing we will help him get there
3747800 the loss started a downward spiral because i really didnt think id lose
3747801 this is a big fight for me strohls 27 5 with 21 knockouts hes a big puncher who has come down from heavyweight i boxed him a lot when i lived in las vegas hes slow but very strong and always in great shape i know all about him and im a better boxer im going to win impressively if not by knockout ill outbox him badly hes going to be right in front of me and hell keep coming i have to sit down on my punches i havent been getting as many knockouts because the opposition has been better than the guys i fought earlier in my career i can still put people to sleep
3747802 anytime you have either of these guys fighting as the main event on a show its going to be an exciting night of boxing now that we have both kevin and mike on the same card together i can only begin to imagine what ballys is going to be like that night we feel that both mike and kevin are ready to challenge for major world titles and we expect them to both look spectacular and put on a great show come september 5th
3747803 ballys atlantic city will host an incredible night of boxing action on september 5th both main events feature not only local fighters but local fighters that excite fans and leave everything they have in the ring arnaoutis has really connected with the atlantic city fans and were excited to get a look at kevin johnson during his rise to top of the heavyweight division this is shaping up to be must see fight card
3747804 i am so pleased to have mark on the card i think it was a forgone conclusion he would be added after the magnificent show he put on at the salem fight back in june i just couldnt leave him out hes a true star he made that event a huge success and will help make the casino battle royale an even bigger success
3747805 i couldnt have asked for a better birthday present his birthday is the16th august this is a big event i will be up for it im an entertainer thats what i do i fight and entertain ill steal the show get me in the ring dont care who with ill beat them cos thats what i do and i do it with style you should call me the entertainer
3747806 we hate some persons because we do not know them and we will not know them because we hate them
3747807 i think the most memorable story i heard was when somebody said when they were going through a breakup your song motivated them to get back in the game and they give you the credit for that
3747808 or they heard my song and picked up a guitar and started writing songs and now have a way to channel their emotions things like that really move me
3747809 im not sure that it was quite 1 million but it was pretty up there i got a custom made tour bus with a fireplace a pull down treadmill all kinds of cool stuff its got hardwood floors
3747810 i had to have it because thats what i live on the majority of my time is spent on the road and when im out there you want to be comfortable and feel like youre home
3747811 i think everybody has a little bit of rebellion in them but for me it comes out in my songs
3747812 my rebellion is writing a song about a guy and putting his name in a song
3747813 hes got such a unique voice that people would definitely be able to tell that it was him on the track
3747814 its great meeting all the different people through the job i certainly find that interesting
3747815 all of the people that had camped there 30 years before remembered camping there it has been extremely popular since so that certainly is very satisfying

3747873 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect

3747879 this court is mindful of the expense involved in a trial of this magnitude as well as the uncomfortable position of the judge in such a bench trial
3747880 but it is not the role of the court to tailor its ruling to avoid awkward situations or to let expediency and cost savings dictate legal outcomes especially on issues of such importance
3747881 it has been a long and difficult process but we are close to the point where our attorneys will be able to explain in a court of law why the state of georgia is not meeting its responsibility in the education of our students
3747882 i expected the judge to rule in our favor and that the case would go on to trial
3747883 im not surprised i have felt as most of us did that we had a very strong constitutional standing with regard to the applicability of the lawsuit the funding is inadequate
3747884 its frustrating because taxpayers are paying both sides of this lawsuit
3747885 theyre paying their local taxes to their school systems who are buying into this consortium and theyre paying their state taxes for the state to defend a lawsuit when there is a public policy process that is in place to address school funding

3747903 if i was you i would have killed myself along time ago how the fuck do you hold on
3747904 i never asked for any of this im trying my best to turn it into something i can be proud of but that doesnt mean im not angry with you for being a twisted fucking waste i hope you enjoy the taste
3747905 i think the difference between me and every other idol that i know of ive done a lot of research on this is that i was the first to come in and have had a successful indie career before idol
3747906 grew up listening only to classical music in a regimented upbringing
3747907 i had seven credits left to graduate got called up the last day of the semester and was asked not to return to bob jones university i was a little upset at first but i just went and finished up at a different college called north greenville college it was kind of a healing experience coming out of bob jones and spending the next two and a half years at a great college that understood my view of who christ is was really kind of interesting and very cool
3747908 i love the show but at the same time there are some cheesy aspects i poked fun at and there are people who love the show so much that anything you say bad about the show or simon as i did for instance they will literally write you hate mail i had a blog and i would get hate mail for weeks after my comment to simon people said they hoped i would die because i told simon i didnt sound like the teletubbies it kind of freaked me out i hoped that people would realise that me joking around about the show was very tongue in cheek
3747909 i would say probably half the record is directed more to the church and the other half is just whatever i want to talk about one of my favourite quotes is from c s lewis where he says we dont need christians to talk about christian things we need christians to talk about many things i feel like thats kind of an art thats been lost over the last few we have this delineation between christian music and mainstream music and i just dont know that in life that theres supposed to be a delineation between our christian walk and our regular walk
3747910 obamas celebrity friends are bringing their considerable resources to bear in this election threatening this campaign with legal action over our latest ad fan club apparently we are not in fact worthy
3747911 when it was painted bright pink it was totally unacceptable
3747912 it vandalising is going to become the local game now
3747913 its not the councils job to deliberately offend people and by leaving it there we would deliberately offend people
3747914 they werent able to remove the graffiti so they removed the whole sculpture come on guys
3747915 i think its old fashioned and prudish and my wife is pretty amazed bloody ignorant was her term for it
3747916 the sculpture isnt lewd it isnt erotic and it isnt graphic it acknowledges female beauty and i felt very humble to be able to create it
3747917 most women have been supportive of the piece and i think it comes back to some old male primal issue about being envious of the female power to procreate and to give birth
3747918 children dont have the issue with it nudity its the adults who do
3747919 we dont want to explain it to children but thats furthering the ignorance of peoples bodies
3747920 i have a four year old daughter and as soon as we could we were explaining all of the parts of her body not 95 of it
3747921 council could have contacted me when the graffiti was painted and i could have helped them with cleaning it up
3747922 the previous council didnt object to it and there wasnt any issue back then when joy leishman was mayor of caboolture and now there seems to be
3747923 it would have been nice to have been contacted about it and discuss it

3748015 after years of growth airports are delaying capital projects freezing hiring and considering increases in everything from landing fees to parking concessionaires are hurting and many expect to close the problems are greatest at secondary airports that are losing a bigger share of their flights and lack international service to shore up weak domestic traffic

3748026 towards the end of the 14th or at least quite at the beginning of the 15th century not in gloucester itself as being too southerly but in the north of gloucestershire or in the neighbouring north of herefordshire or even possibly in the south of worcestershire
3748027 these rules of decorum read very curiously in the present age but their inapplicability to the circumstances of the working masons of the fourteen or fifteenth century will be at once apparent they were intended for the gentlemen of those days and the instruction for behaviour in the presence of a lord at table and in the society of ladies would have all been equally out of place in a code of manners drawn up for the use of a guild or craft of artisans
3748028 compiled and written in the southeastern portion of the western midlands say in gloucestershire or oxfordshire possibly also in southeast worcestershire or southwest warwickshire the book of charges which forms the second part of the document is certainly of the 14th century the historical or first part of quite the beginning of the 15th

3748033 adam our first parent created after the image of god the great architect of the universe must have had the liberal sciences particularly geometry written on his heart etc
3748034 of this distinguished brother we know very little he is believed to have been born educated and made a mason in scotland subsequently settling in london as a presbyterian minister he is mentioned for the first time in the proceedings of the grand lodge of england on september 29th 1721 when he was appointed to revise the old gothic constitutions this revision was approved by the grand lodge of england on september 29th in 1723 in which year anderson was junior grand warden under the duke of wharton he published a second edition of the book of constitutions in 1738 and died in 1739 this is about all that is known of him

3748126 tengo la seguridad de que los diputados socialistas no van a votar en contra del gobierno de zapatero sea cual sea la provincia por la que hayan resultados elegidos para los socialistas son mas importantes las personas que los territorios
3748127 ese convencimiento nace de la experiencia que durante muchos a os m s de un siglo ha acumulado el partido socialista nuestra fuerza es nuestra uni n
3748128 la importancia que el presidente del gobierno tiene a la hora de conseguir votos para que un candidato socialista obtenga su acta de diputado
3748129 todos los diputados socialistas saben y tenemos muy reciente la lecci n porque las elecciones han sido el pasado mes de marzo que ha pesado m s en el voto ciudadano el liderazgo de zapatero que el de cualquier dirigente regional del partido socialista argument los ciudadanos los electores los dirigentes y los diputados socialistas sabemos que zapatero pesa electoralmente m s que todos los l deres regionales socialistas juntos
3748130 no es desprecio hacia nadie todos somos necesarios continu pero sin la fuerza pol tica que zapatero representa quiz muchos de nosotros no ser amos diputados hay que ser aut nomos pero hay que tener los pies en el suelo y saber que sin las siglas de nuestro partido y sin zapatero muchos no ser amos diputados
3748131 discutir es ara ar hasta el ltimo euro y esto es lo que est n haciendo las diversas comunidades aut nomas y tambi n catalu a reconoci esto es normal y no debe escandalizarnos
3748132 tenemos que compatibilizar del principio de autonom a de los territorios con el principio de igualdad de los ciudadanos pero yo no tengo dudas en caso de conflicto entre la autonom a de un territorio y la igualdad de los ciudadanos debe prevalecer para un socialista la igualdad
3748133 y as tiene que ser porque pagar m s impuestos no puede generar m s derechos apostill ser a el colmo de la insolidaridad que quien m s impuestos paga creyera que tiene por ello m s derechos el hecho de ser rico no puede ser para un socialista un t tulo frente a quien es menos rico o m s pobre esto es lo que nos han ense ado desde pablo iglesias
3748134 en el socialismo no se entender a que alguien dijera que hemos de ser cada vez menos solidarios es como si un cristiano dijera que hay que poner l mite a la fe que hay que creer en dios pero un poquito menos cada d a asever los l mites deben ponerse a las injusticias no a la solidaridad
3748135 hay manifestaciones que por su propia naturaleza el que las hace querr a haberlas borrado creo que ha habido una rectificaci n pero la verdad no estoy muy al tanto
3748136 la constituci n puede m s que cualquier otra norma inferior que se le oponga
3748137 la constituci n es la ley general luego hay normas que tienen rango inferior y tambi n habr quienes frente a la ley general quieran leyes privadas que no son sino el origen de los privilegios dijo pero un privilegio es lo contrario a la constituci n privilegio etimol gicamente procede de ley privada
3748138 quien pretendiera hoy abrirse paso con planteamientos de insolidaridad recibir a el castigo social de la ciudadan a
3748139 a la inmensa mayor a de los espa oles sean vascos madrile os o catalanes les repugna la idea de los privilegios es decir que alguien tenga m s derechos que otro por raz n de nacimiento de sangre de rh
3748140 para defender la igualdad de los espa oles ya est la constituci n que es el gran pacto que se ha dado la propia sociedad espa ola
3748141 no tengan miedo garantiz la constituci n prevalecer y la igualdad entre los espa oles en derechos y oportunidades saldr triunfante frente a quienes desearan la desigualdad o frente a quienes aspiran a comer aparte de los dem s casi siempre quien desea comer aparte es porque quiere comer m s que los dem s
3748142 a estas alturas el tripartito y ciu deber an haber acordado el no a los pge
3748143 our focus is on led lighting products and fixtures that can directly replace existing incandescent fluorescent and halogen bulbs in any household or commercial application
3748144 the extendlite led lights provide consumers with more versatility and make it easier to do so
3748145 leds can last up to 100 000 hours approximately 11 years and operate more than 20 times longer than the equivalent incandescent lamp
3748146 savings from reduced maintenance costs and downtime quickly return the capital investment expenditure and led lamps require 80 90 less operating power than their incandescent equivalents making them as friendly to the environment as they are to the operating budget

3748152 a d a de hoy nada hace pensar que se quede a la improvisaci n
3748153 todo el mundo se ha puesto las pilas y est trabajando
3748154 lo mejor es que hab a una voluntad pol tica de solucionarlo y sab amos c mo por lo que me preocupaba relativamente
3748155 la imagen que podemos dar como pa s y del gran premio de europa

3748157 sinceramente si fuera valenciano me sentir a muy satisfecho y muy orgulloso de tener un gran premio de f1 en valencia
3748158 evidentemente hab a problemas de juventud pero eso lo tenemos tambi n si fuera una instalaci n permanente
3748159 nuestro inter s era hacer una carrera de ensayo antes para que se detectaran esos problemas
3748160 est n trabajando con el tiempo suficiente para que la pista est dispuesta para el jueves que empezar n a rodar los coches
3748161 al menos he sumado cuatro puntos y mantengo el liderato
3748162 he sumado unos puntos muy valiosos de cara al final de la temporada
3748163 es el momento que esperaba desde que vi la posibilidad de ser piloto
3748164 hac a mucho que no pod a luchar con rivales fuertes de t a t
3748165 somos un equipo totalmente comprometido con la igualdad en el trato a nuestros pilotos
3748166 este resultado se corresponde con el esfuerzo del equipo en los ltimos meses
3748167 los pilotos deber an mirar mejor pos los espejos retrovisores
3748168 estamos pasando por un momento complicado pero no debemos rendirnos
3748169 adelantar en este circuito no es f cil pero intentar luchar por la victoria

3748174 but things are definitely not as good as i thought it would be maybe if we were near the main venue
3748175 i love the olympics i like any event where the chinese could win a gold medal
3748176 thats the nature of these sports venues nearly anywhere in the world
3748177 they are completely distinct walled off by parking lots and have almost nothing to do with their environments
3748178 i moved here because they turned my last house into a subway stop because of the olympics
3748179 there were thousands of people living there we all had to leave

3748184 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3748185 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3748186 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3748187 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3748188 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3748189 the best part of having the tournament is to see how people really step up to help
3748190 safelite helps out our insurance agents and restoration companies get involved its just great to see people show up and we all go home knowing we made a very deserving girl feel a little bit better
3748191 levitt first became involved with real estate agents when buying a house he felt they were subtly encouraging him to bid low this seemed to make no sense because real estate agents are paid by commission but he took a closer look at the structure of the commissions
3748192 paul no 45 down the road here is up for sale could be what youre looking for
3748193 someone obviously broke the womans window out but that could have been anybody
3748194 when they closed the door he went to the window and was still yelling
3748195 one of the brothers picked up a small coffee table and threw it at the window in attempt to scare him off
3748196 fueron m s de diez horas de metal ardiente pero salimos vivos 20 mil personas personajes de toda cala a bebidas de todos los colores calor y lluvia torrencial y un show de slipknot y disturbed para el recuerdo
3748197 massachusetts recently passed laws promoted by governor patrick to encourage competition in the insurance industry
3748198 house bill 5056 is the final piece of that puzzle and will compliment the governors initiative by creating more competition more products and better services by collision repairers and other segments of our industry
3748199 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent
3748200 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3748201 it was a little too hard for me to get out of that funk
3748202 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3748203 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3748204 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3748205 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3748206 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope
3748207 in china well have more people coming into gymnasiums and we will be stronger in the future
3748208 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3748209 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3748210 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3748211 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3748212 what if they dont see eye to eye with you on things and wish you harm
3748213 what if they take your world for granted and trample upon it
3748214 its not really where my career goals are focused right now
3748215 im really looking down the line pretty far and this might be a step backwards
3748216 food safety experts have advised parents to eliminate a series of additives from their childrens diet while they await the publication of a new study that is understood to link these ingredients to behaviour problems in youngsters

3748219 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3748220 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3748221 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to
3748222 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3748223 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3748224 ive seen the pictures of the baby and she looks like john edwards
3748225 shes got his eyes jaw line and lips but she does have rielles nose my niece is not a bastard child i just dont think its right
3748226 the most shocking thing was watching him on tv giving half truths these half baked answers i wish for everyone involved that hed come clean
3748227 a big hug and apologize im very ashamed my sister had an affair with a public man shes not the first person to make this mistake and wont be the last
3748228 i was kind of fascinated by her and her friends
3748229 i saw them as a tribe that i wanted to study
3748230 is about a group of girls five or six friends coming to new york and conquering or failing to conquer the city
3748231 theyve started letting them out of the bus in front of our house
3748232 if were about to leave and someone yells star tours you hit the ground if you go down they cant see you
3748233 theyre both things that we cannot help i sympathize with my neighbors i wouldnt want to deal with that either were also victims of that though we dont want to deal with that they should be complaining to the city
3748234 i dont know about you all but cash and i have been glued to the olympics
3748235 how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they coordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3748236 the last time i got this excited watching sports was when friend and new los angeles clippers point guard baron davis was in the nba playoffs
3748237 i now call the quarterly meeting spouses of political philandering utter dumbasses sppud to order im pleased to announce and introduce the latest member of our club elizabeth edwards
3748238 ever since my husbands behavior with that thong wearing beret topped buys her dress at the gap willing to be satisfied with a cigar bitch became public i formed this club
3748239 we have our usual crowd tonight starting with our newer member silda spitzer
3748240 ladies it is only here that i can be at ease
3748241 donna hanover the former spouse of former mayor and former presidential candidate rudy guiliani
3748242 wasnt that a great primary season oh except for you hil sorry my friend
3748243 our good friend dina matos formerly mcgreevey couldnt be with us tonight as shes sitting by her phone waiting for the decision about how much money shell be getting from her soon to be ex husband the fruitcake jailbird pretending to be a studying to be a poverty stricken minister to avoid paying her what shes owed for putting up with his shenanigans
3748244 and now id like to introduce the latest member of our little club the little club that keeps on growing
3748245 hi ladies it is with a bit of sadness that i join your club i never ever thought id be here i always thought id be dead before i stood at the side of my man in one of those oops my dick accidentally landed in another woman moments and yet here i am just another member of the club you all know its been a tough couple of years for john amp me between the twins the chad election the cancer and the primaries things in our world have been emotional and hectic but he swore to me that he would never do anything to publically embarrass me i guess i should know better than to take a politician on his word you know i could almost handle the whole mistress thing if hed been up front with me im a reasonably pragmatic woman i know with all the cancer treatments and dealing with our children and death i havent always been the easiest woman to be around we had a deal nothing to jeopardize the dream but like so many high powered men that wasnt good enough not when there are plenty of women and men willing to do the nasty in whatever way they fantasize so here i stand and you know what unlike dina and silda im not going to write a tell all book im not looking for money or revenge ive got better things to do with whats left of my time im going to stand tall and apart from my husband im going to make sure hes so full of guilt that hell never be able to get an erection for the rest of his natural life and then with a little luck ill make sure he wont be able to sustain one in the afterlife
3748246 ladies enjoy the evening and lets hope that we dont get too many more members were running out of room here
3748247 consumers will have to pay more for food in coming years as demand from biofuel manufacturers has pushed up the prices of corn and other grains for the long term a senior economist of the us government has warned
3748248 prosz pa stwa oto mi mi jest bardzo grzeczny dzi
3748249 it never ceases to amaze but never surprises me of the generosity of our employees
3748250 in just a week they collected dozens of bags of pencils notebooks backpacks calculators and all the necessary supplies to start the school year off the right way for a lot of very deserving kids
3748251 we wish we could solve all the problems that exist in this world
3748252 we believe as a team if that everyone gives just a little together we can accomplish a lot
3748253 we encourage our fellow businesses here in jefferson county along with clubs and organizations to support the jeffco action center
3748254 theyre wonderful neighbors and friends of ours and are helping so many people who need a hand up not a hand out
3748255 we can usually work one day a week during the summer the girls are pretty good but only have so much patience
3748256 this years art show features some very talented new artists and pieces i cant wait to do my own holiday shopping there
3748257 to my citizens you will suffer certainly but we are in the midst of a terrible crisis
3748258 recently we discovered vast oil and natural gas resources in the arctic as the ice melts we have discovered a treasure chest of resources in its floes
3748259 there is a raccoon trap i knew about when i was a boy
3748260 we the american people if were not careful will do just as that raccoon
3748261 during world war ii the american people suffered a loss of daily amenities
3748262 ive seen contemporary girls with tatood lines up the backs of their legs in our word we dont know the kind of collective and democratic hardship now is our chance
3748263 it time to rally we will suffer pangs of awkwardness and loss this is not because we need to find more oil it is because we need to create alternative models of living if we do not stop now the pain of stopping will get exponentially harder as we destroy our environment the home of generations to come destroying also the faith in ourselves that we are capable of goodness the hunger for oil will tear us apart the world is watching america must set a standard if we do not no one will i am willing to suffer the brunt of resentment to do so my time is after all over so i will do this like a good parent i will tell you all we must stop
3748264 selbst in dieser kurzen zeit wurde die unseri se finanzpolitik des senats offenbar
3748265 der senat betreibt nicht nur eine kurzfristig orientierte und unsolide haushaltspolitik sondern bedient sich auch zahlreicher tricks andere f r sich schulden machen zu lassen wie das verschenken sanierungsbed rftiger schulgeb ude an die stadteigene saga oder die umstrukturierung der hafendienste steuererh hungen das verschieben von projekten und k rzungen bei bestimmten haushaltstiteln runden das schwarz gr ne finanzgebaren ab
3748266 mit der einf hrung der 6 j hrigen grundschule steht zu bef rchten dass die soziale auslese im schulsystem nicht sp ter sondern fr her einsetzen wird die abschaffung der hauptschule war die beste entscheidung die bisher getroffen wurde aber wie die umsetzung funktionieren wird ist noch offen und unterst tzungsma nahmen f r die verbleibenden hauptsch ler fehlen
3748267 mit der einf hrung der nachgelagerten studiengeb hren werden jetzt ber 15 000 studierende mehr zur kasse gebeten zudem stellt die koalition pl tzlich fest dass die universit t marode ist damit private investoren an bord geholt werden k nnen
3748268 ein kohlekraftwerk wird nicht mehr ausgeschlossen die elbvertiefung und der ausbau der a 26 werden durchgef hrt die mittel f r die bezuschussung von solaranlagen werden gek rzt
3748269 der senat setzt die sozialpolitik der vorg nger senate fort
3748270 die gr nen haben sich von ihren eigenen forderungen verabschiedet seit sie mitregieren wie die ablehnung eines preiswerten sozialtickets und des armuts und reichtumsberichts zeigen
3748271 kulturpolitik besteht f r den senat haupts chlich aus der teuren pflege der leuchtt rme trotz offensichtlicher haushaltsprobleme die stadtteil und basiskultur wird hingegen str flich vernachl ssigt wie man an dem verkauf des musikbunkers und dem clubsterben erkennen kann
3748272 im bereich der innen und rechtspolitik l sst die praxis der polizeieins tze die durchsetzung des neonazi aufmarsches am 1 mai und der einsatz gegen die rote flora bef rchten dass der senat den law and order kurs von schill und nagel fortsetzt
3748273 f r kinder und jugendliche hat der senat wenig versprochen und wenig gehalten
3748274 nach dem schrecklichen mord an morsal o w re es vor allem erforderlich das problem grunds tzlich anzupacken
3748275 im gegenteil die dringenden probleme in der gesundheitspolitik haben noch keine anst e erfahren stattdessen wird die drogenhilfeeinrichtung subway geschlossen unverantwortlich es gab auch keinerlei initiativen f r die verwirklichung der gleichberechtigung der frauen mindestl hne m ssen f r hamburg her die vergabe ffentlicher auftr ge an die tarifbindung zu koppeln ist unabdingbar auch ber den 31 12 08 hinaus
3748276 i thought i knew everything about nutrition but this information actually relates to my life
3748277 i had already gotten so much publicity in the newspapers
3748278 a faithful minister in this kingdome and whose integritie is well knowne in ireland
3748279 there was a brave day in ireland on the last lords day april 7th at the swearing of the covenant in belfast by our army and sundry others
3748280 from 1605ad onward many scotsmen settled in londonderry and the neighbourhood so many that in 1644 when the solemn league and covenant was publicly signed in the diamond they formed the bulk of the population
3748281 in those places where the covenant was administered to the army the whole country about came and willingly joined themselves in the covenant
3748282 the lawfulness of resistance in the matter of the kings unjust invasion of life and religion
3748283 there was a brave day in ireland at the swearing of the covenant in belfast
3748284 the insurrection known by the name of the rising of pentland was nothing more than the intolerable oppressions of those times justified nature having dictated to people a right of defence when illegally and arbitrarily attacked in a manner not justifiable either by laws of nature the laws of god or the laws of the country
3748285 he simply got us confused and he gave permission to us and them at the same time without realizing it
3748286 i received emails about this cover from both authors or publishers in the same week
3748287 i am not a photo agency but a busy scientist so i dont keep very careful track of this sort of request of which i get too many and so yes in my mind i must have thought i was dealing with a single book and never realized i gave two permissions
3748288 i think its amusing that both decided to use the photo in about the same way but perhaps this is dictated with the vertical format of a book cover whereas the photo clearly is a horizontal one
3748289 querida eu tentei mas diante dessa situa o n o h o que fazer
3748290 invoca me no tempo da ang stia eu te livrarei e tu me glorificar s
3748291 oh look this picture its a fake this picture its a fake
3748292 apa itu dunia unipolar tidak kira bagaimana kita cuba mengubah maksudnya ia adalah pemusatan kepada satu kuasa satu kekuatan dan hanya satu tuan
3748293 ia tiada kaitan dengan demokrasi kerana pendapat majoriti diabaikan berbanding pendapat minoriti
3748294 mereka mengajar kita mengenai demokrasi tetapi mereka sendiri tidak mempelajari dan mengamalkannya
3748295 rusia sentiasa mengejar polisi luar bebas kami tidak akan mengubah tradisi itu hari ini
3748296 kami tidak akan menguatkuasakan perjanjian itu kerana ia akan membawa kepada kebuntuan sekiranya ada pihak yang terluka dalam proses sukar ini
3748297 the light the heat in your eyes i am complete
3748298 ive got to push myself harder because im out of shape
3748299 we were watching film tuesday and i wasnt hustling to the ball i could have had more tackles if i had hustled to the ball ive got to get used to the tempo full speed all the time
3748300 sometimes i just handed off the ball and sat back there and watched
3748301 playing quarterback in the triple option offense i was in shape but then i played basketball and was in shape a little bit more but after basketball season i didnt work out that much and got out of shape
3748302 it all started with the van not starting fully loaded with anticipation two anxious adults a teething baby one fidgety dog and mountains of badly packed furniture key in ignition nothing a flat battery meant everyone out and a two hour delay while it charged enough to take us to the channel tunnel broken windscreen wipers and heavy rain as soon as we crossed the channel nearly finished us off literally looking back it was the perfect prediction of how our new life in france was to be full of non starters disappointment and danger there has been some joy on the way but generally the bad has out weighed the good four years have passed since my ex partner son and i moved to the tarn and garonne in the south west of france we are still here but as the ex implies no longer together underlying problems in our relationship before we left made our eventual separation a possibility the stresses that came with living in france made it inevitable this is not a cautionary tale to anyone thinking about moving abroad in an attempt to solve problems in their relationship perhaps if we had made some wiser decisions or even had a bit more luck the outcome would have been very different who is to say but there are lessons to be learned from mistakes and out of hardship comes an appreciation for the truer things in life like health love family and friendship thankfully i still have these and treasure them more than anything financial though a bit more money would be nice i think my parents would agree
3748303 that this offer expires on 20 august 2008 4 00pm
3748304 oh nothing much fritter it away on expensive make up or the odd gucci handbag if the mood takes me what do you think you silly its 64 euros arent i allowed any kind of a life
3748305 as i am a single mum i try to put a bit aside for when i need to buy clothes or christmas presents for my 6 yr old son and sometimes i use it to buy birthday presents for his friends or to repair my car should it happen to break down oh and the odd stamp now and again too just little things like that
3748306 well it would seem not not unless you want to take the clothes off our backs
3748307 ok it would seem that we can extend your current payment policy for another 6 months but we will have to call at the end of it to review your situation again
3748308 to every morning go to the dining hall and get a big plate full of eggs so ive been trying to do that pretty regularly
3748309 that contributed a lot to it and the weight room is a very big part of it
3748310 no but keep in mind robert junior geathers played david pollack played charles johnson played as a freshman i coach them to get them ready to play now they understand that the very worst that is going to happen is ive got that much more ready for spring practice
3748311 not just quotable business figures such as rupert murdoch lou gerstner warren buffett sanford weill peter lynch and donald trump but fundamental economic thinkers such as robert solow paul samuelson james tobin milton friedman friedrich von hayek and c
3748312 i never had any intentions of going to georgia when they first offered
3748313 but i visited and loved it then i visited georgia again last week and loved it more
3748314 coach richt was real excited and then georgia assistant mike bobo told a funny story he said he had a dream about me that i signed with georgia but reported at 211 pounds he said oh no i thought you were going to be 245 because we really need that big tight end in our offense i was laughing the whole time
3748315 my mom loved coach richt and georgia which just confirmed how i felt about everything
3748316 i still cant believe this kid from massachusetts is going down to georgia and that the no 1 team in the country wanted me so badly my mom just said everything happens for a reason and shes right
3748317 so if something should go wrong the big company has little place to turn for their recourse
3748318 usually in excess of what s necessary from the entrepreneur s point of view and this inevitably makes life difficult for them to get along
3748319 ask me in a week and i might respond by saying everythings going to be ok but im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3748320 hes talented enough to play right tackle probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to the left tackle
3748321 that would exhaust the possibilities but at least we have possibilities
3748322 we anticipate with rehabilitation he should be able to come back and continue his career
3748323 its definitely a huge loss for us on the offense
3748324 trintons a great player and a great person but weve still got 14 games to play hopefully were a resilient team we understand its a loss but weve suffered losses in the past when thomas brown went down last year knowshon moreno stepped up there are instances across the board where people go down and other people step up its the sign of a good team hopefully we can do that
3748325 hugh was the heartbeat and the toughness and the soul of that team
3748326 maybe if you asked me in a week i could tell you that everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3748327 it was definitely a huge loss for us on offense
3748328 weve still got 14 games to play hopefully its tough for him we know but we have to find somebody to plug in the spot were a resilient team we understand its a loss but weve suffered losses in the past when thomas brown went down last year knowshon moreno stepped up
3748329 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do
3748330 from day 1 of spring practice last year i definitely saw that he had it
3748331 he had what it took to be a premier player in this league especially playing left tackle which is such a vital position he had all the physical tools once he understood the plays that he was running he did a great job i was definitely thinking he would have a great year no 2 its unfortunate he got hurt i hate it for him
3748332 i think his energy level moved up a notch thinking he might be the guy
3748333 its going to be a real vital part of the team to see whos going to step up
3748334 i dont even know who coach searels is going to put in that spot whoever it is the guys got to pick it up and step up around him coach searels is a great coach a real unbelievable teacher of the game im sure whoever it is hell have him ready

3748343 materials were too costly to transport materials and the difficulty in loading them from the ports of manila and subic
3748344 very low profile yet charismatic curator bobi valenzuela is almost invincible no one knows how intense and far reaching it has become
3748345 strangely enough i never really took art seriously at first
3748346 i found it too ridiculous that art will just be ultimately consigned to the empty walls of a bored housewifes mansion
3748347 the 80s was the height of excessive commodification of art the genre then was either flowers or abstract art tell me how many mother and child do you need to see how many million flowers or butterflies do you need to excite you
3748348 because we didnt have a word for art i named it hiraya which is an archaic visayan word for imagination art is the soul of the people its dreams expressions and aspirations however ours has been polluted as a result of spanish and american colonization

3748351 philippine art has been relocated to interior designers whose aesthetic preference for art relies on how much its brush strokes blend with the colors of the walls or curtains of ones house

3748353 santi was way way ahead of his time and he was consistent with his art when he died parang nawalan na rin ako ng gana sa art
3748354 in hindsight i lament how some artists i used to work with either continue to deteriorate only to lose their luster ultimately
3748355 our misfortune is the lack of credible artists these recent years
3748356 they are in the arts either for quick fame or easy money you start repeating yourself and thats the start of your end
3748357 art thrives kasi marami pang dapat baguhin sa mundo natin pag bumuti buti ito unti unti na ring mawawalan ng silbi ang art in the meantime between art and life i will choose life anytime
3748358 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right
3748359 we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
3748360 damn shes right the democratic nomination was still up in the air when rfk was assassinated and that was june 5
3748361 that was a bad thing to say people will freak out and misinterpret it
3748362 because it is what tourists look for and done with ease
3748363 the botong ones because it is what tourists like and done with ease
3748364 during my time you were an artist first and possess a soul second that one is considered fortunate if one sells two paintings in a year
3748365 our artists start out becoming artist not by observation of nature but by exposure to art
3748366 if youre a good artist then your work will automatically be filipino

3748380 theres spiders beetles crawling all over the boat im freaking out because the boats like the size of a tub
3748381 jeff kept saying give it some time give it some time but we didnt catch nothing
3748382 so we were stuck out there for about 20 minutes trying to get it untangled
3748383 i think its crucial because up front weve got to get pressure on the quarterback and make the quarterback make mistakes
3748384 if he forgets a call or they come out with some funky formation he knows he can always look for me and ill help him out
3748385 my whole goal coming to georgia was to win a national championship

3748462 there by the way where did the documentary on or go this post from a norwegian magazine where okkervil apparently did more press than in sweden will speaks about norwegian black metal especially on a pathetic figurine who is responsible for burning churches and murdering a fellow musician wills words calling somebody like varg vikernes a psychopath is almost flattering thats what he wants everybody to believe but the truth of the matter is that he was a dumb kid who wanted to impress people and disconnected from reality enough that he got himself into deep shit now i think he probably deeply regrets it hes now constantly trying to get out of prison constantly trying to get his sentence shortened with good behaviour but the fact that he is propagating so much neo nazi rhetoric in jail all the time hes trying to come up with a new term for it so it doesnt seem as connected with naziism sic apart from having made up a new word will obviously has a point vikernes is plain stupid and disturbed not insane for those who do not know of it the norwegian black metal scene is quite singular as its base youve got young males uniting through simple loud music nothing new there but then somehow they all lose the plot by bonding through satanism im not saying thats more or less wrong than people forming christian bands its the very same thing my problem is when violence and nazism gets involved which often has been the case with leading norwegian black metal people such as vikernes and rob darken who is also known for posing in 9 in national socialist black metal

3748468 i njunction is an equitable remedy which should not be lightly indulged in but used sparingly and only in a clear and plain case
3748469 the reluctance to exercise this drastic power should be especially great where temporary relief is sought
3748470 likelihood of success is the touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry
3748471 not find irreparable injury where only money is at stake and where the plaintiff has a satisfactory remedy at law to recover the money at issue
3748472 not readily susceptible of calculation and likely would not be recovered from the defendants

3748474 mit undergrads stated that they did not intend to harm the mbta
3748475 key information needed to compromise both the charlie ticket and the charlie card is not present in the slides
3748476 t he slides depict a field called checksum and show that it changes when the ticket value changes but do not describe how to compute the checksum
3748477 we have purposefully omitted details of this checksum in any public disclosures
3748478 must be concerned not only with possible injury to a plaintiff but also with possible injury to the defendant
3748479 the loss of first amendment freedoms for even minimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury
3748480 mit undergrads were scheduled to give their the anatomy of a subway hack presentation at 1 00 on sunday august 10 2008
3748481 whether this is in fact a prank or whether the mit undergrads are in fact able to compromise the fare media system in the manner they publicly claim
3748482 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with
3748483 the public interest carries considerable weight in these matters the court must weigh any hindrance or furtherance of the public interest likely to result from interim injunctive relief
3748484 protecting rights to free speech is ipso facto in the interest of the general public
3748485 prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights
3748486 comes to the court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity
3748487 in the case of a prior restraint on pure speech the hurdle is substantially higher than for an ordinary preliminary injunction publication must threaten an interest more fundamental than the first amendment itself indeed the supreme court has never upheld a prior restraint even faced with the competing interest of national security or the sixth amendment right to a fair trial
3748488 i t is clear that few things save grave national security concerns are sufficient to override first amendment interests
3748489 researchers discover flaws they invent new and improved ways to detect and correct flaws and they invent new and improved approaches to system design and implementation this investigative approach has driven the computer systems field forward at an 15
3748490 when large public security systems are at issue the norm in our field is that researchers take reasonable steps avoid inadvertently teaching others how to exploit the flaw
3748491 although the prohibition against prior restraints is by no means absolute the gagging of publication has been considered acceptable only in exceptional circumstances
3748492 means not only informed and responsible criticism but the freedom to speak foolishly and without moderation

3748537 the bart policy which the board of directors will consider thursday would prohibit segways and similar self balancing self propelled transport vehicles from being brought into stations by people who do not have disabilities people with disabilities would be able to obtain a permit upon proving a need for the device it would allow them to ride the device into the station and onto the concourse but they would have to turn it off and push it on platforms and aboard trains
3748538 turn it off and push it on platforms and aboard trains
3748539 only about 20 people a day use the devices on bart bart spokesman linton johnson said but the agency feared that use could increase with high gas prices the growing interest in public transit and the introduction of segway like devices that cost less you can image the problem if use of these things really took off he said
3748540 bob planthold a disability rights activist and head of the metropolitan transportation commissions advisory committee said he believes the policy protects the safety of bart riders while still allowing the use of the devices by people with disabilities
3748541 i would not want people to think this is primarily a mobility assisting device for people with disabilities
3748542 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3748639 the vetting that goes on by angel flight i know they do their best to find the safest combination of pilots and airplanes but since they are not a commercial carrier there is a level there that they simply cant arise to
3748640 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3748641 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3748642 es ist uns erstmalig gelungen wichtige materialeigenschaften dieses sensors kleines bild rechts im nanobereich zu messen um damit unser modell der wirkungsweise weiter zu best tigen
3748643 die zahl ist nicht wissenschaftlich belegt fest steht allerdings dass der sensor so empfindlich ist dass der k fer den brand aus mehreren kilometern entfernung detektieren kann
3748644 es ist uns aber gelungen der wirkweise dieses sensors der etwa f nfmal schneller als technische infrarot f hler arbeitet n her zu kommen
3748645 die sinneszelle mit der er das tut ist ein typischer mechano rezeptor wie er beispielsweise auch in vielen geh rorganen von insekten etwa bei heuschrecken oder grillen zum einsatz kommt
3748646 der druckbeh lter dessen einzig weiche stelle die spitze der sinneszelle ist die wie ein handschuhfinger in ihn hineinragt misst nur ein drittel der dicke eines menschlichen haares
3748647 das faszinierende an diesem mechanismus ist dass der k fer diese spannungs nderung schon wenige tausendstel sekunden nach dem infrarot puls registriert
3748648 this investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
3748649 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
3748650 we are changing the way ocean science is done launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans
3748651 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter

3748663 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3748664 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3748665 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3748666 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3748667 i love this sport especially endurance racing and this chance to step off the trail and give back to sport is tremendous we cant wait to come to north carolina for this world class endurance cycling event and festival
3748668 this is a true mountain bike festival with something for everyone with a bike and a little energy
3748669 were designing an endurance course that will challenge the top pros and amateurs and the whole weekend will be filled with chances to ride for fun and for prizes
3748670 do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own you may both be wrong
3748671 it is certainly the most demanding american stage race and i expect it to be one of the most competitive
3748672 but i think it is the type of race that really suits team type 1
3748673 this may be the biggest mountain event hes done with the team this year but he is so on top of his diabetes management that im sure he is going to play a big part in our attack

3748689 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3748690 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3748691 we are delighted to have secured an entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market
3748692 the markets of pipes and hollow structural sections are not linked with the consumers demand and are therefore more favorable
3748693 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3748694 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3748695 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3748696 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3748697 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3748698 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3748699 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3748700 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3748701 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3748702 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3748703 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3748704 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3748705 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3748706 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3748707 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3748708 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3748709 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3748710 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3748738 ryanair will from monday 11 august introduce new procedures to cancel all passenger bookings made through screen scraping websites
3748739 we believe this is a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity and we hope that by getting rid of screens crapers we will speed up passenger processing times on ryanair com as well as ensuring that ryanair passengers are not paying unnecessary handling charges or higher fares to screen scrapers
3748740 ryanair believes these screen scrapers are nothing more than video or software pirates and we will continue to campaign across europe for legislation to prohibit this unlawful screen scraping and this breach of copyright laws which will prevent these profiteering middlemen from engaging in the mis selling of ryanairs flights and information
3748741 ryanair is continuing to work with our software providers navitaire and microsoft to proactively eliminate screen scraping of ryanairs website
3748742 we hope this will ensure that genuine consumers can purchase europes guaranteed lowest air fares while enjoying rapid access and quicker processing times for their bookings on ryanair com
3748743 it is only through bravoflys websites and through its exclusive technologies that consumers are able to find this information information that is carefully hidden by airline companies such as ryanair who systematically adopt an insidious policy of unjust taxes on the base prices of airline tickets

3748836 we go out after games together we travel together and have fun together

3748860 we actually had the better of the early play against spain and missed a few chances
3748861 but it is definitely something we have to work on

3748889 lance corporal tatum is not trading his testimony for this dismissal
3748890 he may very well be called as a witness for the prosecution or the defense but he is going to be a neutral witness and will tell the truth as hes always done
3748891 i think when the prosecution realized we were going to trial and that he was going to tell the truth as he has all along this experienced set of prosecutors realized it wasnt really fair to dump all this on a lance corporal who was responding the way he was trained
3748892 in order to continue to pursue the truth seeking process into the haditha incident
3748893 to ensure the remaining cases are brought to closure in a fair and just manner further discussion of this case is inappropriate at this time

3748914 the shopping cart had the logo but it didnt say target or shop tomorrow
3748915 they wanted it to be subtle and thats why we went with it because it didnt seem to distract
3748916 we are trying to remove clutter to make sure viewers have the best possible experience if we start placing ads we will lose the value of promotions as a navigation tool
3748917 when we hit on the right program and marry it with the right ad it could happen but its not on the docket right now
3748918 i understand the networks are trying to monetize content and advertisers want their message to be seen but no one ever seems to think about the viewer

3748922 there is no explanation that justifies using a presentational format for news that makes it more difficult for viewers than it already is the data strongly suggest that the format harms story fact comprehension thus this cacophonous format appears to be one that can and should be better managed by television news producers
3748923 cognitive theory shows that people cant take in two messages they go back and forth
3748924 you are not taking away from the emotional engagement some networks put them in the middle of the action some at the end of the segment the problem is we dont know how to measure pushback is it when ratings go down we dont know where the boundary is until we cross it
3748925 you have to factor in duration is it an icon is it a link to information how impactful is it how prominent what show is it on the disadvantage is that you are in competition with the content of the program

3748950 tidakkah pernah kuberitahukan kepada kamu sesuatu yang derajatnya lebih tinggi daripada shalat puasa dan shadaqah yakni memperbaiki silaturahmi dengan sanak kerabat kita karena rusaknya sanak kerabat kita adalah sama dengan pencukur
3748951 kalau kami mempunyai doa yang lekas dikabulkan maka kami akan mendoakan penguasa karena sesungguhnya allah dapat melakukan perbaikan terhadap banyak makhluknya dengan kebaikan penguasa tersebut
3748952 satu hari dari imam yang adil adalah lebih afdal daripada ibadah enam puluh tahun

3749065 tengo la seguridad de que los diputados socialistas no van a votar en contra del gobierno de zapatero sea cual sea la provincia por la que hayan resultados elegidos para los socialistas son mas importantes las personas que los territorios
3749066 ese convencimiento nace de la experiencia que durante muchos a os m s de un siglo ha acumulado el partido socialista nuestra fuerza es nuestra uni n
3749067 la importancia que el presidente del gobierno tiene a la hora de conseguir votos para que un candidato socialista obtenga su acta de diputado
3749068 todos los diputados socialistas saben y tenemos muy reciente la lecci n porque las elecciones han sido el pasado mes de marzo que ha pesado m s en el voto ciudadano el liderazgo de zapatero que el de cualquier dirigente regional del partido socialista argument los ciudadanos los electores los dirigentes y los diputados socialistas sabemos que zapatero pesa electoralmente m s que todos los l deres regionales socialistas juntos
3749069 no es desprecio hacia nadie todos somos necesarios continu pero sin la fuerza pol tica que zapatero representa quiz muchos de nosotros no ser amos diputados hay que ser aut nomos pero hay que tener los pies en el suelo y saber que sin las siglas de nuestro partido y sin zapatero muchos no ser amos diputados
3749070 discutir es ara ar hasta el ltimo euro y esto es lo que est n haciendo las diversas comunidades aut nomas y tambi n catalu a reconoci esto es normal y no debe escandalizarnos
3749071 tenemos que compatibilizar del principio de autonom a de los territorios con el principio de igualdad de los ciudadanos pero yo no tengo dudas en caso de conflicto entre la autonom a de un territorio y la igualdad de los ciudadanos debe prevalecer para un socialista la igualdad
3749072 y as tiene que ser porque pagar m s impuestos no puede generar m s derechos apostill ser a el colmo de la insolidaridad que quien m s impuestos paga creyera que tiene por ello m s derechos el hecho de ser rico no puede ser para un socialista un t tulo frente a quien es menos rico o m s pobre esto es lo que nos han ense ado desde pablo iglesias
3749073 en el socialismo no se entender a que alguien dijera que hemos de ser cada vez menos solidarios es como si un cristiano dijera que hay que poner l mite a la fe que hay que creer en dios pero un poquito menos cada d a asever los l mites deben ponerse a las injusticias no a la solidaridad

3749099 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3749100 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3749101 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3749102 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3749103 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion

3749128 while we have not had major issues inside the stadium unruly behavior has been on an upswing across the league and we are going to do our part to ensure that fans feel safe and have an enjoyable experience
3749129 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
3749130 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale

3749170 how do we leave it better than we found it
3749171 ik ben heel tevreden met ons spel we hebben heel volwassen gespeeld maar ik ben totaal ontevreden over de strafcorners we hebben er al duizenden getraind en normaal missen we amper stops maar hier hebben we er 3 of 4 gemist dat is heel frustrerend maar we werken eraan de spelers in kwestie zijn daar natuurlijk ook ontgoocheld over maar er zijn al enkele teams die problemen hebben op dit veld om de bal te stoppen we hebben in de recente wedstrijden nu 5 punten gepakt tegen duitsland nadat we daarvoor 28 jaar op rij hadden verloren hopelijk kunnen we binnenkort ook de negatieve trend tegen andere topteams ombuigen
3749172 we hebben heel zwaar gewerkt in deze partij gewerkt als een team in de tweede helft waren we fysiek beter dan de duitsers we hebben in het begin wat geluk gehad maar in de tweede helft kenden we ook enkele keren malchance tegen spanje in de eerste wedstrijd zat alles goed vast maar bij de duitsers was het tactisch minder compact een punt gehaald uit de eerste twee wedstrijden tegen de twee zwaarste tegenstanders dat is wat we wilden
3749173 nu nog winnen van nieuw zeeland en dan hebben we misschien zelfs nog kans op de top 2 in de poule al droom ik nu misschien een beetje te veel het duel tegen nieuw zeeland wordt heel moeilijk vooral fysiek het wordt een belangrijke wedstrijd al die belgische supporters hier gaven me wel kippenvel en ook de nederlanders supporterden voor ons
3749174 dit is een geweldige prestatie in de tweede helft waren we veel beter vooral fysiek wij hadden de betere kansen het is vreemd om dat te zeggen na een wedstrijd tegen de wereldkampioen maar we zijn zelfs een beetje gefrustreerd dat we hier slechts n punt uit halen als we dit niveau kunnen aanhouden in de andere wedstrijden dan kunnen we nog een mooie prestatie neerzetten in dit toernooi we verbeteren alsmaar
3749175 how can they have my information when ive never dealt with them
3749176 the thing that concerns me is why they have my information for what purpose and how did they get it
3749177 they may have never even set foot in any of our facilities
3749178 many companies contract with us to do health fairs and flu shots say you were at scolaris during flu season to get a shot you usually fill out a form and that gets added to the database
3749179 my initial reaction was oh well just another security breach into a database
3749180 theyre getting to be really commonplace recently thats why its imperative that you keep up with your credit your name and your social security are probably in databases that you may not even know about
3749181 i think the time it took them to notify people was not that untimely given they had to do their research and find out how many people were affected
3749182 overall i think they have handled the incident ok so far
3749183 successful re entry and effective public safety are the same thing

3749194 cloudav virtualizes and parallelizes detection functionality with multiple antivirus engines significantly increasing overall protection said jahanian traditional antivirus software that resides on a personal computer checks documents and programs as they are accessed because of performance constraints and program incompatibilities only one antivirus detector is typically used at a time cloudav however can support a large number of malicious software detectors that act in parallel to analyze a single incoming file each detector operates in its own virtual machine so the technical incompatibilities and security issues are resolved oberheide said
3749195 this paper advocates a new model for malware detection on end hosts based on providing antivirus as an in cloud network service this model enables identification of malicious and unwanted software by multiple heterogeneous detection engines in parallel a technique we term n version protection this approach provides several important benefits including better detection of malicious software enhanced forensics capabilities retrospective detection and improved deployability and management to explore this idea we construct and deploy a production quality in cloud antivirus system called cloudav
3749196 cloudav includes a lightweight cross platform host agent and a network service with ten antivirus engines and two behavioral detection engines we evaluate the performance scalability and efficacy of the system using data from a real world deployment lasting more than six months and a database of 7220 malware samples covering a one year period using this dataset we find that cloudav provides 35 better detection coverage against recent threats compared to a single antivirus engine and a 98 detection rate across the full dataset we show that the average length of time to detect new threats by an antivirus engine is 48 days and that retrospective detection can greatly minimize the impact of this delay

3749294 less than a handful with higher credit ratings than those of the large australian banks
3749295 often used as an indicator of the banks marginal costs of funds
3749296 i think over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rate has down around half a per cent
3749297 that has significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3749298 that means that there is no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3749299 i am all for our companies being profitable that is part and parcel of a market economy but if you are a bank generating significant profits and the commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years those banks owe it to working australians who are under financial pressure that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3749300 speculate at this point on obviously a speculative cut by the reserve bank
3749301 obviously at that point we will assess what our average cost of funds is and obviously a cut will have some impact on that and it is a matter of assessing exactly what that cut is

3749617 we have finally reached an agreement with this eastern european coach to lead the black stars
3749618 we have offered him a two year contract which will end in august 2010
3749619 with the limited resources available to us we would like to extend a plea to the corporate world to make a donation either in kind or in cash to make this event a huge success and more importantly to create the opportunity for the youth to showcase their talents in the sporting arena
3749620 the reasons for these differences are rooted in the social political and economic contexts of each country country specific school sport organisations work tirelessly to change the context in instances where the context is not supportive or conducive to school sport and to enhance or improve school sport in those countries where the context is already conducive
3749621 to this end there is no better time to start then now and there is no better place to start with than the youth its an absolute pleasure to share some of our dreams of making a better life for all our learners giving practical effect to the ideals enshrined in our constitution the doors of learning and culture shall be open to all with you
3749622 namibia schools sport union has been doing a great job in being the reservoir from which raw talents are tapped and horned i am informed that the local government authority colleagues at the harbour town support this venture well done colleagues
3749623 in conclusion this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3749624 in the least invasive way possible since it does not require wearing any special suit or receivers using a simple video camera to film the bodys movement
3749625 which points are furthest away from the center of gravity following a path entirely within the outline
3749626 all those that require motion interaction with the computer that is from browsing through applications in an operating system like moving windows and text with hand movements to interactive aerobic video games and much more
3749627 theres some real strong potential on this team but were a ways away yet were not real smooth on offense we need to play smarter there were some good things but not necessarily the error free football im looking for
3749628 i learned from guys like laron landry glenn dorsey and ali highsmith how to approach each day and move into a leadership role i want to carry on their legacy of being great leaders
3749629 maybe if you asked me in a week i could tell you that everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3749630 we are farther along this year than we were last year i think that has a lot to do with the guys understanding what offensive line coach stacy searels wants a year ago we were still breaking in a new coach along with new players the guys have a much better understanding of how to get it done
3749631 for dirk to claim ignorance on the matter is a bit far fetched there is enough evidence and documentation to prove that conradie and his executive were much aware of the ongoing dealings with fnb and the organisers of the international friendly and to single out allies is unfair to say the least he should stand up and own up to the blunder instead of looking for scapegoats
3749632 it is very nice to win this prize and a big help for my career
3749633 more importantly this was a very interesting competition because it celebrates this kind of interdisciplinary approach and gave us junior scholars an opportunity to interact with and get feedback from established professionals
3749634 to be chosen from such a talented group of entrants is great and it was good to have a chance to get some top feedback on my work
3749635 interdisciplinary studies of the mind are becoming more and more important
3749636 encouraging young scholars like this who are truly empirically informed interdisciplinary and excited about the mind bringing them together and showing them that they can do things like this i think is incredibly important
3749637 the european science foundation is doing a very good job of supporting that it is just an exciting time to be studying the mind and a therefore a great time to get young scholars interested
3749638 one thing that we have seen here is just how much serious first author work is being done by people whose names you probably wont see in published journals for a few years yet but who are certainly going to be at the forefront of the next generation
3749639 cuando circulaba en moto por la carretera de la esclusa de vuelta de realizar unas gestiones
3749640 servir como testigo de una agresi n que su v ctima se niega a reconocer
3749641 afortunadamente cuando no se cuenta con la declaraci n de las v ctimas pues es muy habitual que las v ctimas no declaren contra sus agresores est la prueba de los testigos que han presenciado las cosas
3749642 lo que aumenta no son los casos de maltrato sino las mujeres que se atreven a denunciar
3749643 all three cities already had special projects underway aimed at e enabling certain parts of the city and were working closely with local universities to achieve this aim
3749644 but we decided to join forces along with a number of private companies to develop a set of tools aimed specifically at facilitating citizen communication
3749645 these are citizen based tools designed by citizens and for citizens but that can also be accessed by city authorities in order to improve their services
3749646 one of the concerns for administrations is that they do not want to dismantle their existing communications infrastructure our platform can be simply wrapped around the existing structure to provide an extra service layer this limits the costs involved in implementing it
3749647 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3749648 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3749649 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3749650 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3749651 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3749652 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended
3749653 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3749654 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3749655 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3749656 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3749657 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3749658 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3749659 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3749660 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3749661 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3749662 we had our first live cow birth here yesterday at 10 30 in the morning one of the fair associates came up with the idea that has been done in other locations to have live births on the fairgrounds for people to see something they would never experience anywhere else
3749663 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3749664 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3749665 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3749666 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3749667 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3749668 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3749669 i feel its better than the cfl nfl is real football
3749670 this is cfl country and everyone needs to know it
3749671 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3749672 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3749673 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3749674 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3749675 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3749676 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3749677 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3749678 your taxes may not be so bad study conventional wisdom exaggerated
3749679 de man zette onze gemeente op de economische kaart bij bouwde de bedrijvigheid in assenede stelselmatig uit en bleef in de loop der jaren de gemeente trouw nooit heeft hij overwogen om eca te verhuizen het bedrijf zal altijd een begrip blijven het was een man die een hart had voor assenede tijdens zijn leven realiseerde hij ook ruim 260 verkavelingen
3749680 keep them happy and they will do the right thing
3749681 the japanese did a study on him took him into a scientific lab and broke down all of his anatomy
3749682 it showed that the wing span is 203 centimetres and his height is 193 centimetres usually height matches arm length so hes already got this extra reach
3749683 then his shoe size is 14 where most are 12 at most and that gives him an extra 10 per cent efficiency everything about him physically is stacked in his favour
3749684 so where most people do a dolphin kick and try to kick from the ribs he can do it all the way from the chest which in this case gives him 20 efficiency thats why you see him stay under water so long and why it is so easy when he comes up
3749685 for him all that is pretty effortless and then hes got that energy to continue swimming on top of the water
3749686 when spitz did it there were maybe five or six countries that had the sort of sophisticated programs we see from all over the world today
3749687 that he has the depth and capacity to do it in so many kinds of events spitz was basically freestyle and butterfly is amazing
3749688 usually you cant breaststroke to save your life if you are a freestyler
3749689 someone from our amazing top 6 is heading home this week
3749690 mitch theo and mookie you are all safe that means that earl amberly and drew you are tonights bottom 3
3749691 canada voted and the idol who received the fewest number of votes last night and is going home is amberly
3749692 alright canada youve got a top 5 and the idol mansion has become a frat house
3749693 yeah i think overall we have probably the most interesting top 5 weve ever had and probably the best musicians of any top 5 weve ever had
3749694 well its simple the same effort and dedication you put into this you take onto the next thing when you first auditioned for canadian idol you werent thinking this was my only shot in the world so you go out and do the next thing with the same effort same desires and same passion
3749695 i think one thing we havent seen yet and that is really important in the five is true spectacle weve had great singing great interpretations of songs but i dont think weve seen anybody do something completely radically visually outrageous and i think thats important
3749696 well actually our canadian tour starts in seven days starts on the 19th in st johns newfoundland and we go all across the country so check out the website
3749697 it was kind of weird at first we were a little bit nervous because we didnt know if we could do a good job of it but after earl went through we talked to the rest of the guys it was really easy they were all really nice and it just felt comfortable it was just a good time
3749698 they are taking it for stroke and heart attack prevention and its not going to work
3749699 for none of these tests is there evidence that altering treatment is beneficial to the patient
3749700 i dont think doctors should do these tests and i dont think they should change treatments based on these tests
3749701 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3749702 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3749703 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3749704 i was thrilled to bits i watched the television all day yesterday and all day today he had two runs today in the first run he had a two second penalty and he had a brilliant second run which is why he did so well
3749705 she was absolutely thrilled and delighted for david hes been receiving his medal and has been talking to gaby roslin and hes been talking to his family
3749706 davids really far too sensible to hope for anything because he knew better than anybody that anything can happen he was focussed and he was thinking positively and he was well prepared hes spent the last four years working towards it i think hell carry on for 2012 but i dont know
3749707 i put in a good final run there and in the pressure of a big final it is the most exciting time to do it
3749708 it was a bit nerve wracking watching the guys follow i was happy i had done a good run and that was all that i could do a medal is what i have been after for the last four years
3749709 this is by far the biggest competition he has ever won he is capable of holding it together under these big conditions
3749710 i had a party at the golf club today we had several bottles of bubbly and it was very nice
3749711 were representing peterborough and we want to make peterborough proud
3749712 its going to be fun because were going to get to meet other teams like baseball teams and girls field lacrosse it will be fun to see all these different athletes
3749713 because this team since ive been playing for it hasnt made it to provincials we want to show everybody we belong there
3749714 its a different atmosphere you get that olympic feeling with opening ceremonies
3749715 you get bused back and forth to the games and you stay in a college away from your parents its exciting
3749716 we have a good chance to compete because our boys want to compete
3749717 weve pulled off victories we hadnt done before against whitby halton hills and six nations i think that builds confidence they know if they go out and work hard and outwork the other teams anything is possible
3749718 you never get to do it again so you have to do your best and hopefully come out with at least a medal
3749719 we can beat any team in the province if we come to play
3749720 seven games in three days will be rough but if we get our sleep at night we should be fine
3749721 thats why at the start of the year we went with 18 runners and two goalies were a fast team and like to move the ball and move our feet we have to have the runners to play the game we play especially with three games in one day endurance is going to have to be there
3749722 it tastes like meat and it can look like meat but we can actually change the composition of the product quite a lot so we can mask the meaty flavour
3749723 if we were all really lucky wed all live right around the corner from a place like james

3749733 this is the most important gold medal the great atmosphere here in china allowed everyone to be filled with enthusiasm and good morale
3749734 we really worked hard and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cant win a gold with two mistakes
3749735 its a disappointment totally because the fight was extremely close equal to equal two very strong teams unfortunately we had this break otherwise we would have come out the winner
3749736 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3749737 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3749738 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3749739 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3749740 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician

3749779 se ha gastado demasiado dinero en cuestiones que poco tienen que ver con las necesidades b sicas de los ciudadanos
3749780 el nuevo sistema de financiaci n que propone el ministerio debe tener como eje la poblaci n y la evoluci n presente y futura que los servicios p blicos tendr n en relaci n a esta poblaci n tanto en t rminos educativos sanitarios o sociales as como en todos los factores que inciden en la financiaci n auton mica
3749781 no es sostenible este modelo y en consecuencia tiene que llevarse a cabo un sistema de financiaci n que reduzca la banda de fluctuaci n entre las comunidades que tengan mayor financiaci n y las que tengan menos estando m s pr ximas todas
3749782 no tiene sentido que prestando las comunidades aut nomas unos servicios p blicos similares a los ciudadanos reciban una financiaci n tan dispar en t rminos per c pita
3749783 entiendo que el gobierno de la naci n se ha gastado demasiado dinero en cuestiones que poco tienen que ver con las necesidades b sicas de los ciudadanos y ese dinero que se ha gastado debe anularse e invertirlo para cubrir aspectos esenciales como la educaci n o la sanidad

3749817 ps bloggen sie ruhig weiter aber lassen sie seri se journalisten in ruhe danke
3749818 begr ndet wird das durch seine angenommene eigenschaft als einzige instanz die stets gewillt sein wird eine wiederholung des singul ren auschwitz zu verhindern als
3749819 statt den antisemitismus als folge des staatlich organisierten kapitalismus zu erkennen und den richtigen schlu zu ziehen dass nur das ende des kapitalismus inkl staaten ein ende des antisemitismus bewirken kann
3749820 dann muss ich ja echt belst betrunken gewesen sein dass ich das bis jetzt in jedem zweiten text von antideutschen zur kapitalismuskritik so verstanden hab
3749821 das antisemitismus ohne rassistische komponente nicht funktioniert ist klar aber dass es unterschiedliche ph nomene sind sollte ebenso klar sein
3749822 noch mal ganz klar im text kritisierst du dass israel seinem angenommenen zweck eben schutzraum f r juden und j dinnen zu sein nicht gerecht wird
3749823 die argumenation l uft ja darauf hinaus dass die kritik nur dann keinen bestand mehr hat wenn israel alles tut um den zweck zu erreichen also die liquidierung m glichst vieler terroristen die israelis gef hrden

3749891 if you were given the power to remake the world what would you do first
3749892 i am pleased to report that we are off to a good start in fiscal 2009 and we will be releasing first quarter earnings on august 21
3749893 our top 15 brands which represent approximately 70 of sales performed particularly well over the past two fiscal years with a compound annual growth rate of 12 driven by continued double digit increases in r amp d and marketing investment against our tightly focused brand portfolio
3749894 we launched hundreds of successful new products during the past two years one of our more successful innovations was plastic snap pot beans in the uk these single serve microwavable versions of our healthy fiber rich baked beans are doing very well in the market another successful launch was smart ones r fruit inspirations tm the first health focused frozen entree with a half serving of real fruit this line of four entrees is already on track for 40 million in sales in its first 12 months
3749895 the new plan raises our outlook in several key areas with the following annualized targets sales growth of 6 increases in consumer marketing of 8 12 operating income growth of 6 7 earnings per share growth of 8 11 and operating free cash flow of around 850 million per year
3749896 heinz continues to offer consumers great tasting and convenient foods while also giving them the health benefits that they are increasingly seeking across 1 lifestyle including products like heinz r steamfresh vegetables in australia and reduced salt and sugar beans and ketchup to promote general wellness 2 childrens nutrition where we are a category leader in the markets in which we compete and 3 weight management
3749897 combined our weight watchers r smart ones r and weight watchers r from heinz brands represent almost one billion dollars in sales and together are among the fastest growing equities in the company smart ones is rapidly becoming a lifestyle brand with an increasingly loyal consumer base and we continue to explore new meal occasions including the recent launch of smart ones morning express tm a line of four handheld breakfast sandwiches and quesadillas
3749898 smart ones torrid growth also continues in canada where it now has 7 of the top selling 11 varieties in the nutritional meals category only 18 months after the brand was first introduced
3749899 the health and wellness opportunity is large but perhaps our biggest growth opportunity is in emerging markets where we are leveraging our first mover advantage and go to market capabilities to drive accelerated growth
3749900 in fact emerging markets which grew sales 25 percent in fiscal 2008 are expected to contribute about a third of the companys total sales growth over the next two years
3749901 these markets accounted for 13 percent of total heinz sales in fiscal 2008 up from just 8 percent a few years ago with the growth trajectory i just described they are expected to reach 15 percent of sales by the end of our new plan and as much as 20 percent by 2013 this would be a significant accomplishment given the growth we are also experiencing in our developed markets
3749902 two of our newest innovations in the u s build on insights gleaned from extensive research which revealed that consumers want added convenience while still feeling like they are an integral part of the meal preparation process
3749903 ore ida r steam n mash tm potatoes and t g i fridays tm complete skillet meals satisfy both requirements
3749904 not since the days henry heinz was introducing his first 57 varieties have we been driving such a strong innovation agenda for the heinz brand globally we had a busy year of product launches for the brand in fiscal 2008 with another on tap for fiscal 2009
3749905 in australia we launched new varieties of heinz steamfresh vegetables in fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2009 we will expand steamfresh into the meals category
3749906 in the uk our heinz soup innovation pipeline resulted in record shares in fiscal 2008 and we have more new varieties planned for later this year
3749907 with a healthy balance sheet and abundant opportunities to explore in both the developed and developing world we are confident in our ability to execute value added acquisitions
3749908 the message from investors to corporates is that if we are headed for a recession they should clean up their balance sheets and prepare a financial buffer
3749909 as banks de lever non financial corporates will have to wake up to far less flexible world of credit
3749910 the market appears to have overreacted to a fall in the oil price and investors have turned a blind eye to second round effects of inflation such as rising wages
3749911 it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
3749912 while we have started to see some demand for oil curtailed in oecd economies the economic fundamentals in china and other emerging markets support oil at more than u s 100 a barrel into 2009
3749913 banks are highly unlikely to see a v shaped recovery in their share price given the uncertainties in the market
3749914 apart from the economic outlook a key question is how stringent regulators will be in setting new rules to govern banks capital ratios no one yet knows what the appropriate capital structure of the future is
3749915 all of you will receive an a in fact i have already entered your grade into the final report
3749916 that people are looking for hope people are looking for comfort when faced with uncertainty people are looking for some way to fill the emptiness in their lives people are looking to matter
3749917 watkins closing comments included the retelling of a cherokee fable that examines the internal battle that each person faces
3749918 ive seen just how hard it is sometimes for us disciples to feed the good wolf of hope compassion and joy
3749919 how hard it is for us to choose life but i come tonight to bear witness that more often than we know we do choose life and that is the part of the story that we must learn to tell

3749957 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3749958 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3749965 all our thoughts are with his family at this time
3749966 its a very sad loss and to learn of that this morning makes me deeply saddened for johns family
3749967 his death means the loss of a good friend and a good colleague and it is very upsetting for all of us here in fife that we have lost someone who has dedicated all of his adult life to serving the labour party
3749968 he was someone who i grew to both like and admire over the years because he was so committed to what he was doing
3749969 john had above all a caring attitude but he also had a very good sense of humour and that sense of humour always helped to cut through many difficult political situations
3749970 i always admire people who have got the ability for humour and john certainly did have that in abundance
3749971 you could say the 82nd airborne division in world war ii was like henry ford was to the automobile industry

3749975 we dont care if the house blows away in a storm as long as we dont lose those log books
3749976 he cant keep a checkbook but he sure can keep a log book
3749977 i did it to see why he liked it so much
3749978 and now i know because when you come down from a jump you think you can lick the world
3749979 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3749980 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3749981 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3749982 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3749983 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3749984 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3749985 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3749986 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3749987 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3749988 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3749989 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3749990 it is a sad situation in georgia and i would like to thank fifa for thinking about that and we will wait to see what fifa decide
3749991 i know that fifa will think about the calendar and for me it is important that the game will be played on september 6
3749992 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team

3749994 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it
3749995 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3749996 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3749997 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3749998 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3749999 i just keep saying to myself greatest olympian of all time over and over
