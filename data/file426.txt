4260000 a lot of people said why would you get a catcher who cant throw anybody out we wanted to get someone we knew had a reputation for working with pitchers
4260001 he cares about how we do out there i know that when i go out there im as prepared as i can be and he is too that doesnt always translate to a good game but it gives you the best chance to win
4260002 some of the pirates announcers were like what are you doing
4260003 playing baseball is fun i love milwaukee and i want to play here a lot longer
4260004 its a hundred different messages you can take from the song

4260014 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4260015 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4260016 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4260017 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4260018 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4260019 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4260020 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4260021 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4260022 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft
4260023 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4260024 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4260025 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4260026 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4260027 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4260028 the prime minister john howard had responded to the call of the indigenous women to come to the aid of them and their children
4260029 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children the defeat of the black man was absolute
4260030 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4260031 the main concern i have with what she is saying is that it actually gives a sense of no hope
4260032 every six months or so i guess theyd be in school or something and theyd leave and go to chicago or someplace
4260033 i dont have to tell them this and that because they already know im from mississippi and we had the same doctor all the time unless one died or something garys real real nice and im real real crazy about him
4260034 a medical home is essential to promote a relationship between a health care provider and a patient
4260035 there must be continuity and trust its not sufficient to just be a good diagnostician and be able to write a prescription trust is necessary for a patient to follow a treatment plan its important that patients be able to ask questions of their provider a good relationship means give and take between patient and provider to come up with a treatment plan that will be successful especially for people with chronic illness
4260036 originally meant the physical place at which the multiple components of the health record of a child with special health care needs was kept so it was one place where a child could be cared for holistically
4260037 a health care setting that provides patients with timely well organized care and enhanced access to providers
4260038 when adults have a medical home their access to needed care receipt of routine preventive screenings and management of chronic conditions improve substantially
4260039 the survey found that rates of cholesterol breast cancer and prostate screening are higher among adults who receive patient reminders when minority patients have medical homes they are just as likely as whites to receive these reminders the results suggest that all providers should take steps to create medical homes for patients community health centers and other public clinics in particular should be supported in their efforts to build medical homes for all patients
4260040 are you treated with respect given an action plan getting patient education shown how to manage your condition at home
4260041 if you want fragmented care thats what you get under existing fee for service where you pay for each visit each intervention as if its a separate thing like a widget
4260042 theres a growing crisis in primary care where fewer and fewer medical students are choosing it
4260043 its one of the lowest paid specialties medical home creates a system where doctors can care for patients the way they really want to
4260044 i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution here
4260045 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4260046 what we need is an independent forensic audit which details where the water is who controls it and what the best use of the water is
4260047 it wasnt concerned with any incriminating evidence against haneef but went to the question of his association with the guys in the uk who were suspected to have been involved in criminal conduct
4260048 all of this is damning of mr keelty and mr andrews who have both spent the last 13 months variously pretending that they had evidence incriminating dr haneef that they cannot share publicly
4260049 i had to decide whether haneef passed the character test
4260050 a person fails the character test if he has or has had an association with a person or group that i reasonably suspected was engaged in criminal conduct
4260051 my decision was based on the material provided to me by the department which in turn had come from the afp
4260052 what has happened today i believe is a landmark in australian legal history
4260053 if mr selim succeeds his damages are going to be huge arent they
4260054 and the reputations of several senior commonwealth officers are going to be completely destroyed
4260055 first of all they proposed a confidential settlement and i said no way
4260056 they have been deceiving me deceiving the public deceiving the prime minister i said i will take this much and not a cent less
4260057 a judgment for the claimant but does not involve the commonwealth conceding any of the specific allegations in the proceedings
4260058 you certainly dont hear the decoupling story where asian economies were expected to grow independently of the us like you did six months ago
4260059 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4260060 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4260061 if tomorrow president mikheil saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4260062 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4260063 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4260064 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4260065 they tend to do fairly well in volatile environments because they get reasonable transaction volumes
4260066 their derivative business has certainly fallen quite a lot in volume but in terms of the equities business we all look at the value of equities being traded and that has fallen
4260067 the actual number of trades is up over 60 per cent even in the last three months
4260068 that largely came about because weve paid out record rebates to qualifying cash equity market brokers who qualified for our rebate scheme
4260069 conversely the global deleveraging that has been occurring for the past 12 months has affected our listing activity principally initial public offerings in common with most of the other exchanges around the world
4260070 as of june the kind of money they were holding on behalf of participants was about 3 7 billion and with that cash they pay the participant roughly the cash rate on the interest they earn but they invest that money in short term bank bills so they earn a spread on it
4260071 that spread along with interest on their own cash drove 30 per cent growth in interest revenue
4260072 the operating environment that theyre in is challenging theres no question about that and theres still potential for competitive dynamics to come into their business
4260073 so there are issues on the horizon but you can take comfort from the fact that the asx is a very robust and diversified business that has has an exceptionally strong balance sheet
4260074 its an unknown quantity and thats always going to worry a management team
4260075 the one thing they can take comfort out of is if you look at whats happened in london so far where competition has come in and taken a share of the market lse volumes are actually doing much better than most of their european exchange peers
4260076 that view is based on investments we continue to make in supervision a new technology platform and new products and service innovation
4260077 by inference i dont know and the best economists dont know whether sentiment over the next 12 months is going to stay as it was or whether there will be further downturn
4260078 i note that for the first time asics recommendations to asx are presented as agreed actions this shows a concerted effort by both asic and asx to quicken their response times to emerging issues in financial markets and i welcome this
4260079 it would be a shock if the asx lost its supervisory functions after the minister welcomed the asic report on the asx
4260080 this is a clear signal that it will keep them
4260081 financial markets have experienced a significant turnaround this year and regulators have done a solid job in difficult times a well funded and transparent approach to market supervision is a critical component of a well ordered market
4260082 why not life is short life is dull life is full of pain why not do something special
4260083 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
4260084 our investment in erbitux is managed through various governance provisions in the collaboration agreement separate from the shares
4260085 hinges on how the two sides maneuver through delawares tricky takeover rules which are designed to force management to seek the highest price when they put the company up for sale without driving off bidders that are willing to lay out real cash
4260086 the only thing hedge funds are hedging these days are profits
4260087 its a good thing the clear channel buyout closed today now nobody has to jump
4260088 many analysts and shareholders said dumping most of the brokerages collateralized debt obligations for 22 cents on the dollar was nasty but necessary and could show other wall street firms and commercial banks a way to finally escape the worst of their securities and loans
4260089 we have great growing business there but the more i read about investments in russia the less i like the feel of it the more successful wed be the more vulnerable wed be to have it stolen from us so there we sell now

4260097 it was disappointing to record a loss in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of income the loss was attributable to the downtime of the mill at montana tunnels as a direct result of the previously announced ball mill shell failure due to cracking which occurred on april 27 2008 coupled with lower lead and zinc prices the team at our montana tunnels mine is to be congratulated in completing a tremendous job of repair on the mill enabling us to get back into production within a three week period i am happy to report that since the repair the mill has been performing well at black fox we are continuing to make progress towards production in 2009 some other noteworthy recent developments more fully described below are a the purchase of the stock mill complex to process ore from our black fox project b the ordering of a new regrind ball mill for upgrading the recently purchased stock mill c the purchase of five haul trucks for use at black fox and d the recent successful equity raise i anticipate that gbm mec ltd our mill consultants will complete the study on upgrading the stock mill throughput from its current design of 1 100 tonnes per day up to 1 500 tonnes per day by the end of september 2008 also next week we expect to file the black fox project mine closure plan with the ministry of northern development and mines in ontario which we anticipate will enable us to commence alluvial till overburden removal in early october 2008

4260099 this review of eeyes retina security management appliance is a testament to our continued commitment to providing the best security and threat management products at the best prices with true ease of use and strong support
4260100 the review highlights eeyes ability to deliver superb security assessment capability in a way that is both intuitive and valuable
4260101 prometic maintains its 2008 revenue guidance for its protein technologies division with ebitda being positive in 2008 and greater than 15 m for 2009 we expect a strong second half of 2008 pursuant to the delivery on orders in hand execution on agreements the imminent signing of additional agreements as disclosed earlier this month as well as a decrease in certain non recurring payments and targeted cost reduction measures
4260102 a positive trend is seen when in the second quarter alone well over 5 m worth of orders for prometics products and services were secured with delivery scheduled over the third and fourth quarters of 2008 these orders result directly from the increased demand by existing clients for prometics products as well as the adoption of these products by new clients
4260103 additionally we anticipate a reduction of approximately 4 m in expenditures for the second half of 2008 this includes decreases in research expenses relating to projects having reached commercial stage and certain non recurring payments costs savings are expected to exceed 8 m in 2009
4260104 the combination of revenue growth and costs savings will have a significant impact on our financial position as early as the second half of 2008
4260105 the scale up for projected adoption of the p capt filter the increasing demand for our prion capture products as well as the growing number and size of orders for bioseparation materials are some of the key elements giving momentum to this evolution and growth
4260106 in addition to our base legacy customers we expect to grow revenue through the acquisition plan and distribution of fonix speech technologies for the iphone
4260107 key to the companys restructure plan is distribution of our speech technologies on mobile devices such as iphone broad based implementation of fonix speech in video games on multiple game platforms and significant growth through acquisition of established value added companies in asia revenues are expected to grow as we achieve market penetration on mobile devices and game platforms
4260108 we are very pleased with the 2nd quarter financial results our strong financial performance reflects implementation of our growth strategies in a favorable market environment as china embraces more energy efficient products smartheat stands to benefit greatly from chinas green movement towards clean environment as our efficient energy saving products reduce heat energy use by as much as 50 we look forward to continued execution of our growth plan as we enter two of smartheats strongest quarters
4260109 clearly our second quarter financial results were overshadowed by the inventory and receivable write downs taken during this period accounting adjustments of this type are always painful and generally unpopular nonetheless it is the responsibility of management to provide a dispassionate and conservative valuation of the companys assets in an ever changing market environment it is worth noting that without these write downs both our core operating entities world jet and hamilton aerospace would have shown quarter to quarter growth in both revenue and pre tax income our top priority at this time is to return our aircraft trading business segment to profitability the recent changes to our board management and corporate governance are the most visible of the numerous steps we are taking to improve our aircraft trading operations

4260122 the most predominant finding is that is that these particular industries are predominantly male oriented and unfortunately some of the key risk factors that are associated with those occupations have to do with for example failing to seek help

4260137 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
4260138 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
4260139 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition
4260140 the gaea universe offers a realism and depth beyond the usual gaming conventions

4260209 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4260210 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4260211 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4260212 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4260213 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4260214 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4260215 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4260216 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4260217 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4260218 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4260219 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4260220 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4260221 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4260222 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4260223 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4260224 ya no se necesita esperar a que llueva para ver los tobillos de las muchachas ahora usan minifaldas ombligueras mayones calzas y biquinis las revistas y los peri dicos muestran como si fuera la cosa m s natural mujeres sin ropa y no se diga el cine y la televisi n ya no hay pudor
4260225 ser objeto sexual para los mirones que las rodean viol ndolas con la imaginci n
4260226 el pudor es reservar para el ser amado esos incentivos sensitivos y placenteros que llevan a tener hijos el pudor se aprende en el hogar el pudor tambi n es un valor que se debe ense ar a los ni os no s lo a las ni as

4260228 what this clause effectively says is that roads airports and power stations are more important than peoples health
4260229 everybody has a right to enjoy their own home without being disturbed by pollution such as noise dust smells or artificial light and councils will do everything they can to make sure this right is upheld
4260230 by exempting major infrastructure projects from nuisance laws the government is tying the hands of councils leaving them unable to respond to the legitimate concerns of local people
4260231 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberan a alimentaria
4260232 el objetivo primordial era unir las luchas de los ltimos a os en la argentina tener a la v a campesina sudamericana en argentina para dar un paso m s en la visibilidad de sus luchas
4260233 con toda la discusi n que se dio sobre el modelo agropecuario en los ltimos meses era necesario hacerlo con fuerza as nace la idea de un foro abierto que pudiera dar testimonio de la v a campesina que es totalmente diferente antag nica a la otra v a del campo entre comillas que apareci en estos meses

4260262 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4260263 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around

4260266 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information

4260272 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4260273 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4260274 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture
4260275 in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights
4260276 welcome olympic games with joyfulness and construct a harmonious society
4260277 about protesting i think chinese people have experienced very little of this
4260278 i think foreigners might have more protests i think chinese people do not have the awareness yet we dont know what there is to protest about

4260290 the current credit scenario has made it harder to break ground on new hotel projects we have seen a bubble of projects forming in the final planning stage over the course of the year
4260291 it is still unclear if those projects will be built or if they will be abandoned
4260292 in a difficult demand environment a slowdown in the mid to long term construction pipeline will pay dividends for the hotel industry in 2009 and 2010 it now seems clear the industry will avoid the huge supply surge that accompanied the last two building cycles

4260303 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre he said
4260304 its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4260305 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft she said
4260306 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour

4260315 we took the critique to heart that overlord was not evil enough with some of the choices offered as between good and evil

4260318 i was never able to develop a coherent explanation for the thing as to how it related to everything else that was going on
4260319 some of the descriptions that the air force provided made no sense
4260320 i assume that that is what happened in the sense that they were talking about this thing doing offensive cyber attacks the nsa national security agency already does that they were talking about defending the domestic information infrastructure well the commerce department and fbi have been doing that for 15 years
4260321 cyber command was completely redundant we have boatloads of protection in cyberspace two boatloads of it everything they were talking about doing was being done by someone else
4260322 i think this is about eliminating redundancy between armed forces branches more than anything else the navy has long had a well regarded cyber warfare group also the intelligence services in particular the nsa have always excelled here i am sure they are being put to good use both in georgia and in china for the olympics

4260332 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4260333 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4260334 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4260335 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time

4260337 de kerndoelstelling van de structuurvisie is dat we een vitale stad willen met goede voorzieningen om vitaal te blijven heb je massa nodig er is berekend dat we moeten doorgroeien naar een inwonertal van 505 000
4260338 als we besluiten om meer eengezinswoningen te bouwen dan trekt de middengroep weer terug in de stad

4260342 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4260343 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4260344 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on
4260345 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4260346 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4260347 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4260348 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4260349 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4260350 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not

4260386 recuerdo que me mandaron con otros m s y un par de discos anduvimos recorriendo todo la ciudad hasta que llegamos al sal n pueyrred n pegamos buena onda y nos dieron una fecha imposible de olvidarla

4260395 e mail is more of a commodity and now a lot more things are being outsourced
4260396 and i think a lot of the solutions have been getting better they are more professional and more of the providers better understand the customer relationship and how to manage it
4260397 all companies are starting to analyze the costs and trade offs of hosting
4260398 the real trick is going to be which provider can reliably offer this on a worldwide basis companies dont want different deals with different providers in different countries and then try to tie the whole thing together

4260404 famous for getting lost during the paris dakar motor rally and making his mother cry in public notorious for shamelessly exploiting her name to further dodgy business ventures renowned for his rudeness arrogance and pomposity and no stranger to controversy but none of his previous dubious escapades can compare with his reckless involvement in an ill fated plot to oust the offal loving president of equatorial guinea
4260405 i have no involvement in any alleged coup in equatorial guinea and i reject totally all suggestions to the contrary
4260406 not just an investor he came on board completely and became part of the management team
4260407 if involvement known rest of us and project likely to be screwed as a side issue to people screwing him would particularly add to a campaign post event to remove us
4260408 we should expect bad behaviour disloyalty rampant individual greed irrational behaviour kids in toyshop type back stabbing and similar ungentlemanly activities

4260410 wir haben die warnschilder nicht verstanden sie waren auf rum nisch
4260411 es war der reinste horror der b r zerfetzte das ganze zelt ich habe um hilfe geschrien es passierte alles so schnell dann war der riesige b r direkt ber mir
4260412 ich habe ein riesengl ck gehabt das h tte noch viel schlimmer enden k nnen
4260413 ich bin total aufgeregt aber ich gebe von anfang an richtig stoff
4260414 im urlaub hat mir mein vater mein erstes motorrad gekauft
4260415 ich musste mein leben komplett umstellen weil ich fast alle zwei wochen nach spanien fliege
4260416 jeden tag stelle ich mir vor auf dem treppchen zu stehen das ist meine motivation
4260417 ich verfolge alle seine k mpfe im boxen braucht wladimir niemanden zu f rchten
4260418 wenn er zeit hat w rde ich gerne mit ihm aufs wasser und testen wer am l ngsten kann
4260419 wenn man in den himmel schie t ist dort oben eine totale stille
4260420 du schaust aufs meer und h rst f r ein paar sekunden absolut nichts unglaublich beim kiten erf llt sich der traum vom fliegen
4260421 ich habe anw lte kontaktiert wir bereiten jetzt zusammen die ganzen papiere vor
4260422 wir schreiben jetzt alle spieler der liga und der nationalmannschaft an
4260423 mit sven felski von den eisb ren und tino boos aus hannover habe ich schon gesprochen
4260424 viele unserer jungs werden doch v llig alleingelassen das du beispielsweise als del spieler 25 000 euro wegen eines dopingvergehens zahlen musst wissen viele nicht wir sagen jetzt bescheid wollen zuk nftig ansprechpartner ratgeber und zur not auch anwalt gegen ber verb nden und vereinen f r sie sein angst muss aber keiner vor uns haben
4260425 die araber bieten ein bisschen mehr und der spieler w rde besser bezahlt hertha dagegen will 8 mio euro in raten zahlen bei den arabern gibt es weniger hindernisse
4260426 ich wollte nach europa aber diese offerten sind zu gut
4260427 wir haben ein gutes team und eine weitere chance vier titel zu gewinnen
4260428 das ist deprimierend f r jefferson und die ganze mannschaft doch da m ssen wir durch jammern hilft uns nicht
4260429 schei e er war schon sehr gut drauf aber unser kader ist stark genug
4260430 pers nlich w nsche ich dem lukas alles gute aber die bayern haben sich ja da klar ge u ert und wir wollen doch auch nicht dass irgendwann mal die stimmung der bayern fans gegen podolski kippt
4260431 frau barth es geht doch gar nicht um einen sponsor lukas hat einen vertrag bis 2010 bei bayern m nchen den m ssen wir respektieren
4260432 aber wenn wir jetzt schon wieder vom internationalen gesch ft reden dann hei t es gleich der daum dreht schon wieder durch wir m ssen erst mal alle kr fte b ndeln um die bundesliga zu erhalten dann k nnen wir die weiteren ziele angehen wir wissen was wir zu tun haben und wenn wir mal eine positive serie hinlegen dann d rfen wir auch nicht gleich abheben wir wissen ja wie das nach dem letzten aufstieg war
4260433 wo steht der fc in f nf jahren herr daum
4260434 entscheidend ist wo der fc n chste saison steht es geht um einen dauerhaften bundesliga platz vielleicht k nnen wir in der winterpause schon den n chsten schritt planen es w re jetzt jedoch v llig fahrl ssig ber die zukunft zu sprechen ich kann nur sagen bleibt alle auf dem teppich wir sprechen aber da mit den fans eine gemeinsame sprache ich wei dass uns viele f r einen abstiegskandidaten halten und keiner mit uns rechnet aber das gibt uns eine ungemeine kraft
4260435 tim hat in der vergangenen saison regelm ig in der champions league gespielt und sich seine chance verdient
4260436 es war schon ein bisschen berraschend ich freue mich sehr werde gas geben ich sehe es als lohn f r meine leistungen ich will mich dort gut pr sentieren einen guten trainingseindruck hinterlassen
4260437 was nicht geht ist dass er sich ber andere torwarte u ert das ist respektlos
4260438 gut dass der bundestrainer nicht nur kuscher einl dt sondern nach leistung geht
4260439 er hat sich fu ballerisch weiterentwickelt bringt die klasse f r die nationalelf mit auf dieses ziel haben wir hintrainiert
4260440 naheliegend dass zu beginn robert enke im tor stehen wird
4260441 ich bin schon sehr traurig ich war ja sehr lange in deutschland es war eine sch ne zeit ich w re gerne noch l nger geblieben
4260442 flamengo ist mein lieblingsverein in brasilien und das angebot war einfach zu gut die lange laufzeit bis 2010 d red und die sicherheit f r die zukunft war ausschlaggebend
4260443 der sch nste moment war die r ckkehr nach deutschland aus der t rkei da habe ich mich wahnsinnig gefreut wieder da zu sein sportlich war mein bestes spiel mit hertha ausgerechnet in wolfsburg als ich beim 3 2 alle drei tore gemacht habe und mein 50 meter tor gegen freiburg war nat rlich ein highlight
4260444 sie sprechen flie end portugiesisch nur beim schreiben wird es schwierig f r sie aber sie werden wohl in rio auf eine deutsche schule gehen sie sollen die deutsche sprache beibehalten
4260445 eine r ckkehr ist nicht ausgeschlossen bei z roberto war es ja auch so dass er noch st rker zu bayern zur ckgekehrt ist ich werde deutschland berlin und wolfsburg immer im herzen tragen mindestens einmal pro jahr zu besuch kommen
4260446 die freiheit das leben ohne angst in brasilien ist es viel gef hrlicher es gibt viele entf hrungen man sollte da nicht mit dicker uhr auf der stra e rumlaufen
4260447 ich freue mich auf sonne und strand werde sicher auch mal ausgehen rio ist da sicher nochmal ein anderes pflaster als wolfsburg oder berlin aber ich bin alt genug um zu wissen was wichtig ist ich brauche das party leben nicht mehr so und in meinem alter muss man ja auch mehr auf den k rper achten
4260448 ich freue mich dass ich der mannschaft mit zwei toren helfen konnte ebert hat mich toll bedient es war ein wichtiger schritt zum erreichen der hauptrunde im uefa cup
4260449 mit dem ergebnis muss man zufrieden sein dass war die pflicht teilweise war es mir aber zu schlampig wir h tten deutlicher gewinnen k nnen es sieht im moment nur manchmal nach fu ball aus aber ebert hat mir sehr gut gefallen
4260450 wenn bayern nicht meister wird ist das eine entt uschung
4260451 nat rlich auf j rgen klinsmann er ist f r die bundesliga was besonderes aber ich freu mich auch auf die drei aufsteiger k ln gladbach das ist tradition das zieht die leute an und hoffenheim es ist gut was dort entsteht
4260452 wenn bayern nicht meister wird ist das automatisch eine entt uschung ein weiteres ziel wird sein dass bayern sich international anders positioniert
4260453 sie m ssen wieder ein w rtchen mitreden in der champions league also die gruppenphase berstehen und dann schauen was geht
4260454 nein ganz bestimmt nicht es ist gut dass bei einem so hervorragend gef hrten verein wie dem fc bayern neue reizpunkte gesetzt werden
4260455 es macht absolut sinn dass die spieler ber das training hinaus auf dem klub gel nde bleiben und sich mit ihrer arbeit befassen da hinkt die bundesliga noch immer jahre hinterher im internationalen vergleich
4260456 letzten samstag da ging es um die nominierung f r das l nderspiel
4260457 er macht einen guten eindruck wenn das so weiter geht wird er sich irgendwann eine chance erhalten
4260458 wir haben die bef rchtete schienbeinkopf fraktur mit gelenk beteiligung festgestellt
4260459 das ist tragisch damit m ssen wir wohl die gesamte hinrunde auf pommes verzichten
4260460 wir wollen in der neuen saison in allen drei wettbewerben nach ganz oben um dieses ziel zu erreichen brauchen wir aber eigentlich ein komplettes team
4260461 mir ist es eigentlich egal ob ich operiert werden muss oder nicht ausheilen muss der knochen so oder so
4260462 pommes ist ein guter freund von mir f r ihn tuts mir pers nlich sehr leid
4260463 ich w nsche pommes schnelle genesung und hoffe dass ich so gut wie m glich f r ihn in die bresche springen kann
4260464 mein finger tat mir die ganze zeit so unendlich weh ich hatte schmerzen ohne ende
4260465 ich habe mich nur durchgebissen ich wollte in der ffentlichkeit nichts sagen damit es nicht so aussieht dass ich eine ausrede suche
4260466 ich glaube er hat zu sehr auf den schmerz geachtet deshalb wurde seine koordination zwischen kopf und k rper gest rt dann kracht es auch bei minimalen fehlern
4260467 ich sa in der halle als ich ihn auf der videoleinwand gro sah tat es auch mir weh wir wollen hoffen dass es nichts richtig ernstes ist
4260468 ich bin schon sehr traurig ich war ja sehr lange in deutschland es war eine sehr sch ne zeit ich w re gerne noch l nger geblieben
4260469 flamengo ist mein lieblingsverein in brasilien und das angebot war einfach zu gut die lange laufzeit bis 2010 d red und die sicherheit f r die zukunft war ausschlaggebend
4260470 der sch nste moment war die r ckkehr nach deutschland aus der t rkei da habe ich mich wahnsinnig gefreut wieder da zu sein sportlich war mein bestes spiel mit hertha ausgerechnet in wolfsburg als ich beim 3 2 alle drei tore gemacht habe und mein 50 meter tor gegen freiburg war nat rlich auch ein highlight
4260471 ich bin sehr stolz dass ich beim nicht abstieg geholfen habe und letzte saison beim einzug in den uefa cup schade dass ich da jetzt nicht mehr spiele
4260472 sie sprechen flie end portugiesisch nur beim schreiben wird es schwierig f r sie aber sie werden wohl in rio auf eine deutsche schule gehen sie sollen die deutsche sprache beibehalten damit sie f r die zukunft alle m glichkeiten haben
4260473 ich wei nicht was die zukunft bringt eine r ckkehr ist sicher nicht ausgeschlossen bei z roberto war es ja auch so dass er noch st rker zu bayern zur ckgekehrt ist ich werde deutschland berlin und wolfsburg auf jeden fall immer im herzen tragen und wenn es geht will ich mindestens einmal pro jahr zu besuch kommen
4260474 die freiheit das leben ohne angst in brasilien ist es viel gef hrlicher es gibt viele entf hrungen man sollte da nicht mit dicker uhr auf der stra e rumlaufen
4260475 ich kenne rio ja gar nicht bin sehr gespannt darauf ich freue mich nat rlich auf sonne und strand werde sicher auch mal ausgehen rio ist da sicher nochmal ein anderes pflaster als wolfsburg oder berlin aber ich bin alt genug um zu wissen was wichtig ist ich brauche das party leben nicht mehr so und in meinem alter muss man ja auch mehr auf den k rper achten

4260478 bereits im mai holten sie die rzte zum ersten mal zur chemotherapie
4260479 zurzeit ist sie wieder zur behandlung in der klinik und es wird nicht die letzte sein es sieht nicht gut aus
4260480 sie sagte mir j ngst ich habe ein leben f r zehn gelebt dabei lachte sie sogar sie ist eine k mpferin
4260481 sie will unbedingt zur ck nach celina wenn die reihe der chemotherapien abgeschlossen ist
4260482 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam
4260483 dass alle russischen truppen die in den vergangenen tagen nach georgien marschiert sind das land wieder verlassen
4260484 alle zeichen deuten darauf hin dass wir vor einem neuen kalten krieg stehen
4260485 das ziel ist es die sowjetunion wiederherzustellen wenn auch nicht in den alten grenzen

4260490 si pu affrontare in vari modi dico leggere una raccolta di testi poetici si pu praticare la cosiddetta full immersion iniziare dal primo verso cio e poi via fino allultimo per lasciarsene trascinare come se dovessimo essere noi a scoprire da soli il senso dellinsieme quasi che lautore non avesse voluto o potuto consigliarci un percorso va bene anche cos certo oppure pu darsi che lautore sia stato per cos dire pi cortese e che ci abbia lasciato qualche indizio qualche chiave di lettura che ci permetta di affrontare il viaggio tra i suoi versi con pi agio ecco a me piace accettare le indicazioni di chi scrive specialmente quando sono sommessi suggerimenti orme leggere da scoprire magari sapendosi porre nellangolazione giusta per vederle lelemento di un paradigma indiziario che suggerendo una ricerca apre un dialogo silenzioso tra lettore e autore un ludus cio un gioco stimolante per la mente e forse anche per il cuore e il caso di questa raccolta di katia zattoni il suo bucare la polvere infatti si articola in tre sezioni ognuna col suo titolo particolare anzi coi suoi titoli visto che ognuna di loro ne ha uno in italiano e uno in inglese ma guarda si dir una traduzione un po inutile magari una nuova manifestazione della solita anglomania di noi provinciali italioti cos ci sentiamo pi moderni pi trendy poich come direbbe un seccatore docti sumus invece a no non si tratta infatti di traduzioni ch for living non si traduce affatto intorno alla realt n for loving dentro il sogno n tanto meno allora non sar questo gi un primo indizio la prima sommessa indicazione di un percorso che lautrice ci suggerisce in questa discrasia tra i titoli italiani e inglesi si potrebbe aprire un varco lindicazione di quella angolazione di cui ho parlato poco sopra quella cio che permette di vedere le tracce leggere che lautrice ci ha lasciato e quindi di entrare in colloquio con lei

4260500 die deutsche wirtschaft ist nicht auf rezessionskurs die konjunktur wird sich zwar merklich abschw chen aber nicht einbrechen die wachstumsrate in diesem jahr d rfte bei etwa 2 prozent liegen im n chsten jahr k nnte sie sich allerdings halbieren die positive entwicklung am arbeitsmarkt h lt in diesem jahr noch an
4260501 durch die konjunkturabschw chung entstehen weniger neue arbeitspl tze der hohe inflationsdruck l sst aber nach die teuerungsrate wird zur ckgehen und nicht auf dem derzeit hohen niveau bleiben
4260502 die deutsche wirtschaft ist heute deutlich besser aufgestellt und robuster als beim letzten abschwung 2001 das liegt an der deutlichen verbesserung der wettbewerbsf higkeit z b durch die vern nftige lohnpolitik die steuerreformen und die reformen am arbeitsmarkt auch der ffentliche haushalt ist in einer deutlich solideren verfassung

4260527 dream last night living with maayan in an apartment sleeping in a bed in the kitchen which is stuffed with canned good and packaged foods there is a sink at the far wall and cabinets surrounding it between which is a narrow window maayan is standing at it outside an unreal vivid sky of clouds and dark purple is swirling together being sucked out of sight around a single point directly over the point of the empire state building birds mostly small gulls are rushing in enormous dense flocks past the window she seems barely to notice when some of them try to swoop in all the while she talks about how nice the apartment is i comment on the strange occurrence of the disappearing clouds
4260528 the students have done everything they need to do and more and still they dont have their free speech rights
4260529 matt millen has been one of the worst general managers in the game over his tenure
4260530 greenville now thats a great city with beautiful scenery it is very progressive too the leaders there know what they are doing
4260531 people in greenville obviously have a good work ethic and know how to get things done
4260532 a mother never stops worrying about her kids feeling responsible for her kids taking care of her kids
4260533 i know i can fix this just let me figure it out
4260534 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4260535 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4260536 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4260537 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4260538 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4260539 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4260540 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4260541 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4260542 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4260543 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4260544 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4260545 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4260546 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4260547 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4260548 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4260549 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4260550 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4260551 but now i am six im as clever as clever
4260552 recently the congress passed with my support important legislation that expands the education benefits for our returning service members
4260553 mom youre not nearly as controlling as you used to be
4260554 what if im not right what if in the greater cosmic scheme of things my perspective turns out to be skewed what if i tossed in my pebble of control and opinion and the widening ripples serve to create a different wave in the unfolding river of life
4260555 ill work like hell on what i believe in but i take no responsibility for the results
4260556 how could this happen what purpose would explain schools being the way they are
4260557 it is allowed but we have to concentrate on the reading examination
4260558 i will demonstrate to you that you dont know how to read even though your test score says that you know how to read better than anybody in the school
4260559 i will give you an open book test on the first 20 pages of that book and i will be very surprised if anyone in here passes the test
4260560 give us double rations because these other people arent going to come
4260561 why did the army unit get double rations as the book opens
4260562 if i solve that problem and take my time and resources doing it what exactly am i losing overall
4260563 why do we ring bells and you have to drop what youre doing
4260564 because you have to because thats the rules thats the law and if you dont want to get into trouble get moving
4260565 these are of prime importance concentrate on these things do these things
4260566 look the only way i can give your kids significant responsibility under the law is by giving them a volunteer assignment so i cant accept anyone into the program who wont do that my main purpose in doing this is to give kids significant primary responsibility so they will never be assigned in teams of 50 where they can hang out and perpetuate the culture of youth theyre going to be on their own or at best in teams of two or three and theyll have something real to do where if they fail in doing it damage will occur once they pass that screen im going to tell you that in ten years with the strangest eclectic group of children i never had a single occasion when a kids disappointed me
4260567 this needs to be done im going to do that
4260568 how many views has this blog had since it was created on march 30 2008
4260569 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year

4260582 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve

4260608 dont think of your career as being about balance within each phase but across phases when you think about having it all worked out within one phase it gets very stressful you look for that day of perfect balance and it just never exists i say think of your career in phases and be patient because you never know what phase is coming

4260626 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
4260627 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
4260628 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4260629 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
4260630 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4260631 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4260632 lekan has a broad knowledge of the rhythms that really are the basis for the music we play in america west african rhythms that have been there for centuries
4260633 its interesting to bring these two streams back together again the west african approach to rhythm together with how we are feeling about it as jazz musicians
4260634 it was fascinating to me to be marrying some very unusual rhythms with these standard songs
4260635 i have always placed more emphasis on rhythm than on melody and harmony because the tendency in western music is to downplay the importance of rhythm
4260636 if i did standards on every album that i did id run out of ideas its kind of a dead end situation
4260637 its great music yeah but you have to start to experiment find your own voice and its very difficult to do that if youre doing standards constantly one of the most important components of jazz is that it embraces tradition but at the same time it has to move forward
4260638 her own take on standards in a very contemporary manner
4260639 i think she brings the freshest take on standards of any artist ive heard
4260640 she has a very distinctive sound and style and very unusual arrangements to do an album like this and and reinvent herself without even trying is amazing her style is absolutely her own nothing borrowed about it
4260641 i think the real story here is what the musicians are doing
4260642 although i might be singing in a fairly conservative fashion at least for the first verse the musicians are doing some wild stuff from the get go
4260643 i love to get the musicians out of a certain comfort thing that they have to get them out of new york city and into a place thats just totally different
4260644 jackson is the biggest city in mississippi but youre not that far removed from a very strong sense of rural mississippi
4260645 it is so much more relaxed sometimes the tape is rolling and they dont even realize it so you are able to capture those moments that are unguarded
4260646 i hope to be a conduit to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between west african culture particularly the yoruba and how much that has impacted who we are in the south particularly in mississippi and louisiana
4260647 i think theres so much we have to learn about our culture and who we were before we came here i think that empowers you and gives you a solid sense of identity one thing we need in order to strengthen ourselves and our community is to begin to draw those connections and to celebrate that
4260648 other technologies that have passed the trigger where they start to be interesting to businesses include 3d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots said gartner vice president jackie fenn the author of the report we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of application such as using 3d printers to dramatically change the supply chain by creating products and replacement parts at the point of need
4260649 although web 2 0 is now entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
4260650 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4260651 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4260652 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4260653 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time

4260656 we dont know what sort of evil befell her if any frankly
4260657 but weve learned through hard work and over time we can solve those cases if we do the right things
4260658 confession is admitting that youre guilty before god and agreeing that a penalty is deserved
4260659 they confiscated her phone and from there when they viewed the phone they saw some things that were kind of odd
4260660 the texts in themselves were bad enough that this individual a 34 year old man is texting 13 and 14 year old girls
4260661 but then he did send photographs of his private parts his genitals to one of the victims at that point youre really stepping out of bounds
4260662 my wife says i treat them better than i treat her
4260663 seventy mile an hour winds dont do pumpkins any good
4260664 but for me getting a personal best is going to be an uphill battle
4260665 we plan on making a much better showing next year
4260666 all i want now is to finish my education i want to be a lawyer i want to defend oppressed people i want to be an example for all the other girls
4260667 they kept whispering in my ear to ask why i wasnt smiling i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married i pleaded with them to help me escape but no one saw anything wrong in what was happening i begged my husband not to marry me but he told me i had no choice
4260668 it was disgusting awful i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender inside it killed me inside life became meaningless i had my childhood taken away and missed out on all my teenage years sometimes i still wonder if its worth trying to have a future many days im not at all sure it is
4260669 she will talk to her ajak2 and she left me alone sometimes i wonder if she is my best friend
4260670 hi we got a call from the city and they brought over a sample of the stuff that was coming out of your pipes
4260671 heres the thing whereas its a straightforward intellectual exercise to add more stuff to braid in terms of emotion and contemplation the body has reached its natural size
4260672 adding more limbs would just be wrong the thing to do is just make the next game and have it be really good
4260673 now what are you guys going to rewrite canola again with qt
4260674 well we just dont understand it here you are a guy who likes to take care of himself you have a dog you have a baseball glove and a gym dog and youre down here buying heroin
4260675 detailed and informative website providing advice on how to switch
4260676 the important thing is not the official cash rate but what the level of interest borrowers are paying
4260677 our view is that their implementation of the account switching package is really not good enough
4260678 industry has followed the path of least resistance to get in place a package that meets the treasurers requirements with the least amount of effort possible
4260679 come november there is going to be this package in place and it does mean multiple physical trips to the banks and no guarantee that all your direct debits will be switched you the customer still bear all of the risk
4260680 if the government doesnt follow through on that report and actually do something that account switching package has no teeth
4260681 choice warmly welcomed our package in february and have been participating in constructive discussions since then so their comments are somewhat surprising
4260682 we would expect choice to look favourably on any attempts by the government to help families make the banking system work for them not against them which is what our initiatives will do
4260683 they were out of barbeque i got onion n garlic
4260684 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft
4260685 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the thursday inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in petrol
4260686 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market
4260687 trying to figure out why someone would want to do this to kimberly a loving mother a loving friend a loving sister who doesnt bother anybody just to stay to herself and work hard to take care of her kids
4260688 we dont believe she was the reason for the shootings
4260689 two different guns were used we found two different casings one could have been from a car in the parking lot area and one was pretty close to the window
4260690 there are four children now without their mom she was always there for her children please if you know anything just please call and tell someone something
4260691 yes shabu here in butuan city and some parts of caraga region is now sold at p13 000 00 per gram this is because of the very tight guarding against incoming of supplies by our men and other law enforcement groups
4260692 the aussie and other currencies couldnt rally on the back of it
4260693 i suspect the market thinks us rates could theoretically go up quicker
4260694 were underestimating the size of the short us dollar positioning
4260695 the us dollar has been in decline for the past six years and maybe the australian dollar has been overvalued for the past six to 12 months
4260696 fair use is a means to allow people to comment on a pre existing work not a means to allow someone to take a pre existing work and recreate it into their own work
4260697 what you cant do is substitute someone elses creativity for your own
4260698 we are committed to that being rolled out so that every single bus in our fleet will have a bike rack on the front of it and so that means retrofitting some and buying new ones with them already on it
4260699 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4260700 in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and to try to drive the play
4260701 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4260702 we had to believe that we could get a result we had to match the effort and tonight it was enough
4260703 i think at the start of the match they didnt expect us to come out and take it to them with the energy and effort that we showed
4260704 we expected them to come back at out ground and not underestimate but well have out fans behind us and we believe we can do it
4260705 without the joseph venezias of the world the enterprise of which he was a part would in fact crumble
4260706 look can we talk there been something i want to ask but i dont want to upset you
4260707 its been great talking with you you and i would really enjoy continuing our but i promised myself i would meet lots of people here tonight can i call you and plan to get together when we have more time to talk
4260708 leafing through the guardian this week i have been gripped by extracts from a new book by polly toynbee and david walker unjust rewards in which the two guardian stalwarts interview loads of rich people and discover that theyre not very nice who would have thought its lucky we have the guardian to get to the nub of things for us with its unique blend of snobbery bitterness jealousy and thwarted ambition cobbled together with the tawdry and risible clich s its readers have thrilled to for years
4260709 every year we set out with the same expectations lets go for the acc championship lets try and be the best in our great conference if we manage that task well put ourselves in great position for the ncaa tournament
4260710 last year i was extremely proud of this group we gave ourselves a great chance to win the accs and we made it back to the final four they were a young squad as far as experience and really managed to pull together when it counted the most that is what this program has been built upon that character
4260711 this years squad will have more depth more experience and stronger unity i believe we will have a tremendous senior class with some key veteran juniors leading the way as well
4260712 i think we learned some lessons in 2007 i think we grew in respect to those experiences
4260713 you have two choices in those situations you can fall or grow we grew
4260714 this years squad will show that we have chosen some new standards that will bring unity to the team we have a more cohesive supporting cast around the elected captains based on last years trials you will see a stronger set of character and morals rising i think we have a tremendous senior class and have the strengths to really work well off one another
4260715 i think that overall we are in a great position because as much as we got done last year there was still a feeling of loss because there were some things that showed potential but were untapped
4260716 if we can keep ourselves organized and poised i believe we can be extremely threatening this season
4260717 the strength of our front line is a reflection of the defensive presence and dynamic attack of kim and hilary
4260718 raisa is a great ball handler and is extremely dynamic
4260719 she is extremely threatening and we look for her to help generate our offense
4260720 when i saw lauren as a junior i thought she could play at this level she is a huge asset for us
4260721 adelaide has great international experience and we look forward to her contributions this season
4260722 crystal is going to be challenged by julia she has shown that she posses the needed qualities to push crystal
4260723 with julia it will come down to her showing us she has enough experience and game savvy to play
4260724 our first five matches could be against top ten teams with iowa michigan james madison carolina and duke i think that is great testing ground to see exactly where we are
4260725 the trip to northwestern gives us the chance to play two additional big ten opponents
4260726 the big ten is filled with quality opponents i believe this is one of the toughest conferences
4260727 no matter how clean the hospital is no matter how diligently we work we still want to stay on top of making sure we do the best we can to protect you while youre in the hospital and out of the hospital
4260728 we look for trends to see if theres something in our community or anywhere in our hospital which would cause the spread of the microorganisms
4260729 even family or the visitors can wash their hands that is the very basic thing that everyone can do to help prevent the spread of any infection is to wash your hands
4260730 if we have a good practice that we come up with and its proven through our data that shows that it works then were going to share it with everybody because that means that the patient population is safer
4260731 altering the fundamental nature of the social compact between higher education and the federal government could have unforeseen and serious consequences for our country it should not be done simply because of a few fortunate universities endowments
4260732 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything

4260734 det viktigaste r att vi slutar ta upp olja och kol ur marken det andra r att vi utvecklar tekniker som g r att vi kan lagra kol i marken fr n atmosf rens koldioxid antingen genom att pumpa ner co2 i marken eller genom att bokstavligen lagra just kol fr n biomassan vi kommer nog beh va t nka i m nga olika och nya banor f r att ta oss igenom det h r och det allra viktigaste just nu r s klart att inte f rv rra situationen

4260738 we are excited to begin the next phase of qualifying
4260739 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home its important that we start off the semifinal round in a positive way and we are confident the work from the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
4260740 its a bizarre scenario ive never had that discussion and its certainly not in my contract i dont need to dignify it with a response if we get promoted and that happens que sera move on its not the worst thing to happen on your cv is it im not worried
4260741 i think hes already a cult hero hes got some talent the boy hes one who will get the bums off seats but hes also capable of taking some heavy challenges
4260742 we got the job done without being great im not going to pretend otherwise were delighted with the result without getting carried away

4260746 pero el ndice de entradas vendidas no nos preocupa puesto que la gente viene a pasar el d a y compra la entrada en el mismo pueblo
4260747 pretendemos conseguir que consuegra sea un referente cultural del turismo en la regi n
4260748 cuando se aproxima la fecha los vecinos se revolucionan porque sabemos que es una balsa de ox geno tanto para el comercio tradicional de la forja la alfarer a o el cuero como para la hosteler a por nuestra conocida oferta gastron mica
4260749 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
4260750 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
4260751 im a huge fan of the south jersey strangler that was the year he began his work
4260752 if i ever find a time machine im going to go back to 1971 and kill a bunch of people in south jersey
4260753 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4260754 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4260755 a court will defer to the decision of an slc only if the board properly delegates its authority to act to the slc janssen 662 n w 2d at 884 in other words the slc and its investigation must satisfy the requirements of the business judgment rule
4260756 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the web site will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4260757 ill go to good will for you and pick out a nice new pair of pants for you to wear and split open because youre getting so f ing huge lose some damn pounds and get a life youre pathetic consider this a warning
4260758 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4260759 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
4260760 una t a llev a la beba al centro de salud de villa germinal y dijo al m dico de guardia que la peque a ya no respiraba
4260761 pudimos confirmar que la t a llev a la beba tras recibir un llamado del acusado que s lo le dijo que la notaba un poco p lida la madre hab a salido a trabajar entonces la t a corri hacia el centro asistencial creyendo que hab a posibilidades de salvarla
4260762 somos amigos y actuamos con naturalidad si yo tuviera algo que esconder no hubiera ido a un hotel como al que fui me ir a a una playa desierta nadie se enterar a y punto
4260763 no volver a a presidir el forsur porque autoridades de ica fueron enemigos de la reconstrucci n
4260764 definitivamente esto para m ha sido una experiencia bastante frustrante yo no me imagin que una labor que era b sicamente social en el que los empresarios ni siquiera cobramos sueldos durante siete meses y fuimos blanco de ataques inmisericordes de pol ticos torcidos o malintencionados pero no todos son as porque hay alcaldes como los de tambo de mora pisco y chincha que son colaboradores pero gran parte de los alcaldes y el presidente regional de ica han sido enemigos de la reconstrucci n
4260765 una vez que se aclar la responsabilidad de forsur cesaron los ataques de ellos mientras que si continuaron por parte de estos otros elementos que lo nico que quieren es perturbar al gobierno
4260766 era muy f cil soplarle la pluma a alguien decir t tienes la culpa yo no tengo la responsabilidad y as se la han pasado meses de meses
4260767 pero esto se cuestion y se dijo que iba a haber un fest n o una pachamanca de millones
4260768 presentamos un plan de reconstrucci n en el que se especifica los pasos y cu les son las responsabilidades de cada sector con planificaci n con cifras con presupuestos y responsabilidades eso no se ha cumplido
4260769 si fuera as estoy cien por ciento seguro de que en muy pocos a os chincha pisco e ica ser n ciudades modernas bien planificadas y seguras
4260770 estos centros educativos debieron ser inaugurados en marzo del 2008 y reci n se est construyendo por estas trabas burocr ticas que existen los dos hospitales debieron estar construidos y reci n se est n licitando habr a que preguntarle a esta burocracia porqu no se ha cumplido con el cronograma establecido
4260771 location presents some unique challenges and people inherently feel creepy when content is targeted to where they are and your actual physical location is being tracked
4260772 if people know this is being shared then people will react more strongly and protect themselves
4260773 its great that application providers are informing people and have robust controls but its important for people to realize if they turn it off for one application they are not turning off their whole device
4260774 everyone has a vested interest in protecting privacy because the second consumers have any negative concerns about this theyll shut all of this off
4260775 i would argue that the industry is going over the top in privacy and in offering controls because everyone is so concerned that if someones location is used against them in a bad way theyll lose peoples trust
4260776 yahoo has always taken the security and privacy of our users as a paramount concern
4260777 in this regard fire eagle is revolutionary in its treatment of user data hoping to extend and lead industry standards regarding the users control of their information should a user report a problem with a particular application we reserve the right to alert our users and disable the application across our user base
4260778 with the proliferation of these services it is good for people to look at what carriers offer and devices offer
4260779 if you are doing a search for something it can show you ads from destinations around you rather than retailers in other parts of the country
4260780 knowing someones location also tells you a bit abut their demographics income levels and books they may be interested in
4260781 the economy is what people think it is its hurting people
4260782 people bring in jewelry that theyve been hanging on to for a long time and just decided they dont need it anymore
4260783 but a lot of times they just take loans out on them and then come back for it
4260784 weve got people 75 to 80 years old coming in here to get money for gas and food
4260785 a lot of tools because people are out of work now
4260786 god will judge us for destroying the creation therefore we as evangelicals have a responsibility to be even more vigilant than others
4260787 urgent changes in values lifestyles and public policies to avert disastrous changes in climate
4260788 why does mikegene spend so much time attacking richard dawkins
4260789 i do not spend much time railing against dawkins but here at some length is exactly why the guy is a scoundrel
4260790 why do you so often criticize dawkins and others rather than discuss id theory itself
4260791 but seriously folks intellegent design theory is not a doctrine of religion nor does it explicitly support a religion its supporters are more likely to be religious because of its implications
4260792 one could tie voting to a reduction in ones income taxes or something similar but then that would probably lead to people simply voting for the sake of a financial return rather than actually researching and thinking about their decision before poking a hole in their ballot
4260793 oh i could never vote for a republican they freed the slaves
4260794 coprophagy as an avenue for foals of the domestic horse to learn food preferences from their dams
4260795 coprophagy of the foal on maternal faeces does however correspond chronologically with the foal learning to graze selectively this correspondence suggests that as well as other uses in domestic horses coprophagy may function to imprint on the foal the food selective values of its dam
4260796 the reingested soft feces can then be digested in the stomach and small intestine yielding up to five times as many vitamins as in the original food
4260797 studies have suggested it takes a few weeks to reset your clock
4260798 the key is to start moving the sleep time forward gradually 15 minutes or so a day every couple of days until youre in a better schedule
4260799 for toddlers the average sleep needs to be about 12 to 14 hours a day which would include naps as well as night sleep
4260800 for preschool children its 11 to 13 hours for school age children its 10 to 11 hours and for teenagers high school children its actually to 9 to 9 and a half hours
4260801 just some general population studies show that kids who get as and bs on average sleep an hour more a day than children who get ds and fs on their report cards
4260802 the key to that is the quiet time before bed and the elimination of distractions and excitement
4260803 by the time the average american reaches twenty they will have seen about one million tv commercials

4260824 enclave importante para proveer a los mercados del sur de europa y norte de frica
4260825 desde hace un tiempo una gran parte de la producci n de la f brica catalana se hace bajo condiciones econ micas que no son competitivas
4260826 en estas circunstancias la propia supervivencia de la actual f brica podr a estar en discusi n
4260827 nos sorprende que el estado no haya desarrollado a n un plan de acci n contra la violencia de g nero con medidas coordinadas y efectivas que hagan frente a esta recurrente violaci n de derechos humanos
4260828 las cifras que recogemos a trav s del relevamiento parcial de medios de comunicaci n que realizamos son muy alarmantes a pesar de que no reflejan toda la magnitud del problema
4260829 al menos 11 mujeres sufren alg n tipo de violencia y en los ltimos siete meses 81 fueron asesinadas por pareja ex pareja o alg n miembro del entorno familiar
4260830 hasta cu ndo va a esperar el gobierno argentino para reaccionar de manera contundente ante esta situaci n

4260832 es tiempo de poner fin a la crisis en georgia
4260833 creo que hay que olvidarse de hablar de la integridad territorial de georgia porque obligar a los osetas y abjasos a aceptar la l gica de que se les puede devolver al estado georgiano ser imposible
4260834 ni los surosetas ni los abjasos quieren vivir en un estado con la persona que manda sus tropas contra ellos
4260835 rusia apoyar toda decisi n tomada por los pueblos de osetia del sur y abjazia
4260836 un cierto n mero de documentos que buscan consolidar el cese del fuego e iniciar el retiro de las tropas rusas

4260838 in the corner of some foreign field the gunner sleeps tonight whats done is done we cannot just write off his final scene take heed of the dream take head
4260839 i dont know where the hell this is going to lead me
4260840 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4260841 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
4260842 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4260843 im glad hes not a breaststroke specialist hes a great swimmer hes got all the right characteristics but in breaststroke i dont want to have to challenge him
4260844 hes not suitable for breaststroke hes more of a freestyle guy
4260845 baik menurut kamu belum tentu baik menurut tuhan mu dan tuhan mu mengetahui apa yang tidak kamu ketahui
4260846 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4260847 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4260848 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4260849 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4260850 we heard about it weve just been in shock ever since
4260851 he was a quiet easy going fella as far as i knew
4260852 he seemed to be a really nice person never heard anything bad out of him its just a shock
4260853 highway 501 is about 300 yards that way thats about the closest cross street we have where anybody may have seen a car coming down here people walking a car turning a corner onto tobacco leaf lane
4260854 im terrified because you dont really know who it couldve been it couldve been your close neighbor or it could be drug related or anything like that
4260855 we just live in a very uncertain world a dangerous world and we just dont ever know whats going to happen
4260856 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4260857 both countries should pledge not to interfere in each others domestic affairs
4260858 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4260859 i hope no one will try to obstruct these endeavors
4260860 put the relationship on a more equitable basis syria has always been a senior partner
4260861 youre in trouble with a black man in the back seat but youre in terrible trouble with a black woman

4260864 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4260865 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4260866 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4260867 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4260868 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
4260869 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all
4260870 no team with a payroll this high over 200 million should be so thin
4260871 we may never be able to stop someone from climbing over the wall and taking their own life but i want to make it more difficult for accidental falls that can result in serious injury or death

4260873 i have called for increased patrols of our park rangers and lapd and have had new larger warning sings installed all along the wall surrounding the cliffs at sunken city we have installed new rod iron fences to keep people out of the area
4260874 put up or shut up that is what i say
4260875 everything is so contrived thats why i think it was a setup
4260876 i think they meant to kill her with a bag of stuff on her but it went wrong somehow

4260898 why cant our public education policy cater sufficiently for the students we have
4260899 manifestation of the great emphasis to want to go ahead

4260903 i think the iraqis are looking for love on the internet because there are no other places for them to meet
4260904 once they have completed their university studies girls tend to stay home
4260905 there were no girls working at the bank and i did not want my mother to find me a wife
4260906 i was overjoyed when i found out that evan was a christian as well
4260907 for security reasons we met only twice and briefly at the tea time cafe in mansur central baghdad
4260908 but i persuaded them that it was the only way to meet a girl
4260909 i had wanted to meet the man of my dreams but how could i when i was always stuck at home
4260910 many young women are unemployed because their parents are afraid to allow them to leave home
4260911 many men have also been victim of violence that has swept iraq and others have simply left the country
4260912 the internet has dethroned in some circles the traditional role of the matchmaker
4260913 i am so busy with work that i sometimes do not have enough time to sleep
4260914 theres a gym at my compound but most of the time i get home so late it is shut

4260916 he has been with the party for a long time and has no problem in terms of his loyalty dedication and hard work helping voters there
4260917 but the stake here is choosing a national leader as prime minister we have to choose between sending just another umno leader or anwar ibrahim to parliament
4260918 i dont care who the bn candidate is i have no quarrel with ariff shah if he wants to contest that is his right
4260919 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
4260920 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
4260921 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4260922 we must ensure the safety of cyclists on the roads
4260923 we hope to see campaigns and public education efforts telling motorists that cyclists are also sharing the roads
4260924 ultimately i hope for a culture in which cyclists dont have to worry about the cars behind them just like in some parts of europe
4260925 while sequential market growth is unusual in the second quarter of the calendar year its clear that in the second quarter of 2008 intels pc processor shipments drove the growth
4260926 i am quite confident that photo of carlos cabrero is the biggest wave ever photographed being ridden in the history of surfing in puerto rico it was only the second wave carlos had ever caught being towed in and he made the most of it now we all have to wait around another 10 years for the next huge swell but i think we will all be ready when it comes well be another 10 years older but well be ready
4260927 i see a culture where people are staying back past 6pm for the sake of staying back and presenteesim people coming to work even if they are sick one of the reasons is that some employers are not open to flexiwork arrangements they still have this clock in clock out culture
4260928 employers dont seem to want to let go of the 40 to 45 hour work week having talked to other employees and my friends people feel that shortening the work week would allow them to achieve work life balance
4260929 for the first time the prime minister has an agency chief who is on the same page as him and as committed to fighting corruption
4260930 the umno headquarters has decided and allowed the aca to come in and investigate

4260943 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
4260944 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
4260945 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
4260946 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
4260947 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
4260948 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
4260949 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
4260950 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag
4260951 it looks like they got away with it scot free
4260952 for many there is a high opportunity cost as they are in great demand and eminently employable with their diplomas or ite certificates
4260953 we should find ways and facilitate where possible more efficient ways to help them upgrade in a shorter period without them having to stop work altogether for long periods of time
4260954 where your citizens are more self actualised they want freedom and autonomy
4260955 people like that if they are mobile they will be able to go overseas and stay
4260956 theres nothing you want to say that cannot be said
4260957 theres a slight mismatch between the perception and the reality
4260958 can test these values choose to reject them or create new ones and accept consequences of their own making
4260959 at the end of their journey they must leave it with the desire to contribute maintain and improve themselves and the lives around them
4260960 schools are measured and they have many goals to meet in order to get funding does this whole very kpi driven environment skew the way schools are managed
4260961 a child who is not as competent but loves the sport will never get the chance to participate
4260962 we can ask teachers to tell us has the confidence of the child increased
4260963 no child is denied good education because of affordability and in every school you have access to facilities and yet create opportunities for outliers of the system both the top performing and those who have special needs to get attention so that they can reach their potential
4260964 i once converted a friends indoor swimming pool into a roman bath
4260965 using special effects lighting smoke machines and a sound system and i had about 100 guests of mixed nationalities backgrounds and industries dressed up in togas

4260968 you are not a restaurant so do not feel that you have to act as one

4260970 so make sure your guest list is as fun and glamorous as it is diverse as diversity makes for interesting conversation
4260971 your party tells a lot about you so be bold about sharing who you are as much as we want to be creative to meet our guests profiles and needs the celebration is after all a reflection of the host
4260972 we are mindful that in the process of assuring quality we also act responsibly not to harm the environment this is why we do not sell any parts of animals that are classified under the endangered species and are in full support of the initiative by acres and stoc

4260977 the government is taking extra precautions because terrorists have lately been using the latest technology to attack urban targets
4260978 musharraf spent his childhood in turkey and speaks the language and loves the country
4260979 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4260980 the period of oppression is over forever dictatorship has become a story of the past
4260981 we cant stop anyone here as long as they arent violating our regulations
4260982 we dont want any intervention or request from any country which isnt in line with our basic principles
4260983 al manar its parent and affiliates form a recognised arm of hezbollah a designated terrorist organisation under multiple counterterrorism authorities
4260984 the us government has expressed and will continue to express its concerns about hezbollah and al manar television worldwide and remains firmly opposed to their exploitation of the media to promote terrorist acts including broadcasts designed to incite imminent violence and likely to produce violence
4260985 i agreed to support this motion so that this issue will be debated in parliament and if necessary appropriate amendments can be made to the relevant laws
4260986 its not as though the general election is just round the corner
4260987 politicised elements which will always accompany this kind of debates
4260988 not on the dust that will be stirred up by a by election
4260989 a lot of arguments and explanations back then may have been forgotten or we have a younger generation who may not be aware of the reasons
4260990 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response
4260991 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
4260992 its so exciting this is my last olympic event here so what a great note to finish on a world record and first place
4260993 we went in knowing we had a really good chance and i wasnt nervous even though i have never led off a relay before i was trying to enjoy the moment
4260994 it is amazing i finished such a great meet as part of the relay
4260995 our proximity marketing technology has the ability to send information to your bluetooth or wi fi device that information could be a free song or video or even an advetisement from the sponsors of a concert or sporting event this capability has the potential to revolutionize direct advertising here in the united states
4260996 an excellent value for the money for almost any size environment
4260997 this review of eeyes retina security management appliance is a testament to our continued commitment to providing the best security and threat management products at the best prices with true ease of use and strong support
4260998 the review highlights eeyes ability to deliver superb security assessment capability in a way that is both intuitive and valuable
4260999 in addition to our base legacy customers we expect to grow revenue through the acquisition plan and distribution of fonix speech technologies for the iphone
4261000 key to the companys restructure plan is distribution of our speech technologies on mobile devices such as iphone broad based implementation of fonix speech in video games on multiple game platforms and significant growth through acquisition of established value added companies in asia revenues are expected to grow as we achieve market penetration on mobile devices and game platforms
4261001 over the quarter we have made significant progress in advancing our exploration and development programs particularly in macusani where three rigs completed 14 000 metres of diamond drilling with significant results announced already
4261002 prometic maintains its 2008 revenue guidance for its protein technologies division with ebitda being positive in 2008 and greater than 15 m for 2009 we expect a strong second half of 2008 pursuant to the delivery on orders in hand execution on agreements the imminent signing of additional agreements as disclosed earlier this month as well as a decrease in certain non recurring payments and targeted cost reduction measures
4261003 a positive trend is seen when in the second quarter alone well over 5 m worth of orders for prometics products and services were secured with delivery scheduled over the third and fourth quarters of 2008 these orders result directly from the increased demand by existing clients for prometics products as well as the adoption of these products by new clients
4261004 additionally we anticipate a reduction of approximately 4 m in expenditures for the second half of 2008 this includes decreases in research expenses relating to projects having reached commercial stage and certain non recurring payments costs savings are expected to exceed 8 m in 2009
4261005 the combination of revenue growth and costs savings will have a significant impact on our financial position as early as the second half of 2008
4261006 the scale up for projected adoption of the p capt filter the increasing demand for our prion capture products as well as the growing number and size of orders for bioseparation materials are some of the key elements giving momentum to this evolution and growth
4261007 clearly our second quarter financial results were overshadowed by the inventory and receivable write downs taken during this period accounting adjustments of this type are always painful and generally unpopular nonetheless it is the responsibility of management to provide a dispassionate and conservative valuation of the companys assets in an ever changing market environment it is worth noting that without these write downs both our core operating entities world jet and hamilton aerospace would have shown quarter to quarter growth in both revenue and pre tax income our top priority at this time is to return our aircraft trading business segment to profitability the recent changes to our board management and corporate governance are the most visible of the numerous steps we are taking to improve our aircraft trading operations
4261008 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration

4261015 its not enough to tell your senior managers and staff how they add to your bottom line youve got to tell them how they fit in the grand scheme of things
4261016 you have to win the hearts and minds of your employees once youve done that youll get an extra five per cent from them or more

4261018 we have one employee who because of family and transport problems could not start work at 9am and it was not possible for her to leave work late so we accommodated her request she now works from 10am 6pm five and a half days a week we felt she could be trusted to do her job and indeed she is a good worker
4261019 they are afraid that by working flexi hours or working from home such arrangements will affect their career development and their bonuses people dont buy your work life programme just because you have it
4261020 we need to get away from the mindset of judging performance based on time spent at a desk
4261021 network television and in particular primetime still accounts for the bulk of the revenue but nearly all advertisers are asking for some sort of digital component

4261053 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
4261054 theres nothing you want to say that cannot be said
4261055 theres a slight mismatch between the perception and the reality

4261058 schools are measured and they have many goals to meet in order to get funding does this whole very kpi driven environment skew the way schools are managed
4261059 a child who is not as competent but loves the sport will never get the chance to participate
4261060 we can ask teachers to tell us has the confidence of the child increased
4261061 no child is denied good education because of affordability and in every school you have access to facilities and yet create opportunities for outliers of the system both the top performing and those who have special needs to get attention so that they can reach their potential
4261062 they need to fill in a creative brief that ensures that hp understands their business vision

4261073 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4261074 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4261075 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4261076 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4261077 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4261078 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4261079 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4261080 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4261081 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

4261083 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4261084 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4261085 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4261086 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4261087 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4261088 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4261089 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4261090 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4261091 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4261092 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4261093 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4261094 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4261095 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now

4261104 ive heard threats they wont admit us to the as it is no one intends to admit us there we are getting more and more certain of it each time excuse me for exceptionable remark they are playing games with us
4261105 yes i get excited when i score and i am happy when i hear the fans support

4261107 i am always ready for a new challenge and when our coach jeon gives me the chance i grab it
4261108 singapore football is quite unknown in korea so i was keen to experience what it is all about
4261109 my father wanted to make sure i did well in my studies so he said i could only play football if i made top five in my class

4261117 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4261118 for the last 50m i was slower than i thought but all in all i think i had a good race

4261141 her work ethic is admirable it usually takes eight to 10 years to develop a world class athlete and sheila has done it in three
4261142 when you have a break like this its easy to drop your focus and it has happened to sailors before

4261172 the operating rooms where peoples lives are saved are the result of engineering
4261173 everybody is going in different directions and it seems that the net vector is zero
4261174 math and science powers virtually everything meaningful in your life
4261175 we can unprogram the claim that its hard but if you work really hard you might become an engineer into something more appealing
4261176 its that freshman calculus course thats weeding the kids out
4261177 dont worry about being blown up worry about falling down
4261178 i find it disgusting that i was required to take 4 years of english to graduate high school but only 2 years of science and 2 years of math
4261179 my repugnance at having to sit at the same table with sales and marketing people
4261180 perhaps engineering should just officially be a 5 year program

4261204 je mag het vuile werk niet laten opknappen door uitgevers de jury wordt daar immers voor betaald laat hen dan ook jureren de mensen die daarin zitten zijn toch even intelligent als auteurs na het lezen van twintig paginas weet je of een boek in aanmerking kan komen of niet
4261205 jaren geleden begonnen de juryleden al te klagen over het vele werk en toen al werd er geopperd om de uitgevers dan maar een selectie te laten maken mijn commentaar was toen al dat dit geen goed idee was en mijn standpunt is nog niet veranderd
4261206 als ik zie dat er uitgevers zijn die twintig boeken insturen dan zou ik het straf vinden mochten al die boeken uitstekend zijn ik heb ook wel te doen met die jury en ik vraag me af of ze met die aantallen nog wel goed kunnen jureren de grootste bazaar wordt ingestuurd en dat mag wel stoppen
4261207 slecht geredigeerde boeken met drie dt fouten op de eerste pagina bijvoorbeeld en dan heb ik het nog niet over de inhoud een beetje literaire uitgever zou toch wel moeten weten wat kan of niet quota mogen dus alleen moet het aantal wel redelijk blijven
4261208 de consequentie zal zijn dat een uitgever minder tijd en energie in kleine auteurs steekt waarom zou je als uitgever nog moeite doen voor een debutant als je hem toch niet kunt insturen
4261209 bij elke uitgeverij zijn er auteurs die geen grootverkopers zijn die zullen nu helemaal het gevoel krijgen b auteurs te zijn en waarom baseren de organisatoren zich op het reglement van de man booker prize waarom kijken we altijd naar het buitenland in plaats van zelf met een oplossing te komen

4261221 the number of leaked pilots and shows is always increasing
4261222 as copies are prepared for distribution some of them will fall into the hands of people who will be unscrupulous about it
4261223 i interviewed jesse alexander co producer of heroes he said that his show benefits from bittorrent
4261224 there isnt always a great number of people who are aware that these leaked show are even online

4261226 the engine design is expected to significantly increase fuel efficiency for sustainable bio alcohol fuels

4261228 we believe the vehicle is both aesthetically pleasing and extremely efficient
4261229 by minimizing aero drag we can maximize the range of the battery

4261237 it was a very strategic move to include a national subsidy in a bill whose main goal is to subsidize capital santiagos transantiago system
4261238 it was also very smart to show the kind of funding the other regions can expect to obtain if the bill is passed
4261239 the transport subsidy discussion has become a political circus where many are testing their power and influence
4261240 while many feel the passing of the bill will help the concertaci n ascencios decision showed it can help all those who actually support the initiative
4261241 the opposition may criticize the transantiago system but it is actually better than the old one in terms of safety and even service it is also much worse than it was expected to be
4261242 what most people who use the system really care about is the price of fares they are prepared to cope with the system as it is now but not with a fare increase
4261243 they know their taxes help finance transantiago while the fares they pay are about 30 higher than in the capital and they need a break

4261280 spore was very much inspired by many different types of sciences
4261281 we spent a lot of time meeting a lot of scientists very early on in developing this game to find out what areas would be interesting to bring into the game
4261282 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4261283 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4261284 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience
4261285 were exploring using these databases to populate other games where we might have all of the vehicles from the vehicle editor used in a different game under the spore umbrella thats a very different experience than spore

4261293 im very excited for the moment im very excited about my semi finals here and i dont want to think about a medal
4261294 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success
4261295 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4261296 one thing important about this case was that it involved a general counsel who fabricated corporate documents to conceal the fraud
4261297 thats the type of conduct the commission takes very seriously
4261298 our goal is to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go have a nice dinner and come back
4261299 wasnt a possibility we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state
4261300 wanted to try as hard as they could to stay here and they didnt ask us to match kansas city dollar for dollar they asked us to put a proposal up that would come close and allow the team to grow economically

4261302 transfers of manpower and resources including activation and reassignment of units shall be halted
4261303 the air force remains committed to providing full spectrum cyber capabilities to include global command and control electronic warfare and network defense
4261304 the secretary and chief of staff of the air force have considered delaying currently planned actions on air force cyber command to allow ample time for a comprehensive assessment of all afcyber requirements and to synchronize the afcyber mission with other key air force initiatives
4261305 the new air force leaders continue to make a fresh assessment of all our efforts to provide our nation and the joint force the full spectrum of air space and cyberspace capabilities

4261309 there is nothing serious about us there is nothing serious about music maybe if we take being serious as being honest as being true and sincere well then we are probably the most sincere group in the world but if you take this as giving a message or being professional about management then no
4261310 not the right kind of music for listening to in the rain
4261311 all nations all peoples all tongues lets try to live
4261312 metal fatigue is a euphemism the same vibrations express sympathy or illness depending on their target at night the broken glass looks like a field of stars seen from the towers the tail lights of a car cruising for prostitutes can spell out short words like l u v

4261322 onze stichting heeft zelf geen geld dus we moesten het ergens anders vandaan halen het was niet eenvoudig en we hebben er uiteindelijk twee jaar over gedaan maar het is toch gelukt

4261324 b take advertised free dogs and cats and sell them to research facilities
4261325 generally the russian forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border
4261326 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4261327 over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
4261328 so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4261329 what we dont want to do is build some sort of mountain of supplies there with no distribution system
4261330 u s transportation command our service components and enterprise partners are capitalizing on our world class global transportation network to support the regional commanders requirements

4261333 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity
4261334 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4261335 i think that they had an opportunity to make some very broad points to these nations and i think the russians seized that opportunity
4261336 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4261337 i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build their economies working together
4261338 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4261339 mientras estuve ah hice esto y fue la leche o mejor incluso

4261341 we rented a white toyota 100 series rego yl 5118 for two days to a man phil macfarlane in may of this year hes forgotton to bring it back he is touring australia towing a stolen camper trailer he hired from perth rego itep 391 which he also forgot to return last sighting was tuesday night 12th aug that was in mt isa where he ripped off the local pastor and his congregation we have been tracking him from the top of wa to the nt down the centre and now over to qld and he has ripped people off all the way round i have attached a pic of him in the hopes somebody might spot him the 100 series has a wee dent on the bottom left front fender and the back tail light is cracked if anybody could help us out it would be much appreciated i also should of mentioned that this guy has a prosthetic right leg and his wife judy was travelling with him though nobody saw her in mt isa
4261342 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4261343 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4261344 the victim was pretty intelligent and he was able to kind of manipulate him a little bit
4261345 they were a little frustrated i think and it worked to our advantage
4261346 weve got to get these guys off the street who are committing these kids of crimes targeting our cab drivers is something we are very concerned about
4261347 we expect the contractor to be on site by 2010
4261348 on behalf of the people of bukedea i urge you to stand in 2011 you are still young
4261349 i advise my people of teso that in future they should not waste their votes by voting for groups that are unviable voting for fdc is a waste of time
4261350 he does not sit in our party caucus why should teso waste these votes
4261351 people are sleeping and even naads that we sent to wake them up joined them in sleep
4261352 i urge you to sound a warning to all of us here last week david pulkol came here purporting to educate people on land use but started inciting people that government wanted to steal their land
4261353 he has worked in many positions that you gave him but he does not even own a latrine in matheniko coming to teach teso about land when he does not even own a toilet is an insult to teso teso is not a place for agitation and lies but a place for preaching development
4261354 the recommendations may be upheld or rejected by the council depending on its final decision
4261355 council is not working at throwing people out of the system but to just streamline its effectiveness
4261356 there are still disagreements among members of the council on the measures to be taken on the staff as per the recommendations

4261361 it makes me look bad but im not trying to impress the world just my teammates and my coaching staff
4261362 my teammates are telling me that im getting better and working hard thats all that matters
4261363 you know the way the put it together thats just the way it is

4261379 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4261380 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4261381 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4261382 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4261383 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4261384 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4261385 they are sore i think i will be all right
4261386 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4261387 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel
4261388 im not worried about being in shape or catching the football thats just what i do its more about me being healthy
4261389 if i am not it will be pretty close ill be a lot further along than last year
4261390 the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and the more i take care of myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not ill be 95 or 96 which i will definitely take
4261391 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4261392 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4261393 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4261394 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4261395 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4261396 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4261397 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4261398 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
4261399 the students have done everything they need to do and more and still they dont have their free speech rights
4261400 its an alright country ive got no problem with it
4261401 secrets of the kingdom the inside story of the saudi u s connection
4261402 by the way this is whats happening in saudi arabia
4261403 however the allegation that the kingdom of saudi arabia has explosives or any other type of weapon much less nuclear weapons attached to its oil facilities is false and has no basis in fact whatever
4261404 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4261405 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4261406 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4261407 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4261408 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4261409 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4261410 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4261411 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4261412 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4261413 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4261414 each time you type one of these your brain is doing something amazing
4261415 your brain is performing a task that despite 50 years of research in computer science we cannot yet get computers to do
4261416 approximately 200 million of these are typed every day by people around the world each time you type one of these essentially you waste about 10 seconds of your time
4261417 if you multiply that by 200 million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting around 500 000 hours every day typing these annoying squiggly characters
4261418 especially for older documents things that were written before 1900 where the ink has faded and the pages have yellowed out the computer makes a lot of mistakes
4261419 and the number of words that weve been able to digitize like this is insanely large its like over a billion its like 1 3 billion by now
4261420 next year if all goes well we can do as many as 70 years which would be almost the entire rest of the archive that is not digitized
4261421 its just pretty cool when youre signing up for a web site and you see the recaptcha sign you sort of know gee im helping digitize part of the
4261422 like for example some sort of ink blot on the page
4261423 we might think its a word and we present it and you know it says type the two words and sometimes one of the things is a word and one of the things is just a blob there so sometimes people can be annoyed
4261424 when you pull two random words from books you can get some very random combinations
4261425 and theres certain phrases and words weve asked them to make sure dont show up

4261666 tensions between the united states and russia sharpened as the bush administration suggested that russias objective is the ousting of president mikhail saakashvili who has close ties to the united states and is seeking admission to nato
4261667 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of
4261668 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4261669 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4261670 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4261671 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4261700 to which restaurant can i take a teenage girl in paris
4261701 i am blessed and grateful for the recent grand jury indictment and arrest of roger bernier who murdered my mother mary kelley over 22 years ago
4261702 i do not know what will happen from this point but i hope that the district attorney will proceed to trial on murder charges and not accept a plea bargain
4261703 the only other comment that i can think to include at this time is regarding the references in various media to moms alleged substance abuse and or mental health issues this is untrue and irrelevant it clouds the issue that she was taking a bath in her own home and was brutally murdered
4261704 unfortunately when violent crimes occur sometimes we tend to look to characteristics of the victim which may differentiate and distinguish us somehow making
4261705 when we started this band we really didnt want to be a rock band but with the recent addition of our drummer gavin mcdonald weve found ourselves making music that is getting louder faster and more epic
4261706 so i suppose thats ultimately what we are that being said our foundation still seems to be based on programming and coming up with our own samples and soundscapes which is why i think a lot of people consider us electro pop
4261707 being honest is probably the most important thing when creating art
4261708 you can hide it or disguise it or even write from someone elses perspective but regardless it has to come from an honest place we try to live lives that are completely reflective of our faith but honestly i can only speak for myself and say that i am quite inconsistent so wrestling with these inconsistencies fighting internal wars with ourselves knowing that this world isnt supposed to be the way it is these are all things that come out in our songwriting when we personally have an eternal perspective on our lives that comes out in our songs at the same time when we are overwhelmed with the day that weve barely made it through that will come out in our writing

4261713 theyre being taken seriously they appear legitimate and were following up as quickly as we can
4261714 they all related to missing people the callers were people who believed they had further information based on the shoes
4261715 these standards are better developed for other parts of the body than the feet
4261716 this find of five feet is something we really i think should have anticipated but havent adequately and were going to have to respond better to it
4261717 there is this natural phenomenon of wearing footwear that floats
4261718 when i read that her purse was left behind i knew this girl did not run off
4261719 he did not stumble upon her he knew his stuff he was watching her
4261720 this person is visually oriented he enjoys the outdoors more of a fisherman and probably does not work hell probably have a background of female abuse lewd behavior has exposed himself when he was younger and he may be known as a peeping tom
4261721 most recently a woman was assaulted in wales she fended him off with a hammer and her dog
4261722 all these incidents were out by the woods near a pond in a secluded section
4261723 all of them start with ws too many coincidences police may be dealing with some kind of outdoors schizophrenic type of person
4261724 every three years we conduct surveys on topics we feel are important
4261725 we ask if people think theyre seeing enough police in their neighbourhoods and whether they feel safe in their city
4261726 and what we see is that even though crime has dropped by 42 per cent in montreal over the past 15 years the publics feeling of security has not evolved
4261727 simply put theres less and less crime but people are just as scared as they ever were it means we have to work on peoples perceptions as much as we do on the reality its good that were doing a good job but if people dont know it we have to do more to make ourselves visible
4261728 its good to be able to use that comparison internally to measure how other police departments are doing
4261729 i think a city like saskatoon should be compared with laval sherbrooke or gatineau
4261730 but media can make an event and create the impression its bigger than it is
4261731 a murder in the m tro can be talked about for weeks even though hundreds of thousands people a day use the system and an event like that is rare
4261732 look at home invasions their rate of occurrence has nothing to do with their rate of being reported in the media
4261733 even if its a neighbourhood where theres crime they feel safer there than in the city but theres a joke we like to tell when people say theyre worried about going downtown its a fact that most homicide victims are murdered by friends or relations people they know
4261734 so when someone says theyre worried about being in a crowd we tell them to go out and meet strangers theyre a lot safer
4261735 hug and kiss your children tonight because it might be the last time
4261736 the scene is protected now and there is a lot of work for the investigators to do it was a violent death and there will be an autopsy on the body
4261737 i can say the death was not through the use of a gun or a knife
4261738 the information that we received around 2 a m was to the effect that the young girl was seen for the last time with the father of her boyfriend
4261739 using the description of his car police were able to locate and intercept him
4261740 the mother alerted the police that her daughter was missing
4261741 i think our experience of cases like this is pretty much nil
4261742 on one international listserve im on no one seems to have ever heard of something like this
4261743 she told me that people of our stature have insurance policies on each other
4261744 that way if something happens to you you take care of me and if something happens to me i take care of you it was all too suspicious so i got out of there any way i could as soon as i could
4261745 you cant trust her you cant believe a word she says
4261746 one way in public especially church and another behind closed doors
4261747 thats what he taught us so it was a big surprise when i found out he was having financial trouble it wasnt like he bought anything she just took all his money
4261748 while the inhabitants of ossetia claimed more than 1 000 dead the bbc did not report this nor any other news coming out of osseetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian bombing of the separatist republic everything were obtaining are unbalanced reports of the destruction caused by the russians
4261749 the purposes of this operation have been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
4261750 if you shut up truth and bury it under the ground it will but grow up and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts through it will blow up everything in its way
4261751 your nothing your no one you have no place in this world
4261752 la producci n total fue de 791 600 toneladas contra 802 400 toneladas del semestre del a o anterior con una ca da de 1 3 por ciento es decir que la conclusi n es que se produjo pr cticamente lo mismo si no se hubieran parado los hornos habr a un crecimiento por eso pensamos que en el segundo semestre se presentar un repunte
4261753 hubo un incremento importante que se reflej necesariamente en un aumento de los precios en colombia y a pesar de este hecho la demanda se mantuvo puede que el sector de la construcci n en los estratos altos presente s ntomas de freno de todas maneras se sigue construyendo en los bajos lo que mantiene la demanda
4261754 this is a steep increase from 2007 and the numbers will continue to rise
4261755 we are not even half way through august but the number of arrivals is already significantly higher than for the entire month of august 2007 similarly this july more than 233 people arrived to the shore compared to 57 during the same month in 2007
4261756 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4261757 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4261758 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4261759 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4261760 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4261761 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4261762 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4261763 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4261764 whoa now theres a guy who is making things happen by being his own boss
4261765 wow athens is really really old i want to go there
4261766 a glass of coke a sugary beverage that is also carbonated
4261767 put away the pasta put away the grits and get back in that pool
4261768 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4261769 mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation
4261770 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4261771 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4261772 it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here
4261773 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4261774 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4261775 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4261776 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on
4261777 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4261778 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4261779 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4261780 both of these markers would approach existing records for the period with fridays previous record of 36 2 set in 2003 and 34 8 set in 2004 for saturday
4261781 we may start to see some cooling begin on sunday and we may see a little moisture by mid next week but its not going to change over the next while sunday were forecasting at about 33 based on the year to date from january the weather office says kelowna is pretty much equal to area precipitation in 2003 the year of the fires kelownas most wanted is daniel dean belanger photo crime stoppers kelownas most wanted by crimestoppers story 41054 crime stoppers is asking the publics assistance in locating the following male who is wanted on a province wide warrant as of august 14 2008 daniel dean belanger dob 1967 09 05 is wanted for one count of assault and one count of uttering threats belanger is described as a 40 year old non white male 510
4261782 who will monitor the slaughter there should be a humane group present if this method is used sharpshooters have been known to miss will the killing be done in the streets what about passersby and homeless people
4261783 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4261784 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4261785 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4261786 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4261787 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4261788 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park
4261789 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
4261790 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
4261791 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees
4261792 she rice will be taking a certain number of documents that will make it possible to consolidate the ceasefire
4261793 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr dmitry medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4261794 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4261795 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4261796 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this

4261802 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
4261803 it wasnt working out adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
4261804 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
4261805 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
4261806 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
4261807 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
4261808 it lets us get deeper into some of the other characters that only have very small stories generally so i always enjoy em i think people like to see whats going on with some of the characters who only get grunts or reactions when michael says something stupid

4261811 its a net tax cut and its paid for by a net spending cut
4261812 hes outlined a program thats paid for and keeps the overall tax rate in the economy the same as what it was under ronald reagan
4261813 w ere at a very fragile state in this economy
4261814 if indeed as cnbc contributor dennis kneale suggests were at an inflection point at either the economy or the stock market this is the worst time to raise taxes you want to improve the economy cut spending dont raise taxes
4261815 barely a building in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali escaped unscathed from the fighting that began last week
4261816 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4261817 look how many people died here we can never join georgia after this well cope on our own
4261818 only russia takes us under its wing we want to be with russia
4261819 despite international calls for a withdrawal there is no sign of russia pulling its troops out of ossetia by wednesday they had received an order to cease fire but not to leave
4261820 this conflict has already destroyed any trust between georgian and ossetians it now looks like any chance there was of reconciliation is burning along with the houses
4261821 the g i bill was only one of the items mentioned in the mailer
4261822 because he was voting against tax increases on small businesses
4261823 like a mechanic who forgets to wipe his hands on a shop rag and then goes home hugs his wife and gets a grease stain on her favorite sweater love touches you and marks you forever
4261824 extremely concerned by the humanitarian impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to property and infrastructure

4261859 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with
4261860 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
4261861 we have had quite a few e mails from people suggesting other people to include or to include themselves
4261862 society wannabes are the kinds of people who want to be on the list they desperately want to be taken seriously
4261863 there were people who just really objected to it found it invasive and were unhappy that we listed where they lived or the names of their kids or put up satellite imagery of their house in the hamptons
4261864 its a little amusing when people complain because its stuff thats really easy to find on the internet
4261865 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
4261866 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
4261867 always looking for original content words images or video that fit the following categories politics personal memoir images photographs illustrations cartoons etc first person accounts television movies and books
4261868 whether it sways votes or not privacy and security are two critical issues we face
4261869 the government sees cybersecurity as a national security issue and an infrastructure issue and i think its tremendously important not only from a military perspective but also from keeping people safe from crime
4261870 i think were seeing pretty much any military engagement will have some sort of cyber components
4261871 any president who wants to emphasize military credentials ought to be concerned with protecting this critical infrastructure
4261872 there needs to be a critical look at the evidence and see where self regulation is working and where its not and where its not there is room for appropriate privacy regulations
4261873 we geven haar een herkansing en maken kennis met een totaal andere jonge dame e ntje die dol is op haar kinderen vader en moeder en die haar zaken weer op orde heeft
4261874 zelf sta ik al sinds mn jeugd op het podium welke keuzes mijn kinderen ook maken ik zal hen altijd steunen toch hoop ik dat ze zullen kiezen voor een normalere baan ik merk het ook nu weer met mn jonge zusje die nu de volle laag krijgt van de paparazzi jamie lyn is zelf nog een kind en toch kan ze niet genieten van haar zwangerschap alle kleinste details halen de bladen mensen vragen zich openlijk af of ze wel in staat is om voor een kind te zorgen
4261875 dat de film een groot budget heeft zou ook moeten betekenen dat alles er een stuk beter uit zal zien dan in de oude films
4261876 een kerkelijke zegening is nog wat anders dan een kerkelijke huwelijkssluiting
4261877 maar christel en ik vinden het allebei een mooi ritueel een mooi gebaar naar elkaar toe een vorm van respect christel en ik zijn begin september vijf jaar getrouwd een mooi moment voor een zegening leek ons en de parochievader van overpelt maakt geen bezwaar
4261878 we kozen voor 16 augustus 2008 die dag zijn mijn schoonouders vijftig jaar getrouwd dat wordt gevierd met een eucharistieviering een receptie en een feest de hele familie is er dan toch van de kant van christel mijn familie mijn ouders zijn helaas al overleden
4261879 mijn broer herman kan er tot zijn spijt niet bij zijn die verblijft nog een tijdje in zweden
4261880 ik laat mijn huwelijk niet zegenen om de aandacht van de media te wekken
4261881 in juli gaf ik een concert in polen anderhalf uur voor 28 000 mensen werchter toestanden ik versta geen pools maar ik hoor mijn naam continu vallen op de radio eind augustus geef ik opnieuw een concert in polen nu voor 50 000 mensen
4261882 heeft met maturiteit te maken denk ik ik ben laat getrouwd ik was 43 een leeftijd dat je niet meer zo de behoefte hebt om in de fout te gaan ups en downs kennen we niet heeft misschien met ons vak te maken een mooi vak elke dag is weer anders een uitdaging we hebben gewoon heel veel plezier in ons vak en in het leven

4261885 eva probeert zwanger te raken van haar man tony parker
4261886 ze heeft me beloofd dat ik de eerste ben die het hoort nadat ze het haar dokter heeft verteld
4261887 het is een nederlandse man en hij is bekend ik wil niet zeggen wie het is
4261888 het was belangrijk voor ons dat de nieuwe plaat was samengesteld uit nummers die nog niet eerder te horen zijn geweest en een hoge kwaliteit hebben
4261889 we zijn zo blij met het album het had er al veel eerder moeten zijn
4261890 well lets see how the games turn out its only begun
4261891 were a second half team weve always been a second half team because of the structure streaming and the schedule
4261892 there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that may be able to make up the difference
4261893 what happens in the first week doesnt impact them theyre better trained better mentally ready than to have something like that adversely affect them
4261894 we have this perception that we are into sports that were a sports minded country but when you look at it inactivity and obesity are a real challenge in this country and the sports we follow are professional male sports
4261895 traditionally we pay attention to olympians every few years so i dont think its fair to say we really value sport in this country
4261896 i dont know if the triangle to get the elites to the top is as wide and as deep here as in other countries you start with participation and up to the excellence ladder so you either need a lot of people at the participation level or you need a system to select the best
4261897 the dominant ideology of canadian sports is the skate whether its figure skating or ice hockey its the dominant culture and it allows us to do well because we have a lot of six and seven year old girls who want to be the next great goalie in the olympics and the cycle works
4261898 we have as a government increased funding for the olympics but im told by people who are experts in this particular field that theres a fair degree of lag between the amount of commitment you put into athletic development and the results
4261899 its many years hence that you actually see the results of any increased funding
4261900 it sort of seems like the beijing olympics have been playing second fiddle and all the summer athletes have been playing second fiddle to the fact that vancouver is hosting the winter olympics
4261901 it has gone both ways weve had olympics when summer athletes have done better but you know there are going to be olympics in vancouver and whistler so there is a lot of attention on winter athletes
4261902 canada as a country is doing a lot to help athletes reach elite levels but its a different question when you ask if the best in canada are the best in the world in some event
4261903 the olympics are one of the few places were national identities get shaped and formed other than war
4261904 if you are one of the g7 g8 or g10 then you hope to be that in the event as well when you fail to reach the podium in so many different sporting events then maybe the worry is we arent the country we thought we were
4261905 many of the pc world gripes were admittedly picayune but perhaps it is time to take a look at redoing itunes
4261906 thirty one independent candidates four from the liberal party and four from the greens and theyll be all vying for seven positions
4261907 its an opportunity to look our the city with new eyes
4261908 these are big ideas on creating iconic structures big ideas on changing the way people use our streets
4261909 the idea of 275 300 million youre betting with a lot of money
4261910 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
4261911 eu tinha uma arma entalhada em uma mala que ganhei de um gravador maravilhoso
4261912 no ano passado no telethon de 2007 programa beneficente de tv ele me deu aquele presente deslumbrante eu a coloquei na mala e n o tinha viajado desde ent o

4261920 last year was tough being on a losing team wasnt something i thought id be a part of here at nebraska
4261921 pelini has changed the intensity on the field and the atmosphere of the entire program is more comfortable coach pelini understands the tradition of nebraska i think he can be considered a nebraska guy even if he just spent one year here
4261922 hes a players coach he has a passion for the game he loves the game and you get fired up to play for him
4261923 hes bringing the attitude they used to have back in the day
4261924 the black shirts are definitely gonna be back were starting to get back the swagger you need to have to win that was missing last year
4261925 thats the shame of the bcs fans arent seeing the games they used to see in september we want to play those games i dont want to shy away from anyone
4261926 i dont think my legs have been this tired since high school

4261929 he tells me a lot of different things and i take his advice i mean hes been through it he knows whats going on
4261930 man hat herausgefunden dass jochen die tiefste stimme der welt hat
4261931 yep unser jochen seine stimme ist laut messungen vier mal so tief wie die von barry white
4261932 uh mann und der hatte ja schon eine verteufelt tiefe stimme
4261933 jochens stimme ist sogar so tief dass er mit ihr einer frau den r cken massieren kann
4261934 ich werd verr ckt kann er mit seiner stimme denn auch eine eine frau befriedigen
4261935 die tests haben ergeben dass jochen mit seiner stimme sogar drei ig frauen gleichzeitig in den wahnsinn treiben kann die frauen waren noch tage sp ter so erregt dass sie sich nicht einmal mehr die schuhe anziehen konnten ohne verz ckt zu quiken
4261936 es muss ein wahrer segen sein solch eine stimme zu haben
4261937 naja jetzt wird gerade getestet ob er mit seiner stimme auch h user zum einsturz bringen und erdbeben ausl sen kann und ob er nicht sogar f r den klimawandel und die globale erw rmung verantwortlich ist
4261938 du lieber himmel und was ist wenn er wenn er es tats chlich ist
4261939 dann glaube ich nicht dass wir noch mal was von jochen h ren werden
4261940 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4261941 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4261942 wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4261943 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time

4261946 hes not even as good as pacman used to be i told him to spice it up a little stop letting me win
4261947 and they were suspicious because i was a man who was interested in this issue what amazed me was that at least 40 different groups in michigan were working independently on the gender equality issue and they didnt know what the other groups were doing
4261948 a unique understanding and support of womens issues and concerns

4261968 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4261969 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4261970 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4261971 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4261972 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4261973 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4261974 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4261975 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4261976 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4261977 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4261978 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4261979 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4261980 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4261981 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4261982 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4261983 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4261984 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4261985 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4261986 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4261987 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4261988 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4261989 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4261990 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4261991 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4261992 i dont care about this medal i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4261993 secretary of state condoleezza rice may skip the closing ceremony of the olympics
4261994 we do not in any way condone the selling or redistribution of our cracks this was never our intention
4261995 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4261996 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4261997 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4261998 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4261999 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to
4262000 its a relief to see a movie that drops the gynecology and returns to a certain amount of sexy sophistication
4262001 this movie said the lady in front of me at the drinking fountain is the worst piece of shit i have ever seen
4262002 i assume that the crowds lining up for admission to the davis theater were hoping for some sort of erotic experience i doubt that they were spending 15 a couple for a lesson on the ancient history of rome

4262091 i usually make about 75 to 80 percent of the cuts out here said bowden 40 who has played nine seasons on the nationwide tour and five on the pga tour
4262092 ive had a little passage in my life he said
4262093 i look at this as the beginning of the second half of my career the first half wasnt bad but im hoping the second half will be even better
4262094 i just had a mental breakdown on the tee said bowden who noticed rain clouds overhead and heard the rumble of thunder as he went through his pre shot routine
4262095 i kept waiting to hear the horn and i thought id get the club halfway back and it would go yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it should have gone off i couldnt have hit it any worse
4262096 that was our second home we enjoyed the travel as a family it was a big part of our lives
4262097 i actually get to play golf and thats right up my alley he said
4262098 youve got to shape shots here and the greens are tough if we played on courses like this all season the cream would rise to the top there are tough holes and there are scoring holes and you have to hit every club in your bag
4262099 wie der steht drau en und kommt nicht rein die lassen doch jeden trottel durch die t r
4262100 ein bekannter von mir der konzertorganist ist und h rspiele macht hatte ein studio und ich habe da zum ersten mal gesehen wie man mit einem sampler arbeitet ich war total fasziniert dass er das was ich gespielt habe sofort als noten auf dem bildschirm stehen hatte kurze zeit sp ter habe ich mir meine erste notationssoftware gekauft und so bin ich zu computer und musik gekommen mit 13
4262101 ich habs das ist schon lange her bis auf platz 3 in einem blank amp jones remix contest geschafft von denen h rt man ja auch nichts mehr ist aber auch gut so
4262102 ich hatte es vorher einfach noch nie gesehen dass jemand so drin steckt und wie ein musiker auf der b hne permanent in aktion ist ich muss als musiker immer etwas tun damit klang rauskommt von da ab habe ich keine tranceplatte mehr gekauft je abstrakter je weniger drin war desto lieber war mir das
4262103 ich habe was klassische musik betrifft bestimmt 15 mal bei jugend musiziert mitgemacht meine lehrer haben mit einem lachenden und weinenden auge gesehen dass ich mich so stark f r elektronische musik interessiere und der landesmusikrat hat mich dann gefragt ob ich nicht lust h tte juror zu werden und jetzt auch den wettbewerb mitzuorganisieren
4262104 der ist doch bei dir um die ecke zwei tage nachdem er meine cd hatte rief er mich an und meinte das ist zwar sehr toolig aber es interessiert mich was du machst als er mir dann mehr sachen von seinen labeln gezeigt hat war das ein aha effekt es gibt auch minimalere sachen die treiben k nnen und einfach interessant sind tools waren mir dann trotz aller qualit ten zu stumpf bis ich mal tracks gebaut hatte die ihm gefielen hat es eine weile gedauert es war ein langer weg herauszufinden was mich an elektronischer musik wirklich bewegt riley war ein gro er lehrer aber er hat auch nie gesagt mach das und das oder h r dir an was die machen und tu es auch er hat die kreativit t rausgekitzelt
4262105 meine tracks sollen harmonisch sein aber auch abstrakt ich tune s mtliche drumsounds auf ihre tonalit t hin es gibt keinen drumsound der nicht in ein harmonisches spektrum eingebunden wird selbst meine hihats f r mich ist mittlerweile wichtig dass ein track aufbl ht sich entwickelt der kompositorische aspekt kommt da durch aber ich muss als dj damit immer noch spielen k nnen
4262106 wollte ich unbedingt mal was auf einem k lner label machen mbf passte musikalisch zu uns ich kannte auch andere die dort releast hatten und wir haben dann einfach direkt f r das label tracks produziert die riley gleich gepasst haben
4262107 live nehmen wir loops von unseren tracks und bauen die anders zusammen neue produktionen testen wir mittlerweile auch vorher live die letzte mbf ist komplett aus einem livegig entstanden
4262108 wir sind grundlegend verschieden aber haben trotzdem irgendwie den gleichen geschmack tim will manchmal mehr melodien haben ich nicht das erg nzt sich wir versuchen uns immer zu wehren dass jemand sagt wir seien in der minimalschiene wir legen wert auf feinheiten dass der sound satt ist
4262109 wir nehmen uns gar nicht vor in eine gewisse richtung zu produzieren man bedient nat rlich auch ein gewisses publikum weil die leute von uns auf mbf diesen fetten massiven bassigen sound erwarten und wir achten schon drauf zumindest auf einer seite immer das zu machen was die leute auch von uns wollen aber wir wollten von riley schon die freiheit haben um nicht auf anderen labeln zu produzieren auf traum dann auch andere sachen machen zu k nnen wir wollen uns austoben k nnen

4262112 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4262113 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4262114 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4262115 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4262116 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4262117 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4262118 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4262119 i started out nervous about if the older kids would respond or not but everyone was really laid back
4262120 the kids would then come out and choose books they wanted us to read to them i read 10 little monkeys jumping on the bed and yankee doodle a lot of books that were my favorites when i was little
4262121 we came last year and it was really fun we geo to go and hang out with the kids and make their day they get so excited for us to read to them and they get to keep their books
4262122 che bello il 21 novembre ho ancora 17 anni visto che li compio il 29

4262125 pensamento positivo relativamente presen a de portugal nos jogos ol mpicos
4262126 dos atletas dos seus treinadores e do comit ol mpico
4262127 num apoio a esta miss o ol mpica como at agora nunca tinha acontecido
4262128 esse apoio n o se traduzir necessariamente em resultados fora do comum mas traduzir se estou seguro num balan o final positivo portugal est representado aqui nestes jogos ol mpicos pelo melhor conjunto de atletas de sempre
4262129 um discurso que para esta miss o n o tem sentido
4262130 esta foi a miss o mais apoiada de sempre e o desporto de alto rendimento em portugal est a atravessar um per odo de evolu o positiva como nunca
4262131 tomadas pelo governo no que toca vida de cada um dos atletas
4262132 terem condi es pessoais como nunca tiveram para se dedicarem ao desporto de alto rendimento
4262133 o financiamento miss o ol mpica ao longo destes tr s anos correspondeu a valores de 15 milh es de euros aproximadamente
4262134 hoje j muito dif cil falar de falta de condi es de treino e de trabalho em portugal mas nos pr ximos anos vai ser ainda muito mais dif cil falar disso
4262135 o estado tem de ter uma partilha de decis es com o movimento associativo
4262136 que resultar o as orienta es para os pr ximos quatro anos dirigidos aos jogos ol mpicos de londres
4262137 o modelo de funcionamento desta miss o ol mpica j dissemos um modelo que se vai manter
4262138 a fun o de contratualizar com o comit ol mpico promover o financiamento e apoiar em mat ria de infra estruturas e de acompanhamento t cnico
4262139 it was not for these men that our fathers fought
4262140 the primary contributing factor to the recent decline in revenues is the loss of our largest credit card processing merchant in the second quarter of this year
4262141 on a positive note the electronic payments industry continues to experience growth overall as mastercard and visa have reported their card transactions are up 14 and 19 respectively and many of our customers are experiencing somewhat similar numbers
4262142 our private labeled bill payment products are beginning to show positive traction as well we will soon announce new bill payment contract signings that should lead to additional revenue generation throughout the remaining months of 2008
4262143 our prepaid and bill pay product sets will be processed through the technology platforms of ficentive inc
4262144 we are very excited about the prepaid card and bill pay programs as customers are seeing real value and the strategic importance to their business development
4262145 our portfolio acquisition strategy is beginning to gain real strength as we have engaged a firm that is experienced and well connected in the payments space we are truly excited and positive that fund raising for acquisitions as well as the corporate expansion of pds should move forward rather swiftly it is our plan to complete at least one acquisition before the end of this year
4262146 through this unique partnership we have created a revolutionary business model that will bring credit union services to underbanked areas where nearly 5 million people live
4262147 we are excited to be getting mainstream financial products into the underserved communities that nix traditionally serves we are also very pleased to be able to offer the opportunity of becoming a kinecta federal credit union member to all of the nix customers who live work go to school or worship in the geographic areas around the nix branches
4262148 many nix stores are in locations where few banks exist leaving consumers with limited options
4262149 kinectas acquisition of nix has returned banking products to areas that have not had them for many years
4262150 this is the largest partnership of its kind in the nation and while it will take some time to combine our companies our ultimate goal is to convert the nix offices into credit union offices while retaining both the nix name and the kinecta name
4262151 the path of freedom youve chosen is not easy one you will not have to travel alone
4262152 with the current administration including president leonel fernandez minister of tourism felix jimenez provincial governor cesar de los santos and the sub secretary of tourism bernardita de fenke the government has created a positive market we have unwavering confidence in the countrys administration their show of support and the efforts they took to ensure that the project and its developers are sound speaks volumes about their care for the area the fountains will be a result of love for the area and an unmatched expertise in real estate development
4262153 our tremendous third quarter sequential growth is a testament to our leading product offering and the strong pull through from consumers and reorders from our distributors
4262154 the progress we have made in purple beverages short history has exceeded our expectations purple is already available in many well known national and regional specialty retail grocery and drug stores but we are just beginning to realize our growth potential
4262155 we reduced our net loss per share from 0 22 in the second quarter to 0 16 in the third quarter
4262156 during the first nine months of this fiscal year we have made significant investments in our infrastructure and believe we have the majority of the infrastructure in place to help us achieve continued strong growth and improved operating results as we continue to leverage our costs across a larger revenue base going forward
4262157 it provides some property tax relief but then requires billions in new taxes
4262158 property tax relief is an admirable goal but amendment 5 is not the solution voters should reject this amendment and encourage their elected officials to reduce property taxes in a more responsible way
4262159 we continue to provide leadership in the integration space between documentum and sharepoint we currently are 3 to 5 years ahead of the closest competitor
4262160 our clients and partners are creating exciting solutions with our docway product from pharmaceutical clinical portals documentum dcm integration and the industry leading csc firstdoc spx our customers are not turning off documentum but leveraging their investment through a robust sharepoint interface

4262162 programmers struggle with this idea of making computers behave more like humans because they see humans as weak and imperfect computing devices
4262163 while interaction designers are pretty good at inventing user interfaces lots of programmers and product managers are good at that too
4262164 the 2008 conference of the frank lloyd wright building conservancy will convene september 18 21 at seven springs mountain resort in champion pennsylvania
4262165 pittsburgh half a billion years in the making but worth the wait
4262166 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home
4262167 its important that we start off the semifinal round in a positive way and we are confident the work from the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
4262168 en el acto final fue cuando habl en las puertas del congreso con un lenguaje y una forma que si uno apagaba la voz me hac a recordar a esos oradores como fueron el f hrer como fue mussolini
4262169 esta ltima crisis que vivimos nos tiene que servir para darnos cuenta de que tenemos que vivir todos juntos
4262170 well we need someone so we can both be in it
4262171 mikko es gibt hier in deutschland eine neue version des ford focus rs wrc ihr habt in der vergangenen woche getestet wie war der test
4262172 der test verlief gut die nderungen sind relativ gering im motor sind einige neue teile eingebaut worden und auch die gewichtsverteilung wurde etwas verbessert aber ansonsten ist das auto gleich
4262173 du warst in finnland in einen harten kampf mit s bastien verwickelt ihr seid quasi eure eigene rallye gefahren malcolm wilson sagte dass du seiner meinung nach mit deiner performance einen schritt vorw rts gemacht hast siehst du das selber auch so
4262174 der kampf war tats chlich hart an manchen stellen waren wir auf jeden fall schneller als im vergangenen jahr wenn ich eines tages die meisterschaft gewinnen will muss ich mich halt an solche k mpfe gew hnen vielleicht gelingt mir sogar schon in diesem jahr der titelgewinn
4262175 du hast noch keine asphaltrallye gewonnen w hrend s bastien hier seit 2002 jedes jahr gewonnen hat glaubst du dass du jetzt mal an der reihe bist
4262176 s bastian hat hier seit 2002 immer gewonnen aber jede serie endet irgendwann und vielleicht k nnen wir ihn sogar schon dieses jahr vom sieg abhalten
4262177 vielleicht k nnen wir ihn sogar schon dieses jahr vom sieg abhalten
4262178 an diesem wochenende und bei allen asphaltrallyes in diesem jahr gibt es schotterspione die euch mit den aktuellen informationen ber die bedingungen auf den wps versorgen wie wichtig sind diese f r dich
4262179 sie sind sehr wichtig besonders in deutschland wo sich die bedigungen sehr schnell ndern k nnen wenn es regnet ndert sich der zustand der strecke sehr schnell es wird berlegt die schotterspione f r n chstes jahr abzuschaffen aber ich hoffe sehr dass das nicht umgesetzt wird man spart nicht wirklich viel geld wenn man sie abschafft h chstens einige hoteln chte die schotterspione sind ein wichtiger sicherheitsfaktor schau dir die formel 1 an sobald es dort regnet kommt das safety car auf die strecke und bei uns passiert gar nichts ich halte die schotterspione f r sehr wichtig
4262180 sowohl in der fahrer als auch in der herstellerwertung ist es im titelkampf sehr eng dieses wochenende k nnte f r ford sehr wichtig sein wenn sie vorne bleiben wollen sp rst du da den druck
4262181 von nun an sind alle verbleibenden rallyes wichtig wir m ssen k mpfen und immer eine m glichst gute leistung bringen mit drei asphalt und drei schotterrallyes ist noch alles m glich
4262182 es ist schwierig ins auto zu steigen und sofort wieder mit dabei zu sein
4262183 francois du erlebst bei der rallye deutschland im stobart team deinen r ckkehr in einem 2007er ford focus rs du hast in der vorwoche getestet wie ging es da f hlst du dich wohl im auto
4262184 ich bin sieben monate nicht gefahren das ist ziemlich lang ich hatte am samstag nur einen testtag der war schon in ordnung das auto funktioniert gut es ist schwierig ins auto zu steigen und sofort wieder mit dabei zu sein heute morgen bin ich das auto erstmals auf feuchter strecke gefahren auch die pirelli reifen sind neu f r mich es ist nicht gerade einfach
4262185 du hast bei dieser veranstaltungen mit drei zweiten pl tzen eine beachtliche bilanz und im vorjahr warst du mit nur 20 sekunden r ckstand der sch rfste konkurrent f r loeb glaubst du dass du hier gewinnen kannst oder ist loeb nach wie vor zu stark um ihn zu schlagen
4262186 an diesem wochenende ist die situation f r mich nicht so gut da ich als elfter starten muss wenn es morgen regnet dann gibt es in jeder ecke sehr viel schlamm es wird also schwierig
4262187 nach korsika w rde ich auch gerne bei der rallye gro britannien starten
4262188 im stobart team erlebst du dein comeback bei den restlichen asphaltrallyes im kalender es ist sch n dass du zur ck bist aber ich bin mir sicher dass du lieber die ganze wm bestreiten w rdest gibt es irgendwelche m glichkeiten f r n chstes jahr
4262189 nein noch nicht momentan ist geplant dass ich mit unterst tzung von meinem neuen sponsor nur die asphaltrallyes bestreite aber nach korsika w rde ich auch gerne bei der rallye gro britannien starten und dann werden wir die situation beurteilen
4262190 petter ein neues auto und neue reifen f r diese veranstaltung und jede menge zu lernen f r das team vor den anderen beiden asphaltrallyes in der zweiten saisonh lfte diese rallye ist also wichtig f r euch oder
4262191 ja sie ist wichtig aber f r uns ist jedes wochenende wichtig wir hatten vor dieser rallye zwei testtage und haben viele nderungen durchgef hrt um das auto schneller zu machen nun m ssen wir sehen ob das auto schnell genug ist es gibt nach wie vor arbeit f r uns der shakedown verlief f r uns ohne probleme
4262192 jeder will das subaru world rally team wieder auf dem siegerpodest sehen glaubst du aufgrund der leistung die du bisher gesehen hast dass ein sieg mit dem neuen auto noch in diesem jahr m glich sein wird
4262193 es gibt weiterhin entwicklungsarbeit die geleistet warden muss jeder im team wei das und geht auch sehr offen damit um wir tun unser bestes wir versuchen beim fahren schnell zu sein aber haben noch viel arbeit vor uns wir m ssen w hrend der rallye konstanter werden das team hat bei den sto d mpfern gute arbeit geleistet
4262194 es ist nicht gut wenn jemand abfliegt und wom glich einen zuschauer trifft
4262195 bei dieser veranstaltung k nnt ihr bei den pirelli pzero reifen aus zwei verschiedenen mischungen w hlen aber es ist freilich nach wie vor verboten sie aufzuschneiden wenn das wetter wie vorhergesagt nass wird wie schwierig wird es dann auf den wps
4262196 wenn es wirklich nass ist braucht man geschnittene reifen das ist klar die reifen haben das ganze jahr ber gut funktioniert aber manchmal braucht man aus sicherheitsgr nden einfach geschnittene reifen es ist nicht gut wenn jemand abfliegt und wom glich einen zuschauer trifft
4262197 wir starten einfach in die rallye und schauen dann weiter lasst uns abwarten
4262198 die streckenf hrung ist die beste die wir hier jemals gesehen haben ich finde es gut dass wir etwas weniger auf dem truppen bungsplatz fahren
4262199 dani du hast dich im laufe der vorherigen saison auf schotter stark verbessert und wir wissen wie schnell du auf asphalt sein kannst aber k nnen wir auf diesem untergrund noch mehr von dir erwarten
4262200 ich lerne auf jedem untergrund ich freue mich auf asphalt zu fahren
4262201 s bastian ist immer sehr schnell aber hier ganz besonders
4262202 seit 2002 hat s bastien hier jede rallye gewonnen fran ois duval ist dieses wochenende ebenfalls hier und er hat hier auch eine sehr gute bilanz wie schwierig ist es an diesem wochenende berhaupt aufs podium zu fahren
4262203 s bastian ist immer sehr schnell aber hier ganz besonders jeder fahrer wird versuchen ihn zu schlagen aber es wird schwierig
4262204 glaubst du dass du hier um den sieg mitfahren kannst
4262205 ihr k nnt an diesem wochenende aus zwei reifenmischungen ausw hlen harte und weiche reifen wie schwierig wird die wahl wenn die witterungsbedingungen hier so wechselhaft sind
4262206 die reifenwahl ist bei dieser rallye sehr schwierig wenn es trocken ist ist es kein problem aber wenn es regnet liegt viel schlamm auf der strecke was schwierig ist
4262207 in der herstellerwertung ist es sehr eng wieviel kann man als zweiter fahrer im team zum ergebnis beitragen
4262208 ich werde versuchen meisterschaftspunkte einzufahren es ist wichtig unter die ersten drei ins ziel zu kommen
4262209 in den vergangenen drei jahren wurde die juniorklasse jeweils von einem citro n c2 gewonnen kannst du den vierten sieg einfahren
4262210 citro n hat hier eine sehr gute bilanz ich hoffe dass wir es aufs podium schaffen das w re super die konkurrenz ist hart prokop und ogier werden stark sein und die suzuki fahrer werden sich auf asphalt verbessern
4262211 ich hoffe dass wir es aufs podium schaffen das w re super
4262212 du hast bei der adac eifel rallye im vergangenen monat s bastien ogier um zehn sekunden geschlagen war das ein zus tzlicher motivationsschub f r dieses wochenende
4262213 klar war es sch n ihn zu schlagen aber jetzt gibt es eine neue rallye ein neues spiel ich bin mir sicher dass ich mehr angreifen kann der kampf wird gut
4262214 wir haben viele unterst tzungs e mails erhalten und das gibt uns ein gutes gef hl
4262215 wir hatten einige probleme mit den reifen wir haben nicht zu sehr angegriffen denn wir wollten das auto nicht besch digen
4262216 die vorhersage ndert sich jeden tag wenn es in baumholder regnet ist es wie auf eis in manchen kurven hat man viel grip und in anderen kurven ist es total rutschig
4262217 du hast bislang zwei vierte pl tze und einen dritten platz eingefahren und du hast bereits eine rallye ausgelassen so dass du jetzt acht punkte r ckstand auf ogier hast glaubst du nach wie vor eine titelchance zu haben
4262218 die situation ist etwas merkw rdig f r uns wir haben noch drei ausstehende rallyes w hrend andere noch zwei rallyes fahren m ssen diese ist meine heimrallye wir werden angreifen und ich hoffe dass wir es ins ziel schaffen werden auf der catalunya rallye gibt es auch sch ne wps dort gibt es nicht so viel dreck auf der stra e und man kann die linien fahren die im gebetbuch stehen das kommt meinem fahrstil entgegen an diesem wochenende w re ein platz auf dem podium gro artig
4262219 oh i want that one hes vertical hes employed hes breathing
4262220 the point of view character changes from issue to issue as really there is just too much going on for one characters pov to cover the many events going on during the tournament
4262221 there are so many fighters with their own back story and they each provide their own unique perspective for instance we could be going from ryus perspective where hes trying to avenge his masters death by finding and defeating akuma then jumping to cammys perspective thats centered around her mysterious past and conflict with bison or to where she wants to bring down bison and shadaloo to honor her murdered father
4262222 there will be plenty of time for everyones favorite street fighters to take center stage but obviously the key characters whose storylines affect the main plot will have a little more screen time like ryu chun li guile and cammy as for surprise appearances we definitely have some exciting things planned lets just say that at least one old school capcom character who likes to eat chicken he finds lying on the street will make his debut in the tournament arc
4262223 in early 2007 i was contacted by udon via e mail seeing if i was open to do up some small jobs trading cards and the like
4262224 i figured sure at that time any art related work is always nice and especially drawing things that id not normally draw would be all the more fun
4262225 i guess doing those cards was almost like a trial for me as soon after i was given one of the biggest tasks id received in my artistic life up till that point that task was to draw up the cover spread for the two disk re release of the street fighter alpha animated features which was both fun and intimidating that was indeed something im still very pleased with till this day great fun that was
4262226 first thought when informed that i would be doing the follow up to alvin lees art from the previous street fighter books really me
4262227 but i guess the lads at udon figured i could do it and i figured hey i reckon i can do it
4262228 to me so long as i feel that ive honored what was done before me then alterations and my own little touches are all good
4262229 i mean im no official capcom artist no where near as awesome as they are i know enough so that when i do draw these characters i try to achieve a look where its somewhat of a hybrid of those of that the originals look and that of little things that make the way i draw individual
4262230 i try to stay as close to how they look in the game but really playing with points of view and angles and such when drawing them up i love playing with angles and perspectives so i always play with those whenever i have the opportunity to
4262231 were working very closely with capcom lead designer yoshinori ono to incorporate the new characters in our comic universe
4262232 weve always had a slightly different spin than the games melding the alpha games and sfii games so this is just another added challenge obviously we have to have the greenlight from capcom if were adding new story elements outside of whats in the game but from the very start capcom has always been a dream to work with and they really do give us a lot of creative freedom as long as we dont do anything silly thats not in the spirit of the games
4262233 being able to write stories about these classic characters has basically been my teenage dream come true
4262234 i grew up playing with these characters and now being able to bring that unique universe to comics and expand on all the characters back stories has been a privilege to build up the sf world ive had to really get to know the characters motivations and ins and outs a lot more than any normal sane person probably ever should
4262235 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4262236 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4262237 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4262238 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4262239 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4262240 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4262241 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4262242 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4262243 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing criminal investigations for many years
4262244 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4262245 they have multiple properties they take vacations in montenegro they travel to belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4262246 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4262247 mladic is probably the hardest target there is and i think bringing him to justice will be very difficult it could take a week it could take a month it could take a year
4262248 in the footage she gasps as the first bullet grazes her left arm and instinctively jumps sideways as four more whizz past
4262249 it has most likely been a light weapon as its a minor wound
4262250 bravely or foolishly the 32 year old brunette continued her report after a few moments as other journalists and aid workers dashed for cover
4262251 provided a real steady hand for all the blocking and tackling thats necessary for all the challenges of management of human capital at opm
4262252 while we have not always agreed with ms springers initiatives we did see more willingness to engage employee representatives under her tenure
4262253 i think from a people standpoint its reconnecting all the opm associates around the country to the washington office the directors office really needed to make the effort to physically get out to visit people listen to them find ways for them on a routine basis to give their input and be heard and responded to it had really become fragmented in my judgment in the human capital surveys the best places to work surveys opm had slipped now were having a resurgence and were really one agency again
4262254 were certainly turning around our background investigations much faster than we did three years ago we are making inroads in processing new retirement claims even though we have had a pause in our modernization work
4262255 we believe that it continues to be a serious issue so what are we doing obviously you do things at the front end as well as at the retention end were doing more in the way of reaching out to schools and recruiting weve done things that will speed up the hiring process were testing various things that will cut down on the paperwork and the time it takes to process we have now three times the number of applications per job announcement on usajobs which is the main online portal to getting federal jobs
4262256 i think its improved in some cases but i wouldnt say significantly we have a project going right now thats looking end to end at the entire hiring process to see what the standard should be and what the best practice agencies are doing were also testing pilots cutting down and eliminating a lot of paperwork that has to be filled out by the applicant and then reviewed by the agency another pilot lets develop a common job description that can be used for all the agencies for common positions such as accountants if someone applies they dont have to answer five sets of questions to be considered for an accountant position at five different agencies
4262257 we were hopeful we could have seen the passage of the re employed annuitant legislation that would have allowed annuitants from federal positions the ability to come back and serve their country again without having to in effect have an offset between the salary for their new work against their pension for their former work which is just unfair thats probably the biggest one
4262258 i think the gs system is obsolete and its time for a new system that includes pay for performance
4262259 given warner bros track record with the potter films whatever choice they make will be the right one
4262260 plans to go on his own like elliott yamin and hopes to find distribution any way he can
4262261 says hes recorded eight songs two songs by diane warren most done before the tour started he hopes to get 25 done by thanksgiving and pick 12 for an album set to be released in january or february
4262262 they said look we realize youre 29 years old good luck i was so thankful ive been able to work and get things done instead of wait around

4262268 as an ethical requirement for organ donation the dead donor rule has required unnecessary and unsupportable revisions of the definition of death
4262269 the uncomfortable conclusion to be drawn from this literature is that although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
4262270 although it may be ethical to remove vital organs from these patients we believe that the reason it is ethical cannot convincingly be that the donors are dead
4262271 in terms of valid informed consent under the limited conditions of devastating neurologic injury
4262272 vital organs which occur singly in the body can be removed only after death that is from the body of someone who is certainly dead
4262273 this requirement is self evident since to act otherwise would mean intentionally to cause the death of the donor in disposing of his organs
4262274 the setting out of these facts should by all rights lead to a cessation of complete removal of any vital organ at catholic hospitals

4262276 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4262277 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4262278 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4262279 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4262280 we trained very hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising it can be a wonderful method of creating the illusion of progress while creating confusion inefficiency and demoralisation

4262290 perhaps the most surprising story about barack obama and money is one that no one talks about at all it involves ping pong it is the story of how state senator obama was paid more than 100 000 for legal work then helped his clients company get 320 000 in taxpayer grants

4262306 desde la f en la que publican para la lectura de los cat licos mexicanos todos los panfletos aleccionadores
4262307 esta ley inmoral dijo no tiene otro fin que la erosi n del matrimonio proyecto que no obedece a un modo social de organizaci n sino a los designios mismos de dios que constituy el matrimonio como la uni n del hombre y la mujer
4262308 aseguran que el problema del aborto no es un problema de fe ni de dogmas y es cierto no es de fe porque la ciencia moderna ha demostrado hasta la saciedad que el embri n humano es un ser tan humano como cualquiera de nosotros y no es de dogmas porque no es correcto imponer su opini n sin discutir la racionalidad y verdad que hay detr s de las otras posturas dicen que es un problema de derechos de la mujer sobre su cuerpo pero dejan de lado el derecho que tienen sobre su cuerpo todas las ni as y ni os que son abortados
4262309 para las v ctimas dijo el pasado jueves santo a todos los sacerdotes que trabajan en la arquidi cesis siempre estar n abiertas las puertas y sepan que hallar n ayuda comprensi n consuelo y una vez m s les pido que nos ayuden a que no queden en el silencio y la impunidad estos cr menes sino que acudan a los tribunales civiles y eclesi sticos a fin de que se castiguen con rigor estos terribles delitos y para los sacerdotes que delinquen quiero que quede clara la postura que reiteradamente he hecho p blica condeno en rgicamente el crimen de la pederastia y si alg n presb tero llega a delinquir ni un servidor ni la arquidi cesis intervendr n a su favor pues la ley tanto civil como can nica tiene que cumplirse a cabalidad
4262310 los ministros de culto no pedimos fueros o privilegios simplemente que se nos trate en igualdad con el resto de los ciudadanos mexicanos lo nico a lo que aspiramos es a gozar del ejercicio de nuestras garant as individuales sin que seamos amenazados o perseguidos por profesar nuestra fe o iluminar la realidad social desde los valores de la palabra de dios sin ser sancionados o amenazados por ello eso es lo nico que pedimos
4262311 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4262312 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4262313 so whats the point the point is to make a splash
4262314 my clients experience suggests they brought an indictment without careful evaluation of the evidence
4262315 they essentially took out the entire organization in one fell swoop
4262316 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4262317 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4262318 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4262319 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4262320 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4262321 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4262322 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4262323 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4262324 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4262325 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4262326 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4262327 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4262328 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4262329 because of the suspicious nature of the death and the unidentified substance it leads to a lot of questions
4262330 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4262331 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4262332 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4262333 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions

4262339 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4262340 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4262341 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4262342 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4262343 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end

4262365 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4262366 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4262367 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4262368 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4262369 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4262461 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4262462 believed to conduct financial transactions for aqi and its car bombing networks
4262463 refused to comply with their instructions and made threatening movements toward them

4262466 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
4262467 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
4262468 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
4262469 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
4262470 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
4262471 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
4262472 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
4262473 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag
4262474 it looks like they got away with it scot free
4262475 and that the so called loyal bushies that they stuffed into these positions will also have gotten away with it and will be there essentially indefinitely protected by civil service protections that they dont deserve
4262476 the administration supports efforts to encourage adults who smoke to choose to quit and to prevent children from ever using tobacco products
4262477 in seeking to limit the harm imposed by tobacco on the american public the bill will unfortunately undermine one of the nations premier public health and regulatory institutions and potentially lead the public to mistakenly conclude some tobacco products are safe
4262478 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
4262479 it looks like they got away with it scot free
4262480 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially
4262481 that should bring the year over year number down a bit
4262482 the markets focus has shifted to the economy and how much it is contracting and not how much things cost a month ago
4262483 was lower than the previous weeks revision it still indicates that employment opportunities are getting fewer and fewer
4262484 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft
4262485 because i could watch you eat ice cream all day

4262490 those persons are to tell the truth much more numerous than people generally suppose and a subject like that of the concentration camp world well designed alas to stimulate sado masochistic imaginings offered them an exceptional field of action we have known numerous mentally damaged persons half swindlers and half fools who exploited an imaginary deportation we have known others of them authentic deportees whose sick minds strove to go even beyond the monstrosities that they had seen or that people said happened to them there have been publishers to print som of their imaginings and more or less official compilations to use them but publishers and compilers are absolutely inexcusable since the most elementary inquiry would have been enough to reveal the imosture

4262494 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4262495 because there is a general feeling our here that the government is substantially underestimating future demand for energy
4262496 i think there is a failure on the part of the greens not necessarily just the green party to recognise that economic well being is important for environmental wellbeing
4262497 my concern with the labour party and the green party approach is that they are putting their ideological aversion to fossil fuels and hydro electric generation ahead of a rational approach to security of electricity of supply and the contribution of electricity to economic growth
4262498 conservation of flora and fauna amp environmental protection cost money for that we need to be making money
4262499 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4262500 we failed in two areas not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process

4262506 we have had quite a few e mails from people suggesting other people to include or to include themselves
4262507 society wannabes are the kinds of people who want to be on the list they desperately want to be taken seriously
4262508 there were people who just really objected to it found it invasive and were unhappy that we listed where they lived or the names of their kids or put up satellite imagery of their house in the hamptons

4262513 es una pregunta dif cil para nosotros los cristianos por qui n votar soy estadounidense soy latino y soy cristiano
4262514 lo que s s es que ning n partido puede dar por sentado que tiene nuestro voto
4262515 el voto latino cat lico sigue siendo primordialmente dem crata pero el evang lico con george w bush en 2004 se inclin fuertemente por el partido republicano
4262516 yo s c mo es su coraz n y lo que siente sobre los hispanos y los inmigrantes
4262517 en cuatro elecciones anteriores apoy otra plataforma partido pero este a o decid apoyar a obama porque l representa el cambio que nuestro pa s necesita y con l tendremos una voz y un voto
4262518 yo francamente no me siento plenamente identificado con ninguno con los dem cratas por su postura pro aborto y con los republicanos por su actitud hacia los inmigrantes
4262519 no tenemos que estar de acuerdo con todo lo que piense un presidente no es un pastor ni un papa es un jefe de gobierno

4262523 desde las cinco de la ma ana hasta por lo menos once de la noche en la asamblea de dios iglesia verdad y vida se practican ritos religiosos a altos niveles de ruido
4262524 el ruido que puede producir la manifestaci n personal o colectiva de un credo puede en muchos casos perturbar derechos de terceros y por consiguiente ser un factor que trastorne la paz la tranquilidad la intimidad e incluso a largo plazo la salud y vida de las personas que se ven constantemente expuestas a un desequilibrio del medio ambiente

4262530 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4262531 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it

4262652 we were able to listen to the community to get ideas for this game
4262653 important to be tactical in implementation of what you can do
4262654 an open world opens up tons of possibilities for gamers
4262655 if you choose one branch the other branch dies right
4262656 think of each faction in mercenaries 2 as getting reputation in world of warcraft the content is always there for you to unlock if you want it
4262657 mattias he is an animal he is an anarchist you really have to think of what a crazy guy would say
4262658 the individuals story is how you achieve your goals its when you tell your buddy about how you leveled a city block to eliminate one guy
4262659 it has to be really quiet right before the explosion goes off it is like a musical composition in that way
4262660 i hope so and so isnt on the cover next year
4262661 maybe if madden got back on there there wouldnt be a curse anymore
4262662 a state of the art facility equipped with tinfoil shielding a ventilation system and emergency surge protectors
4262663 is it a good idea to microwave nickel cadmium batteries
4262664 hard shelled tropical treat break the curse of the boring food experiments
4262665 by far the longest time weve ever done for any experiment
4262666 microwaves are like itty bitty destruction derby cars in your own home
4262667 thirty highly action packed plasmatic seconds of on the edge of your seat microwaving mega baboom action like the sun was set free
4262668 in london you cant even buy a potato with the amount of money youre offering me
4262669 you wanna stay alive you better keep your mouth shut
4262670 i want you to start living as a gay woman
4262671 can you make sure all my teachers are in there when you knock it down
4262672 they give me extra homework on the weekends and everything
4262673 forced kids to watch the howard stern show and watch his movie private parts
4262674 march on in there today put it back on your counter and youre gonna give me four dollars and ninety nine cents
4262675 how about if i just come over there and whoop your ass
4262676 this is hurtfully brilliant ive become addicted to this one i listen to it endlessly
4262677 if i hear another word of hebrew i am going to throw up
4262678 every man under my command owes me one hundred nazi scalps and yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of one hundred dead nazis or die trying
4262679 not only am i doing nothing about it i am offended that you would even think to make such a call
4262680 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4262681 welcome to universal studios how is everybody today good good now watch the screen because my good friend hoopi has something to say

4262684 this is my dear friend from new york and she just asked me is this really a catholic church
4262685 ah yes theyre all dead in those new york churches they dont like how i do things here but im going to keep doing it my way welcome
4262686 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before
4262687 well i guess were going to have to shop this around
4262688 what director can we hire that can make a low budget look like a huge studio movie who happens to be connected to amazing talent
4262689 much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes
4262690 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
4262691 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
4262692 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
4262693 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
4262694 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns
4262695 i dont agree you see i dont really view communism as a bad thing
4262696 they carried out cpr for a considerable period of time until advised by ambulance staff that they should desist
4262697 clients relying on publicly funded clinics received a broader scope of sexual and reproductive health care services than those relying on private doctors
4262698 much of the difference is likely attributable to the different needs of clients served by different providers
4262699 trends in u s womens use of sexual and reproductive health care services 1995 2002
4262700 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4262701 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4262702 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4262703 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4262704 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4262705 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4262706 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4262707 hes a great coach he knows what hes doing obviously hes been doing this for a ton of years
4262708 he said you have to go in softer you cant go in hard you cant go in to kill it

4262717 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4262718 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4262719 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4262720 i was like thank god we finally made it through this

4262728 the purchase of pmi in australia and asia is in line with qbes strategy of diversification
4262729 the acquisitions have been structured to allow us to meet or exceed our minimum profit requirements even in the event of extremely adverse economic conditions over the next three years
4262730 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
4262731 australian workers urgently need the rest of work choices to be scrapped and to have their rights to collectively bargain restored

4262748 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
4262749 blaspheming the prophet mohammed and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord

4262813 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
4262814 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4262815 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty

4262817 we dont have terrorist attacks here we dont have suicide bombers and i think thats what people think of when they think about terrorism

4262820 cyanide is a fast acting chemical used in manufacturing metallurgy and pest extermination that when inhaled or ingested prevents the body from processing oxygen it can also be mixed with certain acids to produce extremely lethal cyanide gas according to the department of justice

4262822 points out a blog post from july with a comment by a somali with the same name as the man found dead in denver with a large amount of possible cyanide
4262823 this has all the earmarks of an islamic terrorist planning to release cyanide gas at the democratic national party in denver

4262841 operated the first md 83 on eight flights in airspace it should have been restricted from after maintenance on part of the autopilot system was improperly deferred
4262842 although american mechanics correctly diagnosed the problem they again deferred maintenance under the wrong item of the mel as a result the aircraft operated on four revenue flights without a fully functioning autopilot
4262843 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4262856 lets go a bit farther to determine which conference has the best players when you break it all down the sec leads the way with 137 projected starters for the 2008 nfl season the acc finished second with 121 projected starters the big ten finished third with 105 starters and the big 12 was fourth with 72 projected starters the pac 10 finished with 70 starters the big east has 33 starters and conference usa and the mountain west each has 22 starters

4262863 to get to the other side why did the chicken cross the road
4262864 t he notion that more troops would mean more order i think is not a particularly controversial one
4262865 does john mccain deserve credit for pushing for that increase in u s troops a year or so ago that enabled the reduction in violence right now
4262866 well i dont know if he deserves credit i mean the notion that more troops might lead to more stability i dont think is a controversial one or it shouldnt have been
4262867 the thing that you know im struck by was how the generals who at the beginning of the war told the bush administration that more troops would needed to be do the job and maintain stability they were busted back for saying that
4262868 look our troops do a great job over there that doesnt change the fact that the rationale we were given is wrong and that we need to have a plausible strategy for withdrawing from iraq and i think thats something that the prime minister al maliki has recently said and that is a thats what we need to be focused on what is the strategy for american withdrawal
4262869 but a lot of people believe and you know this that if it had not been for that 30 000 or 40 000 increase in troops the relative quiet or stability thats developed in the al anbar province elsewhere in iraq might not necessarily have taken place and that mccain was out on a limb pushing for that
4262870 this is a sad instance of the civilian leadership making poor decisions while our men and women on the front lines have been performing excellent in the service that they give when theyre there
4262871 what mccain says is he can guarantee that if you end this war the way he wants it to end without a time line to just get the job done to win the u s will never have to go back to iraq but he says if you do it like senator obama is recommending a hard and fast 16 month time line you never know whats going to happen and the u s might down the road have to go back in
4262872 well you know the problem i think wolf with the senators position is he says do it my way no time line lets just have victory
4262873 i think the virtues of a time line is you start to look at facts on the ground what might change that will lead to an appropriate strategy for withdrawal
4262874 but senator mccain hasnt given a timeline he hasnt given a strategy hasnt defined what victory is and i think thats something that the american people and especially men and women in service are entitled to
4262875 mccain says its an important issue right now the u s should be doing it senator obama is not so sure maybe as part of a comprehensive compromise he might go along with it where do you stand personally on offshore oil drilling off the coast of virginia
4262876 in virginia weve taken a position both me as the governor and my legislature that we would like to explore natural gas reserves 50 miles off the coast not yet for drilling or production but for to explore to determine the size of the reserve
4262877 the federal moratorium against offshore drilling on the atlantic coast was the federal governments judgment that the costs outweighed the benefits
4262878 but my position is i think you need to do the exploratory drilling to determine what we have
4262879 now senator obamas position is pretty clear yes as part of a comprehensive plan drilling could be considered as part of it but first lets drill in the nearly 70 million acres of land that has already been leased to oil companies for drilling they have acreages leased already that could do significant good where they are not drilling before we wholesale hand over other acreages to them lets make them in the areas they currently have permission
4262880 it means weve come a long way and we have a ways to go but if he goes into that oval office it will change the way american people think
4262881 i was at the march on washington because i was always involved in civil rights issues
4262882 this is something that i never expected would happen in my lifetime
4262883 a lot of this on my part has to do with how hard it was to obtain the vote especially for african americans and for women i tell my students and family members that people actually died for the right to vote and because people gave their life for it and it is part of connecting with ourselves and our nation then we have to do it i feel compelled to do it because of the historical turmoil that the path to voting has taken for african americans and women over the course of the past two centuries
4262884 im definitely enthused that barack obama is a black man all of my family and my friends are very excited that obama is a black man its like being proud of one of your own
4262885 its an important step for my nation its an important step for my race and im thrilled to death that finally a black candidate is being taken seriously and not just taken seriously but people are excited
4262886 we do see that our nation is making formidable changes for the better and were happy for that but with the historic happenings everything that has gone on that has been particularly discriminatory or racist and then in 2008 to have an african american candidate who can actually land the presidency is just phenomenal
4262887 i remember being this excited about one other candidate in my adult life and that was bill clinton and hes certainly not black but i remember people having that same feeling of energy and the air is sort of charged about a person who is personable and well liked but yet brilliant and thats what obama is and the fact that hes black makes it all the better for me
4262888 sixth district congressman bob goodlatte and other house republicans took to the house floor friday to demand that speaker nancy pelosi reconvene the house of representatives to consider the comprehensive american energy act

4262891 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4262892 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4262893 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 per cent

4262923 i think either of them could try to work with the opposing party to get a solution together
4262924 hes watched this now for 25 years and the key lesson of that political history is the more you say i have to have this or that cant be in it the more likely you are to polarize the debate and the less likely you are to be successful

4262940 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
4262941 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
4262942 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
4262943 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
4262944 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose

4262982 the chinese government wants to cover up the aids problem because they want to focus on economic development
4262983 the aids situation may stay the same for a long time because the chinese government has very little influence to control the sex industry and combat the blood selling problem
4262984 there are a lot of international reporters in beijing now and if we reported that the government is addressing aids that would be fine but if we reported how the aids situation actually was of course the chinese government wouldnt be happy
4262985 its hard to control these industries and the government doesnt work to control sex workers since its good for the economy
4262986 most youths learn through the internet or other publications so the message isnt always accurate
4262987 often hospitals and doctors will refuse to see aids patients

4262994 the author acknowledges with thanks the canada council and the arts council of ontario who proved funds while this book was in progress

4263010 in many cases all candidates have three as and increasingly four as
4263011 some talented pupils do more than three a levels because they enjoy the work and the challenge but you can see how some pupils might think that doing more might make them stand out from those with three as
4263012 in fact they might be disadvantaging themselves by taking the edge off their overall performance by doing so much
4263013 but im sure there are those who think that offering something extra will give them extra credit with universities it wont
4263014 increasingly pupils have opted for four or five as a way of distinguishing themselves from other candidates sixty per cent of our pupils do four a levels for this reason
4263015 my own feeling is that pupils should not be encouraged to do too many a levels because it eats into time that should be devoted to all those other important aspects of an education such as sport public speaking and the performing arts
4263016 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

4263026 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case

4263040 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4263041 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4263042 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4263043 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4263044 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4263045 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4263046 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4263047 jennifers friends think matt planted this false story to get press for himself hes apparently done this kind of thing before

4263086 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4263087 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4263088 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4263093 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4263094 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4263095 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4263112 hiermee schiet margriet hermans wel de hoofdvogel af qua betuttelingdrift open vld beweert dan liberaal te zijn maar wat doe je met een voorstel om de gemeentebesturen te verplichten elke vergunning voor een snoepwinkel of een frituur in de buurt van een schoolpoort te weigeren
4263113 spijtig genoeg is dit niet om te lachen en de politica mag haar mosterd halen in nederland of om het even waar het komt opnieuw neer op meer betutteling van de overheid dat open vld niets over heeft voor de hardwerkende vlaamse middenstander dat voelen de handelaars al jaren in hun portemonnee maar nu nog eens broodroof plegen op snoepwinkels en frituren is een regelrechte schande het is duidelijk dat lijst dedecker politiek alleen staat om de belangen van de middenstanders en de vrijheid van ondernemen te verdedigen maar dat zal ons niet beletten die strijd verder te zetten
4263114 she is very sweet and social she absolutely loves playing with other dogs she is very submissive she is an all around cool puppy she is very active but at the same time she will keep herself busy chewing on her chew toy and you will hardly know that she is there she has caught on to potty training really quickly only one accident in the week that i have had her and she sleeps through the night which as any of you who have ever had a puppy knows is a god send she does get car sick but that seems to be improving the more that she rides in cars

4263130 one thing is certain we delayed our march from alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably
4263131 as we marched through the country of our allies commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents boil kettles and lie down to rest
4263132 the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the black forest
4263133 since the donauw rth action i cannot admire their performances

4263136 yet a battle is absolutely necessary and i rely on the bravery and discipline of the troops which will make amends for our disadvantages
4263137 i could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns
4263138 filling the whole plain from the danube to the woods on the horizon

4263144 they died to a man where they stood stationed right out in the open plain supported by nobody
4263145 that in the position in which he is now he has no command
4263146 which they accepted of and immediately their brigadier de nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms
4263147 i have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the queen and let her know her army has had a glorious victory
4263148 the french lost this battle for a wide variety of reasons for one thing they had too good an opinion of their own ability another point was their faulty field dispositions and in addition there was rampant indiscipline and inexperience displayed it took all these faults to lose so celebrated a battle

4263242 la mayor a de nuestros productos se exportan principalmente a los pa ses rabes los ee uu y am rica latina la verdad es que la venta minorista a los comerciantes nacionales es muy reducida la raz n es muy simple la venta de l mparas decorativas en los mercados extranjeros reporta ganancias decenas de veces superiores a las que obtenemos vendi ndolas en el interior de china no puedo darle datos sobre nuestras exportaciones ya que es un secreto comercial pero s puedo asegurarle que son muy elevadas y rentables
4263243 en solo un mes exportamos veinte o treinta contenedores de zapatos casi todos se exportan a oriente medio y frica con la venta de un par de zapatos las ganancias brutas son muy reducidas en cambio los contratos de venta al por mayor que firmamos con los empresarios extranjeros ascienden a decenas de miles yuanes

4263249 indeniza o sem dano importaria enriquecimento il cito enriquecimento sem causa para quem a recebesse e pena para quem a pagasse porquanto o objetivo da indeniza o sabemos todos reparar o preju zo sofrido pela v tima reintegr la ao estado em que se encontrava antes da pr tica do ato il cito
4263250 conceitua se ent o o dano como sendo a subtra o ou diminui o de um bem jur dico qualquer que seja a sua natureza quer se trate de um bem patrimonial quer se trate de um bem integrante da pr pria personalidade da v tima como a sua honra a imagem a liberdade etc em suma dano les o de um bem jur dico tanto patrimonial como moral vindo da a conhecida divis o do dano em patrimonial e moral
4263251 discute se em que aspecto das situa es jur dicas ele se insere se consiste na viola o do direito subjectivo ou na ofensa ao bem ou na les o disponibilidade deste ou na ofensa ao interesse do titular
4263252 parece nos dentro desta concep o que o preju zo deve ser entendido como
4263253 referimos acima o mecanismo da ofensa les o a situa es vantajosas ora o preju zo s existe quando havendo essa les o o respectivo titular n o consegue na realidade usufruir as utilidades do bem ou s o consegue com maior esfor o hip tese em que o preju zo consiste nesse maior esfor o
4263254 o dano surge assim em rela o a qualquer situa o vantajosa mesmo de facto e n o se reporta necess riamente les o de um direito subjectivo mas s relevante
4263255 deste modo o preju zo n o se confunde com a les o do direito ou em geral da situa o vantajosa se o empreiteiro obrigado a entregar a casa dentro de determinado prazo s vem a faz lo quinze dias mais tarde houve ofensa do direito de cr dito mas pode n o ter havido preju zos v g se o dono da casa que a destinava a sua habita o n o a utilizaria nesse per odo por se encontrar ausente no estrangeiro se algu m danifica ou se apropria de coisa alheia lesa o direito de propriedade mas se a conserta ou restitui antes que dela necessite o dono n o provoca preju zos a este pelo que n o haver responsabilidade civil
4263256 na evolu o normal e portanto prov vel dos acontecimentos
4263257 desde que ao tempo da responsabiliza o j se possam verificar os fatos que com certeza ou com razo vel probabilidade dar o ensejo a preju zos projetados no tempo
4263258 a lei n o afirma expressamente que o preju zo para ser repar vel tenha de apresentar um m nimo de gravidade ou valor mas tal conclus o imposta pelo bom senso e at pelo princ pio da boa f a exig ncia da repara o de um desses preju zos m nimos s poderia explicar se pelo prop sito de vexar o lesante e como tal n o mereceria a tutela do direito
4263259 esse requisito do m nimo de gravidade s poder apreciar se caso a caso pelo prudente arb trio do julgador mas n o significa que apenas sejam repar veis os preju zos de valor elevado tamb m o ser o os pequenos preju zos desde que excedam o referido m nimo e tem de se ter presente que o acto il cito pode revestir car cter continuado e ir provocando preju zos insignificantes cuja acumula o todavia representa grande perda
4263260 a gravidade do dano h de medir se por um padr o objetivo conquanto a aprecia o deva ter em linha de conta as circunst ncias de cada caso e n o luz de fatores subjetivos de uma sensibilidade particularmente embotada ou especialmente requintada por outro lado a gravidade apreciar se em fun o da tutela do direito o dano deve ser de tal modo grave que justifique a concess o de uma satisfa o de ordem pecuni ria ao lesado
4263261 podendo ser reparado sen o diretamente mediante restaura o natural ou reconstitui o espec fica da situa o anterior les o pelo menos indiretamente por meio de equivalente ou indeniza o pecuni ria
4263262 o conjunto de rela es jur dicas de uma pessoa apreci veis em dinheiro
4263263 tradicionalmente define se dano patrimonial como a diferen a entre o que se tem e o que se teria n o fosse o evento danoso a assim chamada teoria da diferen a devida reelabora o de friedrich mommsen converteu o dano numa dimens o matem tica e portanto objetiva e facilmente calcul vel

4263268 n o s da paralisa o da atividade lucrativa ou produtiva da v tima como tamb m da frustra o daquilo que era razoavelmente esperado
4263269 que o lesado tinha no momento da les o um direito ao ganho que se frustrou
4263270 a titularidade de uma situa o jur dica que mantendo se lhe daria direito a esse ganho
4263271 aquilo que o bom senso diz que o credor lucraria apurado segundo um ju zo de probabilidade de acordo com o normal desenrolar dos fatos
4263272 at prova em contr rio admite se que o credor haveria de lucrar aquilo que o bom senso diz que lucraria
4263273 com certa probabilidade era de esperar atendendo ao curso normal das coisas ou s especiais circunst ncias do caso concreto e particularmente s medidas e previs es adotadas
4263274 a doutrina francesa aplicada com freq ncia pelos nossos tribunais fala da perda de uma chance perte dune chance nos casos em que o ato il cito tira da v tima a oportunidade de obter uma situa o futura melhor como progredir na carreira art stica ou no trabalho arrumar um novo emprego deixar de ganhar uma causa pela falha do advogado etc preciso todavia que se trate de uma chance real e s ria que proporcione ao lesado efetivas condi es pessoais de concorrer situa o futura esperada
4263275 a repara o da perda de uma chance repousa em uma probabilidade e uma certeza que a chance seria realizada e que a vantagem perdida resultaria em preju zo
4263276 o lucro frustrado h de ser conseq ncia necess ria da conduta do agente n o bastando que o ato il cito se erija em causa indireta ou remota do dano
4263277 condicionar o lucro cessante a uma probabilidade objetiva resultante do desenvolvimento normal dos acontecimentos conjugados s circunst ncias peculiares do caso concreto
4263278 sempre necess rio que os efeitos decorram e se produzam do ato danoso em rela o ao futuro impedindo ou diminuindo o benef cio patrimonial legitimamente esperado
4263279 o car ter principal desta esp cie de dano o de n o atingir o patrim nio e n o pr priamente o de ser moral
4263280 a todos os bens personal ssimos os complexos de ordem tica
4263281 os direitos honra ao nome intimidade privacidade e liberdade est o englobados no
4263282 luz da constitui o vigente podemos conceituar o dano moral por dois aspectos distintos em sentido estrito dano moral viola o do direito dignidade e foi justamente por considerar a inviolabilidade da intimidade da vida privada da honra e da imagem corol rio do direito dignidade que a constitui o inseriu em seu art 5 v e x a plena repara o do dano moral
4263283 dor ou desgosto que deriva da perda de um ente querido da ofensa corporal que provoca um sofrimento ou deforma o f sica da cal nia que atinge a honra ou a reputa o
4263284 n o decorre da natureza do direito bem ou interesse lesado mas do efeito da les o do car ter de sua repercuss o sobre o lesado
4263285 tanto poss vel ocorrer dano patrimonial em conseq ncia de les o a bem n o patrimonial como dano moral por efeito da ofensa a bem material
4263286 assim no momento atual doutrina e jurisprud ncia dominantes t m como adquirido que o dano moral aquele que independentemente de preju zo material fere direitos personal ssimos isto todo e qualquer atributo que individualiza cada pessoa tal como a liberdade a honra a atividade profissional a reputa o as manifesta es culturais e intelectuais entre outros o dano ainda considerado moral quando os efeitos da a o embora n o repercutam na rbita de seu patrim nio material originam ang stia dor sofrimento tristeza ou humilha o v tima trazendo lhe sensa es e emo es negativas

4263288 enquanto ser humano ser detentora de um conjunto de bens integrantes de sua personalidade mais precioso que o patrim nio a
4263289 os direitos da personalidade entretanto englobam outros aspectos da pessoa humana que n o est o diretamente vinculados sua dignidade nessa categoria incluem se tamb m os chamados novos direitos da personalidade a imagem o bom nome a reputa o sentimentos rela es afetivas aspira es h bitos gostos convic es pol ticas religiosas filos ficas direitos autorais em suma os direitos da personalidade podem ser realizados em diferentes dimens es e tamb m podem ser violados em diferentes n veis resulta da que o dano moral em sentido amplo envolve esses diversos graus de viola o dos direitos da personalidade abrange todas as ofensas pessoa considerada esta em suas dimens es individual e social ainda que sua dignidade n o seja arranhada
4263290 dor vexame sofrimento ou humilha o que fugindo normalidade interfira intensamente no comportamento psicol gico do indiv duo causando lhe afli es ang stia e desequil brio em seu bem estar
4263291 mero dissabor aborrecimento m goa irrita o ou sensibilidade exarcebada
4263292 tais situa es n o s o intensas e duradouras a ponto de romper o equil brio psicol gico do indiv duo

4263294 de fato n o ser toda e qualquer situa o de sofrimento tristeza transtorno ou aborrecimento que ensejar a repara o mas apenas aquelas situa es graves o suficiente para afetar a dignidade humana em seus diversos substratos materiais j identificados quais sejam a igualdade a integridade psicof sica a liberdade e a solidariedade familiar ou social no plano extrapatrimonial em sentido estrito
4263295 com a obriga o pecuni ria imposta ao causador do dano sendo esta mais uma satisfa o do que uma indeniza o
4263296 deformidades f sicas que provocam aleij o e repugn ncia
4263297 casos de marcas e outros defeitos f sicos que causem v tima desgosto ou complexo de inferioridade
4263298 em raz o da sua gravidade e da intensidade do sofrimento que perdura no tempo o dano moral deve ser arbitrado em quantia mais expressiva quando a v tima sofre deformidade f sica

4263302 o consentimento do titular da imagem n o constitui ren ncia porque aquele n o produz a extin o do direito e tem um destinat rio favorecido por seus efeitos quando se consente na utiliza o de um direito tal consentimento dado a pessoa ou pessoas determinadas sem que por isso se queira produzir a extin o do direito essas pessoas poder o legitimamente fazer uso desse direito como por exemplo a imagem de outrem sem que haja nisso qualquer les o
4263303 for utilizada de forma humilhante vexat ria desrespeitosa acarretando dor vergonha e sofrimento ao seu titular
4263304 embora despida de certos direitos que s o pr prios da personalidade humana tais como a integridade f sica ps quica e da sa de titular de alguns direitos especiais da personalidade ajust veis s suas caracter sticas particulares tais como o bom nome a imagem a reputa o o sigilo de correspond ncia etc

4263307 assim por exemplo na elabora o do chamado dano institucional nada impediria que se levasse em considera o as condi es econ micas da v tima ou que se pensasse em termos de aposi o de tetos indenizat rios ou ainda que o delineamento dos lucros cessantes nesse caso fosse uma categoria espec fica que teria por base a imagem institucional de que a empresa ou era detentora h in meras vantagens em se diferenciar no mbito da responsabilidade civil a pessoa jur dica da pessoa humana especialmente no que tange especial ssima tutela de qu s esta ltima credora

4263312 compensa o ou benef cio de ordem material a nica poss vel que lhe permite obter prazeres ou distrac es porventura de ordem puramente espiritual que de algum modo atenuem a sua dor
4263313 deve ser suficiente para reparar o dano o mais completamente poss vel e nada mais qualquer quantia a maior importar enriquecimento sem causa ensejador de novo dano
4263314 se a indeniza o em termos gerais n o pode ter o objetivo de provocar o enriquecimento ou proporcionar ao ofendido um avantajamento por mais forte raz o deve ser eq itativa a repara o do dano moral para que se n o converta o sofrimento em m vel de capta o de lucro
4263315 creio tamb m que este o outro ponto onde o princ pio da l gica do razo vel deve ser a b ssola norteadora do julgador razo vel aquilo que sensato comedido moderado que guarda uma certa proporcionalidade a razoabilidade o crit rio que permite cotejar meios e fins causas e conseq ncias de modo a aferir a l gica da decis o para que a decis o seja razo vel necess rio que a conclus o nela estabelecida seja adequada aos motivos que a determinaram que os meios escolhidos sejam compat veis com os fins visados que a san o seja proporcional ao dano importa dizer que o juiz ao valorar o dano moral deve arbitrar uma quantia que de acordo com o seu prudente arb trio seja compat vel com a reprovabilidade da conduta il cita a intensidade e dura o do sofrimento experimentado pela v tima a capacidade econ mica do causador do dano as condi es sociais do ofendido e outras circunst ncias mais que se fizerem presentes

4263427 im writing a book im trying to start a potential new career in standup comedy its difficult i use the fact that ive been in the business for 15 years as part of my routine in fact one of the jokes i do in there is i say i was talking to a friend of mine and i told him i was going to try to do standup comedy and he said to me well wont you be nervous i said well lets think about this ive been getting naked and having sex in front of strangers and a camera for 15 years i think i can handle this yeah so thats one of my actual lines in my standup bit
4263428 he dropped in and did about 20 minutes so thats always cool
4263429 ive been meeting some good comedians and im keeping my fingers crossed that one of them notices me and wants me for a movie ive met a lot of them and theyre like hey i know you that sort of thing and i say thank you very much part of my bit is how my recognition has changed throughout the years people used to give me what i used to call the look which is a kind of thing where they look at me with this quizzical look and they figure out who i am and they run away
4263430 that was mostly guys in the early part of my career but now that porns become a little more pop culture a little more accepted now people will come up and talk to me
4263431 so i have a slight advantage because when they see me and they know who i am they want to hear what i have to say
4263432 i think the last time i had a major script in my hand was something i did for jonathan over at wicked a non sex role
4263433 i dont remember what the movie was i dont even remember who starred i just remember she was a little fireball and she was really sweet but the b j stuff helps pay the bills a lot of people they go are you still working if youre still hiring yeah im still working but ive got to go somewhere else its time to head toward other horizons
4263434 its basically about how the pill has changed the industry and basically how it cost me my career
4263435 i was one of the 25 guys in this industry who could naturally perform and once the pharmaceutical companies came out with the ed drugs pretty much almost everybody could do my job so thats why the book is called from a skill to a pill because basically thats whats happened its basically my views on how the industry has changed in the time ive been in it
4263436 you might remember nasty natasha she also went by eden later on in her career
4263437 now this is 1 30 in the morning so i said oh im sorry im sorry my mistake she goes well you havent talked to cindy in quite a while have you i go no its been over a year she said oh because i just got this phone number today i thought it was kind of funny it was ringing i said oh well once again im sorry i tried to back out of it
4263438 so natasha goes well what were you going to say to her and im like well uh well uh so i told her well um i tried to dance around it and she goes you were going to talk sex werent you i said well uh it was kind of you know it was a possibility she goes tell me what you were going to say now im thinking this is some kind of set up at this point right im going im not going to jail im just going to hang up now she goes no no its okay tell me i said well ill tell you what ill give you my phone number you call me back and ill tell you whatever you want to hear because if somebody calls you you can say whatever you want
4263439 so i gave her my number and she called me right back and we had phone sex
4263440 so i went out and actually got the movies and i watched them and of course her voice was so distinctive when the scene came up im looking at naughty little natasha and going holy shit
4263441 so she turned to me and she said well i honestly think you could do this if you wanted to she obviously saw something in me that i didnt know existed other than the fact that ive been horny since i was 5 but she said you know i think you could i go okay she says no no not that fast i said yeah it figures she says i really want you to think about this this is pre aim 101 aims video for new performers and this is something i write about in my book she asked me to take a week off to think about what i was getting into and i did and i think everybody when you come into this industry you should be sent away for a week sit down with an agent sit down with a producer sit down with whoever you want to sit down with go through all the paperwork set it all up dont sign anything but research what youre getting into and dont make a snap judgment on this take some time off to think about it
4263442 and i did i actually waited a week and i thought about how family was going to react how friends would react
4263443 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of

4263459 we found 10 compounds that did selectively bind to the parasite enzyme and not the human version
4263460 it turns out that those 10 compounds do actually inhibit parasite growth

4263493 its more than a feeling when i hear that old song they used to play
4263494 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4263499 married men are working more than 40 hours a week time pressures are increasing our social life is diminishing and we are less connected to our community and family than we have ever been
4263500 are the major reasons mothers are picking up after everyone else they have just got too much on
4263501 in addition we have evidence that clearly shows detective white was not under duress during the incident as he claimed where he made obscene jokes about the situation and discussed how newsworthy it would be these tapes show that this is all about politics and perpetuating a media circus and beginning tomorrow we will start fighting back in court and proving our case
4263502 for these embedded reporters when they have already made clear what their point of view is and which side theyre supporting
4263503 t he back to iraq trip wasnt put together by the
4263504 if essentially you have reporters who are the founders and the activists in the organization then getting credentialed and going with preconceptions and then going out and campaigning thats highly questionable and that deserves scrutiny it seems to me that to some extent the question is is there any chance that any of them change their views or is it simply a kind of a fraud

4263509 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4263510 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4263511 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4263512 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4263513 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4263514 if i were to return my iphone now i would wait until february 2009 to buy it again after next month apple needs to ramp up for year end holiday sales there is no window of time available to redesign the 3g circuitry replace all the existing 3g iphones and build up adequate inventories for the holidays holiday sales are too valuable to risk an inventory shortage if a recall is advised i expect that it wont be issued until 2009
4263515 this is definitely going to be a wait and see

4263548 detecting heteroplasmic mtdna mutations in greater than 1 in 200 individuals of the background population has implications for studies reporting mtdna mutations in specific disease groups our data show that putative disease associations such as the reported high frequency of m 3243a g in diabetes mellitus could be a chance finding irrelevant to pathogenesis
4263549 since the disease associated with these mtdna mutations lhon is manifested in early adult life it is curious that none of the mothers was reported to have a mitochondrial disorder especially since one of the authors patrick chinnery is an expert on is only clinically apparent in 50 of the males and 15 of the females with the mutation still with 100 of their mtdna showing the mutation it is curious that none of them manifested the disease
4263550 our data show that putative disease associations such as the reported high frequency of m 3243ag in diabetes mellitus could be a chance finding irrelevant to pathogenesis
4263551 this makes option 4 very plausible it would be an incredible coincidence if this child just happened to have a mutation in a gene that was known to cause their exact constellation of neurological signs and symptoms and yet the mutation was not the sole or primary cause of those symptoms
4263552 ultimately a metabolic disorder specifically a mitochondrial disorder was suspected and ultimately confirmed through genetic testing which showed
4263553 salvatore dimauro who has studied links between autism and mitochondrial mutations at columbia university in new york agrees
4263554 my guess is that if she had a mitochondrial mutation sooner or later she would have shown something abnormal

4263601 on october 10 2006 comm davis signed a memorandum discussing the transition away from the organization of m r dinsmore chief executive officer of the port of seattle the memorandum appears to assure dinsmore up to a full years pay upon his resignation from the port no dispute exists as to the existence of this memorandum and that comm davis signed it
4263602 we find when read as a whole the petition is legally sufficient in charging comm davis with an act of malfeasance by signing an october 10 2006 memorandum addressed to then chief executive officer of the port of seattle dinsmore which had the potential effect of obligating the port of seattle to pay dinsmore an outgoing port of seattle employee at least 239 000 outside of his employment contract additionally we find these additional moneys were not voted on or approved by the port of seattle commissioners at a regularly scheduled public hearing and conclude charge one of the ballot synopsis is legally sufficient

4263638 in the event of a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare
4263639 given the national emergency we believe it would be unwise
4263640 every administration has indicated that they have serious concerns about flaws
4263641 authorizes the president to fix an alternative level of locality based comparability payments if the president considers the level that would otherwise be payable inappropriate

4263643 i am pleased to announce the appointment of carol haave as assistant secretary for international affairs at the department of homeland security
4263644 carol is a skilled international negotiator with more than 25 years of combined experience in national security and international affairs
4263645 provided a real steady hand for all the blocking and tackling thats necessary for all the challenges of management of human capital at opm
4263646 while we have not always agreed with ms springers initiatives we did see more willingness to engage employee representatives under her tenure
4263647 i think from a people standpoint its reconnecting all the opm associates around the country to the washington office the directors office really needed to make the effort to physically get out to visit people listen to them find ways for them on a routine basis to give their input and be heard and responded to it had really become fragmented in my judgment in the human capital surveys the best places to work surveys opm had slipped now were having a resurgence and were really one agency again
4263648 were certainly turning around our background investigations much faster than we did three years ago we are making inroads in processing new retirement claims even though we have had a pause in our modernization work
4263649 we believe that it continues to be a serious issue so what are we doing obviously you do things at the front end as well as at the retention end were doing more in the way of reaching out to schools and recruiting weve done things that will speed up the hiring process were testing various things that will cut down on the paperwork and the time it takes to process we have now three times the number of applications per job announcement on usajobs which is the main online portal to getting federal jobs
4263650 i think its improved in some cases but i wouldnt say significantly we have a project going right now thats looking end to end at the entire hiring process to see what the standard should be and what the best practice agencies are doing were also testing pilots cutting down and eliminating a lot of paperwork that has to be filled out by the applicant and then reviewed by the agency another pilot lets develop a common job description that can be used for all the agencies for common positions such as accountants if someone applies they dont have to answer five sets of questions to be considered for an accountant position at five different agencies
4263651 we were hopeful we could have seen the passage of the re employed annuitant legislation that would have allowed annuitants from federal positions the ability to come back and serve their country again without having to in effect have an offset between the salary for their new work against their pension for their former work which is just unfair thats probably the biggest one
4263652 i think the gs system is obsolete and its time for a new system that includes pay for performance
4263653 theres a lot of potential for bulk wine because of the bulk harvest
4263654 in recent years exports of bulk wine from new zealand have been around 4 5 percent of total exports
4263655 after a good vintage a winery may have a bit more wine than it can sell so it will go into bulk wholesale between wineries
4263656 there was a lot of debate in the early 1990s that bulk would be bad for the industry but evidence to date is sales of those products has not damaged the reputation of the industry
4263657 what it has done is expose different drinkers to our sauvignon blanc
4263658 in terms of bulk wine trade compared to prices a year ago yes its cheap but bulk imports to new zealand have been as low as 50c to 60c litre
4263659 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4263660 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november

4263673 it has a really mean tone i wanted to try something new on the 7 string i used with korn the strings were kind of wobbly
4263674 it tore my fingers up a bit it seemed like it had more beef and meatiness
4263675 he had two and he lent me one they are cool guitars
4263676 i found that sound and went for it it is a pretty heavy record there are no mellow songs on the album
4263677 i didnt want to experiment further i found the sound for the record
4263678 i track four or five rhythm guitars we would get tones bring them up get that bitey sound

4263692 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4263693 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4263694 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4263695 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4263696 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4263697 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4263698 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4263699 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4263700 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4263701 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4263702 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4263703 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4263704 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4263705 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4263706 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4263708 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4263709 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4263710 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4263711 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4263712 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4263713 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4263714 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4263715 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4263716 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4263717 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4263718 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4263719 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4263720 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4263721 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4263722 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4263723 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4263724 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4263725 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4263726 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4263727 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4263728 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4263729 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4263730 we are quite pleased with gulf resources results for the second quarter and the first half of 2008 the strong growth in revenue and net income was the result of the contribution of the five new bromine producing properties acquired in 2007 and early 2008
4263731 we have also added additional capacity in our chemical segment that enables gulf to serve chinas expanding demand for environmentally friendly chemical compounds
4263732 we plan to build upon our solid results in the first half of the year and will continue to seek opportunities to expand our business both through acquisitions and increased operating efficiencies demand for bromine remains strong and we expect that this will continue to be the major area of growth for our company in the future
4263733 we have also been actively seeking opportunities in our chemical segment and our new capacity will enable us to cater to the increasing demand for environmentally friendly chemical compounds we feel that gulf resources is well positioned to continue to grow our revenue and net income ultimately increasing value for our shareholders
4263734 we anticipate being able to substantially grow skypostal in the second half through several targeted acquisitions introduction of service to europe introduction of new mailing solutions to lac for internet marketers and the roll out of our gps pda units which will provide skypostal with a decidedly unique advantage over the state owned public postal networks by offering automatic confirmation of delivery on mail at a fraction of the cost charged by express operators
4263735 we are pleased to receive such high praise from the industry
4263736 and we have many more innovative health and wellness products in our pipeline
4263737 we appreciate the warm welcome from this exciting and vibrant industry were looking forward to upcoming industry events and future product introductions
4263738 since the impact of marriage and family stems beyond the personal realm and reaches far into the public and societal spheres then governments should not attempt to redefine the historical understanding of marriage but rather endorse it support it and enact policies to strengthen it
4263739 ive always said that in the right situation to have three pro bowl corners is a great thing we had it in the past with troy vincent bobby taylor and al harris it can work out we will see soon how it irons out if lito is here that is a potentially great secondary to put on the field
4263740 no doubt especially when i feel like i should be getting treated a certain way and im not that shows a little disappreciation so to say
4263741 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4263742 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4263743 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4263744 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4263745 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4263746 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4263747 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4263748 who are open to doing something on the production side
4263749 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4263750 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4263751 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4263752 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4263753 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4263754 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4263755 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4263756 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4263757 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4263758 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4263759 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4263760 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4263761 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4263762 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4263763 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4263764 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4263765 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4263766 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4263767 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4263768 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4263769 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4263770 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4263771 it was immediately apparent that the move to summer 2009 offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4263772 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4263773 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4263774 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4263775 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4263776 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4263777 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4263778 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4263779 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4263780 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4263781 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4263782 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4263783 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4263784 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4263785 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4263786 id like to introduce more women and children to the sport thats my main mission my main goal i want to do as much as i can to save these ranges because thats our future
4263787 he has a strategic vision and strong management skills and is highly respected for his participative management style he has established a strong presence in the riverside community as a good listener and an innovative problem solver consensus builder and a person who gets things done
4263788 on behalf of our entire community i offer gratitude and congratulations to interim city manager bernard melekian who has demonstrated during the last nine months his standing as one of californias finest public officials
4263789 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4263790 government mandates are reshaping the esc market creating new opportunities and risks for the supply chain
4263791 escs transition from an expensive optional feature to a standard function in the space of just a few years will yield openings for newcomers and pose threats to established second tier suppliers the huge and highly visible growth opportunity in esc sensors will make for an interesting battleground as prices are driven down by increased competition and tier one suppliers gain a wider choice of suppliers
4263792 were very proud of the accomplishments of these outstanding young people it takes a great deal of discipline and hard work to achieve this level of success their dedication brings honor to them and to our community
4263793 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4263794 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4263795 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4263796 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4263797 og s ladies da hald meg r sk meg dra meg opp og ned i mente i trrrrruso
4263798 det inneb r att vi verl ter ansvaret p skolledningen
4263799 vi skolan och byggbranschen har alla varit verens om att elevantalet p byggprogrammet ska vara lika stort oavsett konjunktur det r redan nu sv rt att f praktikplatser till alla elever trots h gkonjunktur
4263800 come on man couldnt you have given him just a little dimensionality as a character just a little
4263801 but in recent years the era of round the clock cable news blogs and youtube elections ceased to be merely an insult to our intelligence and became an ever present menace battering our senses with a daily deluge of insipid arguments about nothing
4263802 this universal resemblance is a mysterious property of second hand shops age and use make everything look similarly faded and people are remarkably consistent in what they cull from their lives baby paraphernalia obsolete technology outdated fashions and novels by james michener
4263803 if and when that happens then we will address it
4263804 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4263805 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4263806 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4263807 coas commitment to maintaining the highest level of standards and quality improvement is designed to identify providers that have set high performance standards for themselves and have made a commitment to their constituents to deliver the highest quality services
4263808 we congratulate rosemary childrens services for their hard work and wonderful achievement and are proud to have rcs as part of coas community of excellence
4263809 programs must also be administered by a skilled and supportive workforce committed to treating all who seek help with dignity and respect
4263810 we are especially pleased to receive this accreditation because coa reviews the entire organization from its board of directors and community partners to its staff and recipients
4263811 ive always said that were a winning team at rosemary childrens services we work together to achieve spectacular results this coa accreditation more than supports that claim
4263812 this poll shows that voters are tired of dreier s knee jerk support for president bush
4263813 voters in this district are ready to elect someone who pursues an agenda of fiscal and diplomatic responsibility this poll makes clear that they believe russ warner is the candidate more likely to deliver on the issues they care about
4263814 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4263815 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4263816 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4263817 if i were to return my iphone now i would wait until february 2009 to buy it again after next month apple needs to ramp up for year end holiday sales there is no window of time available to redesign the 3g circuitry replace all the existing 3g iphones and build up adequate inventories for the holidays holiday sales are too valuable to risk an inventory shortage if a recall is advised i expect that it wont be issued until 2009
4263818 this is definitely going to be a wait and see
4263819 they say a fix is on the way but lets see if the fix works
4263820 in the absence of love there is loneliness sorrow and desperation and thats where i come in
4263821 onstage in san francisco like no record before or since gentlemen is fraught with the psychological warfare bedroom drama catholic guilt reprehensible deception and uncleansable shame that coincide with relationships gone seriously wrong this story explores what happens when intellectual sophistication is star crossed with outspoken braggadocio a charismatic mixture that managed to alienate the mainstream horde and arms folded indie scenesters while for good measure incited outsider jealousy and condescending rumors advanced by the fat greg dulli zine in addition to dissecting the records organization arrangements and lyrics as well as examining old articles reviews and interviews this book delves into the memories experiences and influences of the afghan whigs most notably those that drive dulli a polarizing frontman whose fierce pretentiousness gq appearance and gloves off boisterousness concealed deep rooted mental depression and chemical dependency
4263822 its so clear to me its a diplomatic blackmail and military blackmail
4263823 lo ltimo que tuve conocimiento es que la direcci n de inteligencia militar dim que es el organismo por la parte militar que tiene ingerencia directa sobre esto estaba en guadualito localidad fronteriza
4263824 hasta el momento no se ve ni siquiera como un incidente de m xima importancia porque entre otras cosas no portaban armas si portaran armas ser a otra cosa
4263825 un oficial del ej rcito colombiano que pase a venezuela sin autorizaci n de alguna manera al ser detectado por nosotros tenemos que actuar como nosotros tambi n a veces por equivocaci n o por una mala praxis de cualquiera de nuestros oficiales pasa al otro lado y tambi n es detectado de alguna manera hay una violaci n y es llamado para que informe
4263826 hemos solicitado al gobierno venezolano informaci n sobre el particular la informaci n que yo tengo es que fueron retenidos por el ej rcito venezolano pero no sabemos m s
4263827 esto es una ruta que normalmente se transita por parte de los colombianos porque es m s r pida es m s segura y seguramente por tratarse de estas personas que dos son en uniforme el ej rcito venezolano est haciendo las averiguaciones correspondientes
4263828 los contactos con las farc los tenemos todos los d as con las delegaciones que tenemos en el terreno es obvio que el tema del emblema fue debatido con ellos y fuerzas p blicas de colombia
4263829 no se afect la relaci n con el gobierno de colombia pero el uso del emblema es una violaci n al derecho internacional humanitario pero debemos mantener contactos con el gobierno civil y las fuerzas armadas
4263830 una segunda vuelta para la unidad una segunda oportunidad para la unidad no echemos la unidad a un lado no digamos que no se pudo eso no es excusa s hay tiempo s podemos llegar a la unidad
4263831 solamente unidos podremos ganar de lo contrario tendremos distintos candidatos y llegaremos al 23 de noviembre con una estrategia que fracasar el d a de las elecciones si vamos unidos con un mensaje coherente para todos los caraque os podremos alcanzar esta victoria
4263832 hay que hablarle a los oficialistas a lo no alineados a los que se identifican con la oposici n porque los gobiernos que deben sustituir a los gobiernos fracasados tienen que ser gobiernos que le hablen a todos los caraque os con una propuesta incluyente y tolerante
4263833 todos fuimos testigos de una campa a feroz de los principales medios de comunicaci n en contra del pa s y las relaciones internacionales comandada por miguel henrique otero director del diario
4263834 a estos lacayos del imperio estados unidos no les interesa el pa s ya que el nico que gana con la no uni n y la no consolidaci n de la integraci n de am rica latina es el imperio y para eso trabajan esos lacayos
4263835 dos hombres armados que iban en una motocicleta dispararon hiriendo a tres participantes y a la psic loga que conduc a el taller sicosocial al que asist an cerca de 17 desmovilizados
4263836 es absolutamente inaceptable que quienes se est n esforzando por superar sus errores del pasado se conviertan en blanco de ataques y por eso el gobierno reitera su compromiso de continuar apoyando y respaldando a los participantes que siguen en el proceso de reintegraci n
4263837 hace un par de meses el presidente evo morales les dijo a sus ministros que su objetivo era alcanzar el 65 por ciento de aprobaci n en las urnas para su ratificaci n el presidente ha demostrado que su olfato y experiencia pol tica valen m s que todos los sondeos de opini n y encuestas realizados pocos d as antes del 10 de agosto
4263838 sigo buscando a la clase media urbana que lo iba a castigar a la hora del voto y sigo sin encontrarla los resultados del domingo son un rotundo desmentido a las finalmente err neas conjeturas de una oposici n partidaria extraviada y sin norte que anunciaba la ca da del gobierno

4263840 projects clicking on the button makes the preloader show up but its at 0 0 of the stage and not within my button anymore i tried setting the preloader back to default on the projects page which is the reason for question 1
4263841 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4263842 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4263843 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4263844 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4263845 in many cases all candidates have three as and increasingly four as
4263846 some talented pupils do more than three a levels because they enjoy the work and the challenge but you can see how some pupils might think that doing more might make them stand out from those with three as
4263847 in fact they might be disadvantaging themselves by taking the edge off their overall performance by doing so much
4263848 but im sure there are those who think that offering something extra will give them extra credit with universities it wont
4263849 increasingly pupils have opted for four or five as a way of distinguishing themselves from other candidates sixty per cent of our pupils do four a levels for this reason
4263850 my own feeling is that pupils should not be encouraged to do too many a levels because it eats into time that should be devoted to all those other important aspects of an education such as sport public speaking and the performing arts
4263851 the ground breaking open skies agreement allows european carriers to fly to anywhere in the u s and vice versa
4263852 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices
4263853 amr just wants to be on par with star and sky alliances
4263854 and with open skies giving the ability to buy slots at heathrow one would think there is now a better chance of this getting approved
4263855 changed regulatory world where heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the u s and where rival alliances have immunity
4263856 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4263857 virgin understandably sees a threat in the two largest airlines from both sides of the pond linking up
4263858 corporate clients tend to negotiate with alliances with regional flying destinations virgin is not part of an alliance and its getting harder for them to compete
4263859 affordability is at an all time low and like with alcohol that just leads people to use more or stronger drugs whether it is a student using skunk a form of cannabis that is ten times stronger than the typical joint or a city workers cocaine binge
4263860 the rise in admissions can also be explained by using multiple drugs in greater quantities or purity all this will have an effect on your health
4263861 overall class a drug use has stabilised with the exception of cocaine which has risen over the past ten years as prices have fallen and is responsible for increases in hospital admissions for overdoses
4263862 these alarming figures reveal a wasted generation how many more lives will be lost before the government takes effective action we need better education and more powers to tackle the dealers who profit from this misery
4263863 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
4263864 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
4263865 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
4263866 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
4263867 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose
4263868 obviously because canadians are such high users of voice its a pretty good indicator that we do like to talk
4263869 we have a substantial backlog of new business launching in the power train group in all of north america europe and asia which is so far doing a good job of offsetting the negative sales effect
4263870 total business wins on new fuel efficient transmission platforms such as six speed and dual flex transmissions have reached in excess of 780 million in annual sales
4263871 the decrease in net earnings from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower revenues as a result of a general downturn in the automotive industry the impact of the american axle strike and reduced volumes on north american truck and large sport utility platforms
4263872 incremental production sales were also offset by customer pricing pressures that continue to be a normal part of the north american automotive parts industry
4263873 i am very pleased with our second quarter performance in the face of a very difficult economy and automotive environment
4263874 although our financial performance in terms of revenues and profits was down our profitability in todays market is a reflection of our operational efficiency and continuous improvement
4263875 hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned in so thats all that matters but i wouldnt be sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4263876 we love gareth we want him to stay and hopefully he does
4263877 we just try to get on with it if gareths there im happy if hes not there one day i will be disappointed but good luck to him
4263878 so you can choose performance over energy savings or vice versa
4263879 if you cant dazzle them with brillance baffle them with bullshit
4263880 real document treated in such a way as to appear to be a forgery
4263881 i think that the evidence they were given was either a a copy in fact the copy of his original certificate of live birth or b a us passport based on that certificate
4263882 my mind is made up dont confuse me with facts
4263883 there are many theories floating around in the blogosphere most of them either defy occams razor or are factually or legally inaccurate and one should beware of them
4263884 senator obama should step down now from seeking the presidency and submit himself to some form of legal inquiry on a voluntary basis and before he is compelled so to do he should also apologize to the american people and to his own followers
4263885 he and his zombie followers attack the character of anyone who dares to express doubt many of the most vicious attacks were directed at yours truly no amount of ad hominem argumentation can change facts if a forger covers up type with a chunk of background pattern that my friends is it those old pixels are gone forever you can play with photoshop or some other imaging app you can use every damned toy in the batcave but you will not tease the original text back into legibility you may uncover evidence that a cut n paste job took place but photoshop wont give you a crowbar capable of prying up the concrete flooring to see what lies beneath
4263886 larry johnson susan unpc and texas darlin the biggest a holes since markos moulitsas
4263887 these scoundrels published a fake story they endorsed the fake wholeheartedly on their site and on the radio they did not double check it even though techdude wrote as though any mere child could follow his loopy instructions and recapitulate his results johnson surely knows people in the cia or elsewhere who could have performed a competent analysis but no such analysis occurred johnson and company did not show any of the skepticism that any decent journalist would have displayed they refused to budge when the problems were pointed out to them
4263888 indeed despite promises of a final final final report techdude didnt deliver the goods leaving a bunch of blogs with virtual egg or worse on their faces
4263889 the fact is techdud was apparently the only one forging in this entire mess as he cherry picked random normal anomalies from printers scanners and jpeg sw to find obamas sisters name in the noise he was not a technical expert on computers at best
4263890 a spokesman for indonesias ministry of religious affairs said claims that obama studied at an islamic school are groundless
4263891 sdn menteng 1 is a public primary school that is open to people of all faiths
4263892 moreover he studied earlier at fransiskus assisi which is clearly a catholic school
4263893 interviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends show that obama was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia despite being listed as a muslim on the registration form for the catholic school strada asisia where he attended 1st through 3rd grades at the time the school most likely registered children based on the religion of their fathers said darmawan obamas former teacher because soetoro was a muslim obama was listed as a muslim she said the enrollment form from the catholic school which has been cited as evidence that obama was a muslim in indonesia also was rife with errors it listed obama as an indonesian listed his previous school incorrectly and failed to list his mother ann at all
4263894 we are not the ones insulting muslims in fact we feel badly that one of the largest religions in the world is being insulted by a leading contender for the us presidency so much for unity
4263895 we assert that he was a muslim based primarily on his own memoirs and his own sisters statements as well as documentation from indonesia
4263896 hes bad because he claims being a muslim is a smear but we believe he was one anyway so hes bad for hiding it
4263897 all new critical information about the secrets of making money with clickbank can be in your hands in minutes
4263898 los pol ticos saben que somos muchos y por eso nos quieren cooptar nosotros ponemos el o do con todos pero apoyamos a la presidenta
4263899 tenemos dos patas el diputado edgardo depetri que es nuestro padrino pol tico y la iglesia evang lica
4263900 vengan ac al ministerio nosotros estamos en la oficina 402
4263901 es un lugar que nos prestan porque tenemos buena relaci n con el gobierno
4263902 ac tiene oficinas el movimiento octubre y el frente transversal
4263903 tratamos de ayudarlos y si no podemos a diferencia de los pol ticos tradicionales no les mentimos
4263904 como somos miles tenemos suficiente poder para que los pol ticos nos atiendan el tel fono
4263905 el evangelico es muy activo y quiere involucrarse en pol tica para cambiar las cosas
4263906 cada cosa que le hemos pedido a macri respondi desde colchones y alimentos hasta planes de vivienda y espacios p blicos para hacer nuestros actos
4263907 hab amos tomado un local de ate en plena dictadura y n stor que ya era abogado evit que fu semos presos se jug la vida por nosotros
4263908 n stor es muy solidario l stima que las corporaciones no lo dejan hacer todo lo que l quiere ojal buenos aires fuese como santa cruz
4263909 en el 85 mi mujer militaba con cristina recorr an los barrios casa por casa hablando con la gente y en un momento cristina le dijo a mi mujer yo no salgo sin antes maquillarme como una puerta cristina siempre fue coqueta no es algo de ahora
4263910 vamos a juntar m s de 10 mil personas para demostrarle al gobierno que tenemos con qu bancarlo
4263911 estamos dispuestos a apoyar a la presidenta en la calle pero no significa que apoyemos la violencia
4263912 tenemos el apoyo de m s de 1 800 pastores evang licos con que cada uno de ellos lleve 100 fieles el n mero es interesante no
4263913 nos asusta la enorme respuesta de los fieles hay muchos evangelicos que est n interesados en participar en pol tica
4263914 yo fui junto a edgardo depetri uno de los fundadores del frente transversal
4263915 el acto del 11 de octubre va a ser muy masivo no somos palau pero le vamos a demostrar a la presidenta que somos muchos y que queremos apoyarla
4263916 you got your eyes looking for something good god i dont need a reason
4263917 ces deux quipes sont excellentes je ne crois pas que le r sultat ait beaucoup dimportance mais nous devons en tirer des le ons pour progresser
4263918 nous savions depuis le d but que ce match serait synonyme daccession aux quarts de finale
4263919 why wasnt i informed of this new testing technique at my nearby toilet
4263920 testing on the toilet its not just for pregnancy anymore
4263921 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4263922 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4263923 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4263924 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4263925 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4263926 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4263927 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4263928 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4263929 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4263930 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4263931 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4263932 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4263933 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4263934 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4263935 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4263936 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4263937 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4263938 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4263939 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4263940 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4263941 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4263942 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4263943 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4263944 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4263945 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4263946 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4263947 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4263948 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4263949 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4263950 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4263951 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4263952 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4263953 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4263954 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4263955 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4263956 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4263957 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4263958 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4263959 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4263960 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4263961 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4263962 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4263963 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4263964 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4263965 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4263966 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4263967 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4263968 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

4263973 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4263974 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4263975 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

4263981 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4263982 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4263983 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4263984 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4263985 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4263986 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4263987 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4263988 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4263989 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4263990 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4263991 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4263992 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4263993 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4263994 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4263995 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4263996 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4263997 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4263998 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology

4264000 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4264001 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4264002 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4264003 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4264004 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4264005 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4264006 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4264007 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4264008 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4264009 just so you all know we did set a record
4264010 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4264011 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4264012 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

4264014 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4264015 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4264016 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4264017 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4264018 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4264019 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4264020 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4264021 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4264022 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4264023 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4264024 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4264025 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4264026 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4264027 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4264028 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4264029 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4264030 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4264031 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4264032 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4264033 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4264034 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4264035 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4264036 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4264037 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4264038 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4264039 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4264040 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4264041 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4264042 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4264043 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast

4264049 i am so glad i have w blue sky lives
4264050 what am i trying to see if there aint nothing in sight why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight
4264051 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4264052 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4264053 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4264054 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4264055 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4264056 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4264057 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4264058 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4264059 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4264060 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4264061 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4264062 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4264063 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4264064 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4264065 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4264066 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4264067 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4264068 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4264069 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4264070 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4264071 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4264072 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4264073 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4264074 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4264075 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4264076 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4264077 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4264078 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4264079 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4264080 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4264081 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4264082 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4264083 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4264084 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4264085 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4264086 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4264087 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4264088 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4264089 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4264090 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4264091 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4264092 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4264093 these are all small things and they all add up
4264094 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4264095 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4264096 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4264097 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4264098 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4264099 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4264100 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4264101 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4264102 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4264103 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4264104 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4264105 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4264106 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4264107 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4264108 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4264109 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4264110 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4264111 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4264112 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4264113 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4264114 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4264115 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4264116 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4264117 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4264118 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4264119 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4264120 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4264121 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4264122 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4264123 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4264124 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4264125 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4264126 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4264127 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4264128 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4264129 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4264130 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4264131 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4264132 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4264133 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4264134 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4264135 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4264136 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4264137 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4264138 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4264139 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4264140 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4264141 liriano was a freak before he got hurt he was throwing 98 and there was not a comfortable at bat against him now hes still finding it im sure hell get a little better will he ever get back to where he was he was throwing 92 mph sliders before he got hurt
4264142 i think the long inning might have gotten to him when he had to go back out there
4264143 he had a good breaking ball his fastball was in and out i think he had a better change up and breaking ball than fastball
4264144 actually mlb umps may suck but in this particular situation they are only following orders sounds like nuremburg
4264145 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4264146 ill go to good will for celebrity news from video and pictures http www wallpapersdump com celebrity
4264147 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4264148 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4264149 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4264150 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4264151 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4264152 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4264153 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4264154 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4264155 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4264156 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4264157 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4264158 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4264159 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4264160 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4264161 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4264162 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4264163 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4264164 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4264165 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4264166 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4264167 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4264168 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4264169 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4264170 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4264171 as far as i know youre still allowed to throw a party in your house
4264172 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4264173 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4264174 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4264175 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4264176 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4264177 youre not a wine snob youre taking too long thinking about the question
4264178 do you mind if i ask you a few questions
4264179 what did your father like about the sales the store was generating when the store was owned by the previous owners
4264180 ill bet wine sales have been going down every month since the old owners left would that be correct
4264181 i am thinking that the previous owners had their wine on the shelf according to the type of grape chardonnay here cabernet here reisling here rose here and so forth right
4264182 and do your fathers friends come in here and buy a lot of beer
4264183 a report by the center for american progress and the center for democracy and technology has found there is too little action being taken against online criminals despite rising consumer concern about online safety the report found that u s state officials were spending only 40 per cent of case time investigating online fraudsters preferring instead to concentrate on higher profile solicitation and pornography cases only 8 9 per cent of investigations involved data security confidential records or identity theft and 15 5 per cent involved online sales and services such as failure to deliver on a purchase

4264186 the state of software development today we should all worry
4264187 well ive been down here for 6 days and have been playing catch every other day right now ill be moving back to 75 feet for a couple days and then 90 feet for another week after that i will be throwing everyday from 60 feet i think its just going to be progression from there and see where im at im not sure about a mound visit yet might happen later in the month im sure and i guess it really depends if we are still in the race and im sure its been going great so far kind of what i expected no problems at all but i havent really been tossing hard at all my only concern is when i start letting it go and when i throw my slider and also when the adrenaline starts flowing i think thats something you cant really prepare for its either going to be fine or hurt so well see when i start throwing it a little harder the docs seem pretty upbeat that i can come back from this im still not sure im taking it slow and will test it when they tell me to i still have no clue with a time frame could get surgery or i could be back in the middle of september if things are fine im going to prepare to be ready to go if needed if i have setbacks i will slow things down and reevaluate check back in a week and im sure i will know more
4264188 same thing goes for radke in 2006 he tore his labrum late in the 2005 season had he opted for surgery immediately hed have been ready by mid 2006 season at the very latest instead he pitched hurt the entire season and had nothing left by the playoffs when they needed him most
4264189 one other thing on bradford 15 1 post season innings pitched 0 earned runs
4264190 and someone has been complaining about me not mentioning ricky barrett as a relief option well hes left handed which is not what the twins are looking for and theres other reasons i cant print why hes not an option right now
4264191 youre conspiracy theorists you dont think the fo wants to succeed you think theyre deliberately undermining the team
4264192 to step up stand up and stick up for our soldiers
4264193 i have a message for you medea get out of our country
4264194 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4264195 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4264196 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4264197 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4264198 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4264199 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4264200 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4264201 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4264202 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4264203 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4264204 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4264205 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4264206 these new silicon products will spur additional growth in bluetooth enabled product shipments and high speed bluetooth asps average selling prices will help to keep revenues strong as other bluetooth asps continue to decline current market growth for bluetooth devices is primarily attributed to sales growth in mobile phones which is the top market for bluetooth silicon shipments
4264207 it doesnt seem like we make these kinds of mistakes at home
4264208 this is a tough one to take we had chances to score runs throwing to the wrong base just stupid stuff
4264209 nick punto has played much better than he did last season but hes slumping now and probably needs a day off but who else plays second
4264210 people are so eager to blame punto for everything they cant even interpret what actually happened on the field
4264211 in fact i believe the royals did in fact intentionally walk span to get to punto
4264212 just because kubel had a bad game doesnt mean punto should be given a free pass
4264213 just because kubel had a bad game doesnt mean puntos poor play should be defended or minimized
4264214 kjr you were out of line on the la velle smoking another one remark
4264215 mike lamb failed to cover first base on a comebacker to the mound leading to a wild flip throw by scott baker to a scrambling nick punto all denard span had to do in the 12th was to set his feet and he has a chance to throw mark teahen out
4264216 august 11th 2008 at 12 25 pm of course in my case i have to trust my girlfriend s a little i am off to do another nooner jimmy bee you are in charge until i return
4264217 if you want your arguments to be taken seriously you should probably avoid the
4264218 just you and many like you who have this need for scapegoats and oversimplifications
4264219 but again youd rather deal in absolutes if anybody disagress that punto isnt the only problem than obviously they are apologists
4264220 can anyone give me a hint as to how lapanta leaves the stadium after a game is complete while they are deflating the dome inquiring minds want to know
4264221 if youre going to call me out for a lack of reading comprehension you probably shouldnt make statements such as that
4264222 as obviously you dont actually read anything i have to say anyway
4264223 and the twins need a lot of innings out of slowey tonight my emphasis like i said
4264224 its really comical to watch ron coomer explain why alex rodriguez is such a good hitter good lord
4264225 span and dy got the pressure on gomez and cuddyer looks like those two might be battling for the last outfield spot
4264226 i thought the umps were responsible for any mistakes that lead to yankee runs not the perfect twin pitchers
4264227 and romer dont think cuddys gonna be fighting for much of anything until next season
4264228 yankees playing like that they do not deserve to be in a pennant race
4264229 is it just me or has mauer seemed rather lazy behind the plate the last couple of weeks
4264230 if you watch it on tv youd think every ball in play was a dinger
4264231 jason does have one thing correct gardy does not trust kubel against a lefty wow to be pinch hit for by gomez who then promptly strikes out
4264232 the biggest piece of evidence of gardys distrust of kubel versus lefties was pinch hitting randy ruiz for him in the seventh last night when ruiz had a grand total of 9 major league at bats
4264233 also if you notice his batting average has been falling each year and his home run power has not increased
4264234 som ton ring har man mycket att t nka p och kan l tt tappa bort sig sj lv
4264235 twins royals a sweep and a 4 2 road trip on the line
4264236 why has brendan harris been benching it lately he was swinging a hot bat
4264237 i guess im surprised that i hadnt heard about this particular issue
4264238 harris has been killing the ball lately in my mind you find a way to work him into the lineup
4264239 it seemed from that like he took a bad angle it seemed like he took a very non linear route to get where he got
4264240 id like to see delany and slama moved up to aaa to see if they have a shot of helping in september
4264241 did you see the play everett made to end the 8th inning last night harris could only dream of reaching that ball
4264242 dave did you see harris last couple of doubles everett could only dream of htiting one of those
4264243 hit to the hole gap and he cant come up with it base hit
4264244 has nolte been used to close games or more as a setup guy
4264245 oh the royals zack greinke has dropped the appeal of his suspension for last weeks dust up with the white sox and began serving his five game ban today
4264246 3 1 score i referenced included accounting for everetts rbi
4264247 chief once again demonstrating his amazing ability to see into the future
4264248 hry since when does the 2b cover 1b on a grounder to the pitcher
4264249 imgaine that punto with another out there is absolutely no reason why he should be in the starting lineup tomorrow night against the yankees
4264250 on a 1 2 count just get the guy at the plate
4264251 craig your last two statements are why nobody ever takes you seriously
4264252 harris fails to put the ball in play what have you been watching the team
4264253 did you really think the twins would be in this position
4264254 just be happy its august and were not in last

4264259 oh i thought you called me something nasty like a weiner waiter or something
4264260 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself

4264262 sadly most of them can do nothing to provide their children with another type of education and just have to conform themselves to send them to these schools
4264263 this is very serious this is one of the worst things that could be happening to our school system
4264264 repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4264265 the future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance on nov 4
4264266 will they inherit an america based on our judeo christian heritage or will they inherit a secular godless society where individual responsibility and freedom have disappeared
4264267 we are on an even more slippery slope and we simply cannot afford to shirk our responsibility as citizens
4264268 there are many pressing issues that will motivate voters this november gas prices the war in iraq and the health of our economy and society
4264269 though those issues are important and deserve serious consideration the issues values voters will be considering supersede issues of the pocketbook
4264270 in fact its a moot point because senator obama has declared that once enacted by congress he will sign the freedom of choice act which will repeal every state local and federal pro life law on the books
4264271 i dont see the democratic platform writers talking about that
4264272 as gambling invades new areas it acts much like a black hole that drains money out of local economies takes customers and revenue away from local businesses and causes a net economic drain on surrounding communities
4264273 port canaveral likely will have a sinking boat in its harbor
4264274 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
4264275 and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4264276 im confident that at the end of the day the running mate will be pro life
4264277 we appreciate the school districts decision to do the right thing
4264278 we look forward to a change in district policy that will make that good decision permanent so the free speech rights of community members and groups will continue to be protected
4264279 written notice to the governing body of the school the district superintendent if any the schools principal and the collective bargaining agent for the schools faculty if any informing them that the school is so designated
4264280 i was glad to see you write about administrators in lawrence doing their doctoral program work during school hours we have one here at the south lawrence east school principal dina hickey
4264281 we are very happy to be here in the united states and in phoenix the mountains remind my parents of bhutan

4264287 its not the first research to show a correlation between talent management and financial results
4264288 but its one in a handful and i think it really adds to that body of evidence that is helping organizations to build a solid business case for investments in talent management
4264289 smaller competitors who havent done this work really scramble in a lot of cases when it comes to filling holes in their workforce
4264290 youre too small to do it by yourself but perhaps havent built the infrastructure or managerial focus
4264291 obviously yannick has proven he is a very good player and weve had a lot of desire to have him
4264292 hes the kind of player that can be a big impact for a team and were glad we were able to reach an agreement to bring him to our club unfortunately we had to give up not only quality players but quality individuals in return its the tough part of the business when you have to part with players who have meant as much to your club as those three have but we now look ahead and are excited to see what yannick will bring to our organization
4264293 i had the pleasure of coaching yannick at the all star game in stockton this past year and i was very impressed by his determination and drive to win a championship
4264294 personally im very excited to coach him and i think hell add a terrific offensive dynamic to our club at the same time the sad part is saying goodbye to quality players like mike jarret and steve and i wish them the very best
4264295 great all it takes to make witz happy is having some foreign chick on ecstasy make him a sandwhich

4264311 terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4264312 we have credible reports of villages being burned of shootings of killings of innocent people and civilians
4264313 we heard sirens and shooting and hurried to leave the area
4264314 outside gori there were people on the road looking for cars to take them away
4264315 a proportionate response to an unprovoked assault on it citizens
4264316 no intention of annexing or occupying any part of georgia
4264317 over the next few days on the condition that georgia refrains from military activity and keeps its forces out of the region russia will continue to take the diplomatic steps required to consolidate this temporary cessation to hostilities
4264318 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4264319 kathleen has been deeply involved with the automobile industry from market preferences to the most efficient manufacturing techniques and has a clear vision to optimize the development of the faw cars that we commercialize
4264320 today we take a fundamental step in the strengthening of our team which will allow us to further extend the operations scale for the benefit of millions of customers who need efficient transportation in the communities where we operate
4264321 im proud to be part of grupo salinas motors and to report directly to mr salinas building the automobile company of the 21st century
4264322 we will combine the enormous strengths of banco azteca and the elektra stores to take our superior quality vehicles to new market segments in mexico improving their living standards
4264323 i want to extend my recognition to javier sarro cortina who has been responsible for the negotiations with faw and the successful launch of the automobile business
4264324 javier will bring his vast previous experience as chief executive officer of grupo elektra and his proven effectiveness in the interaction between faw and domestic authorities to support grupo salinas and kathleen ligockis management to stimulate in a joint way this new growth phase of our automobile division

4264331 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft
4264332 when the muscles came into it bernard had a few more muscles than eamon did
4264333 its a little bit of tactics a little bit of foresight a little bit of hope
4264334 i was so nervous i think my feet were shaking on the blocks
4264335 i just wanted to give kylie and macca the best lead possible
4264336 ive got to tell you our thoughts were to have kylie in the third leg because we knew what a scrapper she was
4264337 shed pick up some ground for us if we were behind we didnt expect to be where we were
4264338 i was given a really big opportunity i knew i had it i just had to put it together in a race
4264339 i had no idea what was going on in the race
4264340 i was just concentrating on what i had to do
4264341 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4264342 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4264343 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4264344 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4264345 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4264346 how could you nonviolently kill somebody i would love to be able to do that
4264347 i have a very hard time with this word non violence because i dont believe that i am non violent
4264348 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4264349 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4264350 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us

4264365 i have no preference one way or another you have to go with what is happening
4264366 it is nothing to panic about we work without rest to look for players and we have always known the deadline day is august 31 we are working calmly in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can
4264367 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4264368 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4264369 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4264370 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4264371 the investigation into the double murders of benjamin and catherine mullany has been on going this morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at st johns magistrates court having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders

4264377 its nice to see a democrat blow something besides the election
4264378 we feel that these people in hollywood have made a fortune having a good time
4264379 people like to see them take a fall and get their comeuppance
4264380 neither mccain nor obama want to be seen as celebrities yet both of them are so what we have here is both hypocrisy and absurdity
4264381 mccain needs to paint obama as a harvard elite egghead celebrity
4264382 now he feels like hes ringing the pinball machine the last thing obama needs is to be seen in a photograph with a celebrity

4264400 i learned a lot from letterman and leno while living in the states
4264401 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
4264402 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
4264403 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
4264404 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable
4264405 it means the post 1989 policy to imbue youth with nationalism through patriotic education has succeeded
4264406 they felt the most important thing was to help chinese education they wanted to teach
4264407 people say dai qings stupid after 20 years of going overseas she doesnt even have a green card
4264408 to be honest when we go abroad we do find people asking strange questions like whether china has modern buildings or cars
4264409 sometimes its hard not to feel they have some bias
4264410 theyre being anti western to feel attached to their own country
4264411 as soon as they get online they can be totally immersed in a chinese environment
4264412 when we were studying abroad occasionally you went to chinatown to read a chinese paper now if youre in the u k you can easily not read english papers or watch english tv
4264413 young chinese feel they have the right to speak out about anything
4264414 this generation doesnt want to accept any ideological message whether its from the communist party or voice of america
4264415 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4264416 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4264417 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4264418 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4264419 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4264420 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4264421 hey dhani here are some new things to listen to the second one is really bare and i couldnt get my voice not to peak in the chorus without the rest sounding like a puddle its too fast too oh and for the april 12th one i was thinking you could sing it only if you want to i really want you to play your guitar on it though sorry about the wierd glitchy noises love yordan
4264422 haha that is some tight shit i cant believe you made that thats weed machine for sure come record that
4264423 i am who i am because of everyone what a bloody wrong concept of identity it shows that the person who made up the slogan cant place boundaries on his own identity a sign of psychosis a person is who they are because of their personality traits memories ideas the sense of self consciousness etc not because of external factors or others identities it doesnt take a philosophy professor to understand what identity is
4264424 all of those interactions have in some way or other influenced the ideas and perspectives that are reflected in this book
4264425 the spillage will cause flooding along the banks of the white volta and move downstream to affect communities in the northern region of ghana
4264426 moral decadence such as indiscriminate sexual activities armed robbery embezzlement of funds and rape among other social vices should engage the attention of the church
4264427 now that we are in august we expect that from august 1st to 31st all returns for july should have been submitted
4264428 the ministers requested that the sustainable development charter for minerals and mining sector in africa should be circulated again to all member countries
4264429 member countries also discussed and agreed to participate in the work of the african union au task force on african mining vision 2050 the result which would form the basis for further development of the amp mining policy framework into the african mining policy
4264430 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
4264431 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
4264432 receives no compensation of any type from orion strategies and has not since may 15 2008
4264433 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
4264434 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
4264435 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4264436 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
4264437 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
4264438 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
4264439 one of them yelled what are you doing on this land god gave us this land and no arab dog will set foot on it
4264440 when the argument began to heat up one of the settlers pulled out a gun and the other beat me up i was able to fight back a little but then the other settler began to beat me up as well
4264441 we must speed up the process of harmonizing african mining policy framework as it would allow africa to arrive at its comparative advantage which would eventually lead to competitive advantage with or beneficiation intervention
4264442 it is evident that the value addition of our respective commodities presents opportunities for demand and markets particularly for artisinal and small scale mining on the continent
4264443 other projects of amp that seem non core such as the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach should not be left unattended as already prescribed by the european commissions legislation
4264444 since the formal launch of amp in 2004 we have never had any opportune time than now to get affiliated to the african union au
4264445 we need combination strategies for african countries to synergize their energies for the creation of energy pools for the development of the mineral industry

4264460 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4264461 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4264462 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4264463 this study provides the first indication that mindfulness meditation stress management training can have a direct impact on slowing hiv disease progression
4264464 the mindfulness program is a group based and low cost treatment and if this initial finding is replicated in larger samples its possible that such training can be used as a powerful complementary treatment for hiv disease alongside medications
4264465 you want unity which is why the obama people have been generous to the clintons

4264476 we would play ten hours straight just sitting on the porch
4264477 so many people would gather in the street that the cops would come along and say can you just go into one of the bars and become a band because we cant keep blocking off the street like this
4264478 managers sometimes take performance in past set ups and try to estimate what will happen in a new setting by interpolation
4264479 you cant steer these things like you can a bus
4264480 you have to learn to use the systems own self organising tendencies to your advantage

4264482 en esta temporada vemos a muchos j venes que buscan hongos en el bosque de la primavera o en los bald os pero algunos al consumirlos lo nico que consiguen son cuadros diarreicos en el menor de los casos o hasta lesiones serias en h gado y ri ones
4264483 tuvimos un joven que cort 24 hongos y los bati todos en una licuadora lo que provoc una fuerte diarrea y v mitos que lo llevaron al hospital
4264484 tambi n hemos tenido casos de intoxicaci n por personas que lo consumen para completar la dieta la sugerencia es no recoger hongos con fines alimenticios si no son expertos
4264485 han perdido el uso ritual medicinal y sacralizado que los antiguos hac an llamados por los sabios mexicanos teonan catl la carne de los dioses
4264486 en la actualidad los j venes s lo lo usan de manera hedonista para diversi n en busca s lo del placer por el placer pero esta pr ctica les puede propiciar alteraciones en la conciencia y cuando tienen fragilidad quiebres psic ticos y alucinatorios

4264491 a new franchise that we can use for years to come
4264492 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4264493 the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4264494 the paper highlights a real dilemma we have today in diabetes treatment
4264495 we have drugs that lower glucose but we seem to run into problems over time with improving outcomes particularly cardiovascular outcomes
4264496 is whether it is due to the disease or the drugs increasing cardiovascular risk
4264497 measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of waist to hip ratio or waist circumference should be used
4264498 the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
4264499 if the waist to hip ratio values were greater than 0 97 for men and 0 84 for women then individuals faced almost eight times increased risk for stroke compared to individuals with a waist to hip ratio less than 0 92 in men or less than 0 78 in women
4264500 is an appropriate measure to assess the risk of stroke and tia comparable to waist circumference
4264501 some of the barriers are so large that i dont think anyone can make a clear estimate on a timeline to surmount them but hopefully with market participation policy incentives and a lot of private money backing these groups the solutions will come to market sooner rather than later
4264502 three to five years is what ive been hearing since 2004
4264503 when you vote with the pocketbook all of a sudden you have this empowered american consumer which is probably the largest force for change on the face of the earth right now
4264504 we are going to have to come to terms with that and think about what our options are
4264505 i am not a social scientist but i think any of us can speculate on the kind of crises that can multiply out of resource shortages in terms of famine social unrest and war those are the choices that are going to become more and more stark over the coming decades if we dont do smarter things about our energy infrastructure
4264506 for a little company like ours this is a scary time
4264507 and i really fear that we are going to lose this opportunity
4264508 we are talking about thousands of systems that could go into washington state in the next three to five years and i think i am being conservative on that
4264509 and i think it is recognized especially in the clean tech space as having a delta between the level of rhetoric and the level of action which is disappointing
4264510 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
4264511 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
4264512 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
4264513 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
4264514 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
4264515 i had watched programmes on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
4264516 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
4264517 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
4264518 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
4264519 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
4264520 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
4264521 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
4264522 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
4264523 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
4264524 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
4264525 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
4264526 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
4264527 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
4264528 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
4264529 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
4264530 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
4264531 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
4264532 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
4264533 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
4264534 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
4264535 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
4264536 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
4264537 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
4264538 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
4264539 it takes a long long time to come to terms with it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is
4264540 she is still young and everything is raw for her she hates the label transsexual she is just a girl who happened to need the surgery to make her genitals right
4264541 theres only one other guy that knows what hes going through and thats me
4264542 and my comment to that is you expect me to look like my poster photo that was done in 1972
4264543 pro bono means for the public good what rosenthal shouldve said is that huffington wants writers to work for free so she can sell ads around their work that aint the public good that aint good period
4264544 the huffington post has been a winning formula because it gives platforms to huffingtons d c and l a buddies who need vanity exposure more than they need money but when she comes into communities and applies the same formula theres another word for that formula and its exploitation
4264545 its hard for me to take any progressive site seriously that expects people to work for free while the founders make money at least wal mart pays minimum wage
4264546 like everyone else and their dog in chicago ive been asked to contribute to the new chicago version of huffington post for free
4264547 how about this if arianna writes for me for free ill write for her
4264548 we believe our proposed co operation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4264549 what theyre proposing is to create the worlds biggest airline with american airlines
4264550 but we know what dominant players do they snuff out competition they raise prices and they become even more dominant
4264551 i think ba would argue that it will reduce its cost structure which it can then pass on to a degree to passengers
4264552 ba is far less dominant than any of air france klm or lufthansa are out of their hubs
4264553 with tougher trading conditions for most airlines coupled with the need to support the spirit of the open skies agreement congress has no real excuse to delay the deal unnecessarily
4264554 this may not be good news for richard branson but it is good news for consumers
4264555 while some of them live paycheque to paycheque our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4264556 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4264557 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4264558 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4264559 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4264560 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4264561 in prior disclosures constellations management incorrectly omitted certain contracts with downgrade provisions to calculate collateral obligations in the event of a ratings downgrade
4264562 sufficient to drive an increase in collateral requirements that stresses the balance sheet nor do we see an immediate need for outside equity
4264563 we fail to see what can lift the significant negative overhang of the complex and volatile trading issues
4264564 while this highly strategic relationship with sobeys has the potential to be as significant as our other large retail partnerships it is not expected to have a material financial impact during the ramp up period
4264565 im much more concerned with whats going to happen over the 12 or 18 months as far as how their business is going to be impacted by the slowdown in consumer spending and air travel and no matter what you do with sobeys youre not going to get an immediate kick
4264566 there are a number of large institutions that have the shares and are really upset at this massive dilution
4264567 because the banks are very reluctant to give them more money
4264568 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially
4264569 that should bring the year over year number down a bit
4264570 the markets focus has shifted to the economy and how much it is contracting and not how much things cost a month ago
4264571 was lower than the previous weeks revision it still indicates that employment opportunities are getting fewer and fewer
4264572 the impression given to the voters is that this is a guarantee that the eliminated local taxes will be permanently replaced by new state revenue
4264573 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property taxes
4264574 the dollar has been taking its cues from crude oil prices and that has continued today with renewed decline in commodities
4264575 we are moving the server come back 2 hours from now
4264576 do not post a link or cast a vote for two hours because the server is being moved
4264577 move is finished now you may continue using balatarin also happy students day
4264578 in front of us was a large group of pilgrims and suddenly we felt strong hot waves of fire with the bang of the explosion and peoples bodies were ripped apart
4264579 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4264580 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4264581 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4264582 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4264583 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4264584 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4264585 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4264586 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4264587 utah has the best non bcs talent in the country
4264588 eventually we came up with enough flavors so we were like maybe we should just do this so were more than just competing
4264589 it has a flavor you cant even put your flavor on
4264590 it doesnt taste bitter like beer it tastes like ice cream but definitely guinness flavored ice cream
4264591 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4264592 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
4264593 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
4264594 its not surprising that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment
4264595 lately there has been a little typical sort of political flare up because i said something that everybody knows is true which is that there are a whole bunch of folks in small towns in pennsylvania in towns right here in indiana in my home town in illinois who are bitter
4264596 they are angry they feel like they have been left behind they feel like nobody is paying attention to what theyre going through
4264597 so i said well you know when youre bitter you turn to what you can count on
4264598 so people they vote about guns or they take comfort from their faith and their family and their community and they get mad about illegal immigrants who are coming over to this country or they get frustrated about you know how things are changing thats a natural response

4264600 the headline prime time speaker on wednesday will be barack obamas vice presidential nominee

4264604 once again bigoted fringe author jerome corsi is trying to make money off an election spinning garbage as journalism and relying on the right wing echo chamber to pump up sales
4264605 dig into the authors past statements increase surrogate action against the book and step up pressure on high level media executives for equal time to rebut charges
4264606 at no time intended or desired to trade off any reputation or goodwill established by green shift inc
4264607 we would still like to resolve the matter but that kind of thing really isnt conducive to a public discussion
4264608 the ipcc has not explained in a scientifically sound and coherent way how the greenhouse effect is maintained
4264609 put the middle class ahead of corporate interests to grow the economy
4264610 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4264611 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4264612 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4264613 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4264614 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4264615 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the defense contract audit agency dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments
4264616 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
4264617 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
4264618 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
4264619 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
4264620 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
4264621 it is clear that he did record some of our conversations but at no time did he inform me that he was doing so or seek my permission
4264622 i plan to consult counsel about the legality of his action
4264623 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service tahir jalil habbush al tikriti to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
4264624 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
4264625 they secretly resettled habbush in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
4264626 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
4264627 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
4264628 far from being comfortable i told mr suskind that many of the things he wrote about what i did and said were wrong
4264629 statement and my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
4264630 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
4264631 they were in fact on white paper i was asked to respond to documents regarding the potential use of habbush upon his defection and during the difficult fall of 2003 when we were wrestling with a developing iraqi insurgency and ways to combat it i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found many of such queries did originate from the staff of the office of the vice president none of this however substantiates mr suskinds explosive allegation
4264632 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr
4264633 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
4264634 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
4264635 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
4264636 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
4264637 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
4264638 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community
4264639 mr suskind appears to have conflated two separate conversations one about the problems of reading saddam husseins intentions an issue which is dealt with in the butler report and one about habbush
4264640 i made it clear to mr suskind that i was in no position to comment on the substance or significance of any dealing with the latter since i had not been privy to the detail of what had taken place something mr suskind has chosen not to mention and in any event i had made it clear to mr suskind when first he approached me that i would not divulge classified information to which i had had access during my time in government
4264641 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go
4264642 from the very first instance it was about iraq it was about what we can do to change this regime
4264643 buna ziua ma numesc urban iulian si am inteles ca o sunati pe mama mea de patru saptamani si vreau sa stiu cine sunteti
4264644 pai este normal sa stiu cum va cheama pentru ca mama mea este stresata de dvs si s a imbolnavit de nervi din cauza acestor telefoane
4264645 ma numesc marin vasile si sunt inspector la disciplina in constructii
4264646 in primul rand sa nu ma luati la per tu si apoi sa imi spuneti de ce nu vreti sa trimiteti o adresa oficiala mamei mele
4264647 ce legatura are firma urban sa cu apartamentul mamei mele nu este normal sa verificati intai cui apartine un apartament care este reclamat de cineva
4264648 eu nu verific domne nimic daca cineva reclama eu trebuie sa verific nu stau eu sa vad al cui este aparatamentul
4264649 cum asa pai asta inseamna ca pe baza reclamatiilor facute de tot felul de vecini dusmani sau dementi dvs inspectorii de la primaria sector 6 veniti in control chiar daca apartamentul controlat nu stiti nici macar cui apartine de ce nu verificati la registrul comertului la cartea funciara sau la dvs la impozite si taxe locale intai sa vedeti ca acasa la mama mea este o locuinta privata si nu spatii de birouri nu asa este normal
4264650 domne ai un tupeu fantastic eu nu verific nimic eu trebuie sa intru in casa sa verific reclamatia
4264651 locuinta este proprietatea privata a mamei mele si puteti sa intrebati administratorul de bloc sau vecinii ca acolo nu este nici o firma daca mama nu va da voie sa intrati atunci nu puteti intra intr o proprietate privata pur si simplu nu aveti acest drept si pana nu trimiteti o adresa oficiala sa explicati ca aveti o reclamatie cine a facut o si faptul ca vreti ca mama sa va dea acordul sa intrati in apartament daca mai sunati va dau in judecata pentru hartuire si abuz in serviciu mama nu are de ascuns nimic nu a facut modificari insa nu ai voie sa ameninti oamenii si sa incerci sa intri i apartamente profitand de faptul ca se vor speria de modul de abordare chiar si ultimii infractori din tara asta au drepturi

4264656 pentru ca sunteti romani trebuie sa platiti 4000 euro garantie
4264657 the referendum in its current form would undermine the vital humanitarian work of many psychologists
4264658 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
4264659 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
4264660 even if sampson was confused or mistaken in his interpretation of the rules that applied to immigration judge hiring we do not believe that would excuse his actions
4264661 his actions which were carried out over a lengthy period of time and were not based on formal advice from anyone systematically violated federal law and department policy and constituted misconduct
4264662 well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps than those i have described
4264663 for example some commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct
4264664 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
4264665 i am distressed that attorney general mukasey has been so quick to determine that no criminal offense has been committed in connection with the illegal hiring practices at the department of justice
4264666 it is not enough for mr mukasey to assert that things are different under his watch the department of justice cannot reestablish its credibility so long as it persists in a strategy designed to avoid revealing all the facts that have so compromised the integrity of the department of justice and to prevent real accountability for misconduct by former doj officials
4264667 blanket conclusions appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
4264668 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
4264669 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
4264670 among other things the department now has new hiring processes for immigration judges members of the board of immigration appeals honors program candidates and summer law interns with codified roles for career attorneys in the decision making process
4264671 we have instituted mandatory training for all political appointees regarding merit system principles and prohibited personnel practices and we will shortly be expanding that training to include all department employees whether political appointees or not involved in career hiring and we have revised various orders to reiterate the departments commitment to merit systems principles and to remove political appointees in the attorney generals office from the process of hiring career attorneys
4264672 to the extent we can we intend to contact candidates for the attorney generals honors program who may have been improperly eliminated from consideration and encourage them to apply for any vacancies at the department
4264673 each of them will be assured a fair evaluation similarly we will contact those who may have been improperly denied temporary details to jobs at main justice to see if they are interested in any new opportunities that are or may become available
4264674 there is a principle of equity that we all learned in the schoolyard and that remains as true today as when we first heard it two wrongs do not make a right
4264675 that some of the officials involved in hiring gave improper consideration to politics does not mean that the people they hired are unqualified for their jobs it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
4264676 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
4264677 people voted for change and they voted for democrats who will take our country in a new direction
4264678 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
4264679 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
4264680 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
4264681 who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table nobody told them to do this
4264682 one million iraqis are dead five thousand americans are dead you have destroyed the first second fourth fifth and eighth amendments
4264683 i take an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the united states and dont tell me that i dont do that
4264684 why dont you go picket the republicans in congress that will not allow us to have a vote on the war this is not very effective not very effective
4264685 as speaker of the house the third highest office first is the president then vice president and then speaker i take my responsibilities deadly seriously
4264686 i try to promote bipartisanship but thats not what the other side wants
4264687 that one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the united states military and other government agencies in a war zone where employees of private contractors now outnumber american troops
4264688 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
4264689 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
4264690 overbilling fraud and shoddy and unsafe work that has endangered and even killed american troops
4264691 the budget offices report found that from 2003 to 2007 the government awarded contracts in iraq worth about 85 billion and that the administration was now awarding contracts at a rate of 15 billion to 20 billion a year at that pace contracting costs will surge past the 100 billion mark before the end of the year through 2007 spending on outside contractors accounted for 20 percent of the total costs of the war the budget office found according to the people with knowledge of the report
4264692 one whose roles and missions and even casualties among its work force have largely been hidden from public view
4264693 sanctions genocide planned genocide as part of its religious doctrine
4264694 millions of dollars in u s government grants to radical islamist organizations many of whose leaders have been convicted or indicted in terrorism cases in the united states
4264695 how saddam got weapons of mass destruction saddam husseins war machine is being built systematically to strike at the united states with new nuclear biological and chemical weapons designed to kill millions
4264696 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
4264697 convicted or indicted in terrorism cases in the united states
4264698 a muslim brotherhood affiliated organization which was an unindicted co conspirator in last years terrorist financing trial against the holy land foundation
4264699 publicly challenged the designation of hezbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations
4264700 a number of groups that the state department has funded or collaborated with have links to entities such as al qaida hamas and hezbollah all of which are designated as terrorist organizations by the united states government
4264701 legitimizes islamism to the world and sends mixed messages to our allies while sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding
4264702 all of their options which includes appealing the case to the supreme court
4264703 we are disappointed with todays ruling and are considering all of our appellate options
4264704 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
4264705 here not only did these officials cause untold harm to two individuals who honorably served their country they also jeopardized our national security for short term political gain courts must be available to remedy precisely this kind of harm to ensure such conduct is neither condoned nor repeated
4264706 the alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut mr wilsons comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory
4264707 but there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism such as that levied by mr wilson against the bush administrations handling of prewar foreign intelligence by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants duties as high level executive branch officials
4264708 this case is not just about what top government officials did to valerie and me
4264709 we brought this suit because we strongly believe that politicizing intelligence ultimately serves only to undermine the security of our nation todays decision is just the first step in what we have always known would be a long legal battle and we are committed to seeing this case through
4264710 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
4264711 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
4264712 when that guy was working for ken starr he wanted to go open the dresser drawers of the white house
4264713 i guess its a lot different when its a republican vice president
4264714 kentucky is the horse capital of the world beshear said
4264715 we must be a leader in ensuring the health and integrity of horses and of this vitally important industry a ban on anabolic steroids is an important part of that process
4264716 toughest no question about it everybody else says you can use stanozolol we hate that drug
4264717 we havent got the authority or right to tell someone who owns a horse what they can give that animal until that horse is placed in the entry box ward said
4264718 its just not possible trainers just cant live under the trauma all the time of an outside horse coming in and not knowing whether that animal has been treated or not
4264719 the withdraw time becomes irrelevant if a horse is positive leavitt said
4264720 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
4264721 the run up to the current chaos in the caucasus should look quite familiar russia acted unilaterally rather than going through the u
4264722 the problem with international law for a superpower is that it is a constraint on overweening ambition its virtue is that it constrains the aggressive ambitions of others bush gutted it because he thought the united states would not need it anytime soon but russia is now demonstrating that the bush doctrine can just as easily be the putin doctrine and that leaves america less secure in a world of vigilante powers that spout rhetoric about high ideals to justify their unchecked military interventions it is the world that bush has helped build
4264723 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4264724 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4264725 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4264726 so whats the point the point is to make a splash
4264727 my clients experience suggests they brought an indictment without careful evaluation of the evidence
4264728 they essentially took out the entire organization in one fell swoop
4264729 we had a hail storm that hurt us really bad two years ago
4264730 faced with desertions by his political supporters and the neutrality of the pakistani military president pervez musharraf of pakistan an important ally of the united states is expected to resign in the next few days rather

4264732 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine
4264733 he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet he walks around in 520 italian loafers
4264734 unless youve been living under a rock for the past few weeks
4264735 you probably know by now that tom cruise shows up in tropic thunder
4264736 one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
4264737 if anyone can fly a bucket of bolts through hyperspace he can
4264738 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4264739 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4264740 we know that a significant number of consumers are shopping in our merchandise categories each month
4264741 we also know that our customers spend an average of 30 to 40 each time they shop with us with jcp rewards we are able to reward customers for regularly shopping at jcpenney while building long term customer loyalty

4264744 and for what its worth i have difficulty with the notion of punishing minors for the actions of their parents
4264745 i simply do not understand the policy rationale for moving from a position of banning admissions altogether to one of opening them up in a largely unrestricted fashion for a brief period while the board decides on what would be the best policy
4264746 absolutely opposed to allowing illegal immigrants into the community college system
4264747 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone

4264752 the guardians are delighted that bishop lindsay has agreed to accept the post of priest administrator he is a wise and experienced pastor whose enthusiasm as a christian communicator is profound and infectious under his leadership we are confident that walsingham will continue to play a vital role in our church and nation
4264753 i am delighted about the appointment of bishop lindsay to the shrine at walsingham he has exceptional gifts as a pastor a teacher and a human being and all who come to the shrine not least the young will be very well cared for i send my prayers and good wishes for him in this next stage of his ministry
4264754 this seems a providential moment for bishop lindsay to be appointed as priest administrator for englands nazareth to have such a mission minded at its helm will be a source of great confidence to many
4264755 bishop lindsay is one of the most inspiring and creative missionary thinkers in the church of england committed both to the traditional church and to fresh expressions of the church his appointment is good news for walsingham and for the whole church
4264756 he looked me in the eye and patted me on my shoulder
4264757 as a journalist and a voter i would like to know why barack obama is so hesitant about defining himself
4264758 if barack obama continues to hide himself from american voters he encourages a negative information flow against him
4264759 this settlement isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4264760 rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society
4264761 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4264762 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4264763 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4264764 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4264765 oh geeez its the olympics where did they come from
4264766 hey did you guys know the olympics were this week better pull the episode
4264767 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4264768 i see him all the time at least once a week
4264769 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty

4264774 indent the first line of each paragraph one half inch
4264775 theyre already into this stuff the kids know how to do this stuff theyve been to facebook theyve been to myspace and even the social chat rooms schools need to come up with a way to incorporate that technology into our day to day lessons

4264777 it would be best for all 8700 plus class members claims to be resolved in one lawsuit thus it means that this case will either be resolved by trial or settlement with compensation for all 8700 plus class members
4264778 as for plaintiffs suggestion that greed led defendants to drop maui in lieu of chicago that is not an allegation of fact it is a conclusion
4264779 more important it is a conclusion that has no legal significance because it is economically irrational plaintiffs allege the moving defendants aerosmith originally had three concerts scheduled chicago maui and the toyota event in oahu and then purportedly out of greed eliminated maui and performed two concerts that makes no sense if plaintiffs allegations of motive are correct the only rational thing for the moving defendants to have done would be to play all three concerts not reduce their revenues by playing just two
4264780 i am the most annoying person to watch the olympics with im a condescending former elite athlete who loathes the armchair fan i love sports i love athletes i hate fans
4264781 im especially annoyed by those who believe their dalliances in amateur childhood athletics give them insight into the travails and accomplishments of olympic athletes
4264782 you loved nadia and begged your mom to sign you up for gymnastics classes you went two days a week until you were in junior high but then your body developed and boys noticed and hanging out at the mall or trying out for the cheerleading squad seemed a lot more appealing than spending the afternoon in a chalky musty gym scared out of your wits to do what the coach was demanding i was practicing 12 hours a week by the time i was 7 traveling up and down the new jersey turnpike each weekend for competitions i moved away from home when i was 14 trained 40 hours a week while attending high school endured untold abuses by overenthusiastic coaches who weighed me twice a day to make sure i didnt inadvertently get fat during my seven hour practice i broke my femur at the 1985 world championships when i fell from the uneven bars on my last event of the competition my parents ignored my depression and starvation assuming i was happy because i won medals i did gymnastics
4264783 i get the feeling that regular folks believe that if they just had the heart to stick with it through 10th grade they too would be celebrating on the medal stand in beijing along with michael phelps and dara torres do olympic fans understand how unimaginably hard it is to overcome fear persevere through injury come through in the clutch give up ones entire life in the name of a few possible yet unlikely moments of glory
4264784 and i will watch alone where i cant offend anybody by acting like a total jerk
4264785 cum stai cu pepecedistele intr o camera nu te inteleg
4264786 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4264787 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4264788 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4264789 we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen
4264790 in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4264791 your life as a career criminal comes to an end today
4264792 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
4264793 oh im sure theres lots of things that all of america doesnt know about me
4264794 is this a good time for you being away from her on the campaign trail
4264795 last week we were together the entire week on the campaign trail had our kids with us and i talk to her constantly so were both doing fine
4264796 he has this quiet demeanor easy going person like somebody that you could get along with
4264797 i remember his sincerity and compassion and his real interest
4264798 i would just tell him i will keep him in my prayers
4264799 i hope the democrats pick someone who has integrity is honest open good human being
4264800 this is a woman whos got a terminal disease and two young children and a grown child
4264801 what we learned was that what was paramount in her thinking was i need to stay with my husband because my kids need a father when im perhaps not there
4264802 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
4264803 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4264804 she found out her husband had been cheating on her her husband of 30 years
4264805 were told that his wife elizabeth does believe john edwards when he says he is not the father of this baby
4264806 i feel really bad for her because of the circumstances
4264807 i think its really unfortunate what shes going through and i have sympathy for her for that
4264808 its a relationship its private and we dont really know what goes on in a relationship
4264809 then i saw the gun in my face already and the next thing one of them said dont do it
4264810 i got so panicked when i saw the gun and i said ok take the money
4264811 it just makes you wonder who you can trust now
4264812 we know who the shooter is the shooter was sitting in the middle between the two other women
4264813 and we have some forensic evidence that will help us in this case
4264814 i was just trying to make a living and i could be dead in a second
4264815 i try to be so good to people i wouldnt expect that would happen to me
4264816 i just lost my wife my two kids need support
4264817 this is all part of a program called learn it grow it eat it
4264818 we work with youth in the bronx here high school students to teach them about the environmental connections to food
4264819 we take them out to local community gardens where they get their hands dirty
4264820 they learn about how vegetables grow they actually start growing them and then the great part is we get to hire them in the summer and they see the fruits of their labor

4264827 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4264828 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4264830 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4264832 the steady test score gains made by students across the state shown in the new star program results are a tribute to the dedication of teachers parents and students working together to achieve academic success
4264833 this steady and significant progress cannot continue if our schools and students dont have the resources they need with schools already starting across the state its time for the legislature to pass a responsible state budget one that protects our schools from deeper cuts and takes a balanced approach to the budget deficit our students didnt create the state budget crisis and their futures shouldnt be sacrificed to solve it

4264835 as we make our rounds of conservative washington we glimpse something much greater than single acts of incompetence or obstruction we see a vast machinery built for our protection reengineered into a device for our exploitation we behold the majestic workings of the free market itself boring ever deeper into the tissues of the state ultimately we gaze upon one of the true marvels of history democracy buried beneath an avalanche of money

4264867 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese

4264871 you soon to be graduates are a diverse lot you come from all over the world work in every news medium and cover the whole range of complicated subjects but every one of you is a reporter you know how to gather information primarily through in person interviewing and to present it accurately fairly and engagingly i would urge you however not to take it for granted that the best way to present information is an 800 word all text pyramid style news story a method of presentation that grew up in the nineteenth century and dominated our profession for most of the twentieth but may not in the twenty first
4264872 on your watch newspapers will be primarily digital but the primary task for you is not to switch delivery media its to invent a new social compact with a community around the gathering and presentation of information
4264873 through most of this meeting i just wanted to shout
4264874 people might be angry or frightened by what janet is saying but shes right and they need to start recognizing that she is doing this because she cares that woman is not only carrying the burdens of an entire newsroom on her shoulders but the burdens of a community entitled to quality news and i know shes taking the right steps
4264875 another problem i and my peers have encountered in internships is an eagerness to turn us away from journalism or jade us in some way

4264877 people who dont get it and wont have a job in the biz for long
4264878 for their potential to shape the media industry in the years ahead
4264879 we dont know if hes in the water or not
4264880 information center frankly is the newsroom of the future it will fulfill todays needs for a more flexible broader based approach to the information gathering process and it will be platform agnostic news and information will be delivered to the right media be it newspapers online mobile video or ones not yet invented at the right time our customers will decide which they prefer
4264881 as a general rule though raw data is pretty useless without a framework to interpret it back in the day reporters used databases to write stories now it seems they put up databases hoping the public will make their own stories with them
4264882 organizing and presenting information of this kind no small feat entails certain responsibilities doesnt it

4264897 if theyre not going to cut it then theres going to be more wrecks i think they need to get a stop sign or something up or at least a yield sign
4264898 a lot of times when cars are coming this way people dont stop and the grass is so tall you cant even see cars or people walking this way
4264899 either the city needs to do something with it or someone needs to take care of their property plain and simple
4264900 we could stand here on a busy day and nobody stops its just that one person thats going to cause another wreck or get somebody killed

4264932 it was disappointing to record a loss in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of income the loss was attributable to the downtime of the mill at montana tunnels as a direct result of the previously announced ball mill shell failure due to cracking which occurred on april 27 2008 coupled with lower lead and zinc prices the team at our montana tunnels mine is to be congratulated in completing a tremendous job of repair on the mill enabling us to get back into production within a three week period i am happy to report that since the repair the mill has been performing well at black fox we are continuing to make progress towards production in 2009 some other noteworthy recent developments more fully described below are a the purchase of the stock mill complex to process ore from our black fox project b the ordering of a new regrind ball mill for upgrading the recently purchased stock mill c the purchase of five haul trucks for use at black fox and d the recent successful equity raise i anticipate that gbm mec ltd our mill consultants will complete the study on upgrading the stock mill throughput from its current design of 1 100 tonnes per day up to 1 500 tonnes per day by the end of september 2008 also next week we expect to file the black fox project mine closure plan with the ministry of northern development and mines in ontario which we anticipate will enable us to commence alluvial till overburden removal in early october 2008

4265020 mobility as an issue is moving throughout enterprise its not just road warrior types
4265021 it not only increases security on individual machines but when a dell laptop goes online it calls home when theres an alert that the laptop was lost or stolen can wipe the laptop
4265022 you may not get the laptop back but you wont have to worry about your data
4265023 that was a great example of a mobile solution that leaned more to style than technical substance
4265024 its a beautiful product but the lack of ability to change batteries and the systems relatively short battery life to begin with makes it a pretty but essentially useless product

4265042 me siento muy contento y agradecido como siempre por el hecho de poder estar en un partido tan importante que es rumbo al mundial
4265043 estar en una lista que se ve a muy complicada viene gente de europa elementos que est n haciendo las cosas muy bien y que la mayor a son defensores entonces ocupar un lugar en esa l nea es dif cil
4265044 me hubiera gustado que estuvieran m s elementos de chivas porque tienen mucha calidad hay gente que podr a ocupar un lugar ah pero tambi n s que cada d a se cierra m s la competencia
4265045 estar en la selecci n se va complicando porque son gente que por eso est en el extranjero que tiene much sima calidad pero tambi n siempre he dicho que los hechos hablan por s solos y creo que eso me ha hecho que siga constante en el selectivo

4265054 we are going to be at markex cape because the show embodies exactly what we are all about effective communication we look forward to involving everyone in our methodology at markex cape
4265055 from the absolutely outstanding response to our range at market gauteng in june we are convinced that we have a product offering that companies are searching for
4265056 cape town in particular is home to many restaurants and dining establishments in the general hospitality industry and so were looking forward to serving these companies following our exposure at markex cape
4265057 it makes sense that the target visitors for markex cape would wait for the show to come to their doorstep rather than to travel to markex gauteng and we look forward to bringing our offering to them
4265058 and we do have products that the market needs judging by the large numbers of orders we have been receiving since the day after markex gauteng opened
4265059 currently the angolan economy as measured by per capita gdp is experiencing growth in excess of 20 per annum
4265060 as the leading privately owned shipping company in south africa we took the decision some years back to expand our operations firstly into english speaking countries in east africa and subsequently into mozambique and madagascar
4265061 on the back of our success in these countries we are now ready to do business in angola and in due course to explore other opportunities in the region
4265062 despite the relative proximity to sa and the presence of a few sa companies in angola however the overwhelming percentage of that countrys trade is conducted with countries from europe and elsewhere transport and communication lines with angola is a pre requisite to moving some of that business to south africa and sturrock shipping is pleased to be in the vanguard of this initiative
4265063 the aim of the survey was to set a baseline to measure service delivery for future budgetary prioritisation it is the first of its kind in south africa and confirms the citys commitment to service delivery

4265067 if youve ever sold a car thats been in an accident you know from experience that its simply not worth as much as the same car with an accident free history
4265068 unfortunately most consumers arent aware that they are entitled to diminished value compensation and insurance companies dont volunteer that information
4265069 its commonplace and common sense for used car buyers to check a vehicles accident and repair history using an online service like carfax or autocheck
4265070 each insurance company has its own internal procedures and there is a maze of regulations and legal loopholes that vary from state to state
4265071 the burden of proving diminished value is always on consumers and they simply dont have the experience to get the compensation they deserve
4265072 although car owners routinely file insurance claims for car repairs and injuries they almost always overlook the long term impact that an accident will have on their vehicles value
4265073 the process of establishing diminished value and then negotiating the proper compensation is both an art and a science
4265074 were committed to supporting each and every consumer whose vehicle suffers from diminished value after an accident

4265104 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
4265105 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep
4265106 and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
4265107 then god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness god called the light day and the darkness he called night
4265108 so the evening and the morning were the first day
4265109 and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and god called the firmament heaven
4265110 so the evening and the morning where the second day
4265111 then god said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
4265112 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so

4265175 you loved nadia and begged your mom to sign you up for gymnastics classes you went two days a week until you were in junior high but then your body developed and boys noticed and hanging out at the mall or trying out for the cheerleading squad seemed a lot more appealing than spending the afternoon in a chalky musty gym scared out of your wits to do what the coach was demanding i was practicing 12 hours a week by the time i was 7 traveling up and down the new jersey turnpike each weekend for competitions i moved away from home when i was 14 trained 40 hours a week while attending high school endured untold abuses by overenthusiastic coaches who weighed me twice a day to make sure i didnt inadvertently get fat during my seven hour practice i broke my femur at the 1985 world championships when i fell from the uneven bars on my last event of the competition my parents ignored my depression and starvation assuming i was happy because i won medals i did gymnastics
4265176 i get the feeling that regular folks believe that if they just had the heart to stick with it through 10th grade they too would be celebrating on the medal stand in beijing along with michael phelps and dara torres do olympic fans understand how unimaginably hard it is to overcome fear persevere through injury come through in the clutch give up ones entire life in the name of a few possible yet unlikely moments of glory

4265183 a lot of brno is built up basically of chicanes its chicane after chicane youve got to have pretty good agility and its pretty high speed in places i think they just repaved it there were some pretty good braking bumps around the track they should be smoothed out im looking forward to it last year bridgestone had a monstrous advantage with stoner and hopkins just taking off and leaving everybody with the new pavement maybe that throws a little wrench in it and maybe well get lucky after these last few weekends with those black round things we need to sort that out
4265184 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track ive now got full movement back in the injured knee and its been fine during my training regime up to now i dont think its going to cause me any problems on the bike but its been almost seven weeks since ive thrown a leg over the ninja zx rr so i wont know for sure until we start free practice on friday brno is a track i like a lot and i believe its the motogp track ive ridden most frequently in my career which means i know the place like the back of my hand also our bridgestone tires work well at this track and this combined with the new parts that kawasaki are bringing to the czech grand prix means weve got some positive things to work with
4265185 as hard a decision as it is and as bad as i feel about it i think im better off staying home doing rehab and physio then come back fit at misano and try to finish the season strong theres been a lot of guys this year trying to ride less than 100 percent and actually making their problems worse i certainly feel bad about it for my team and i apologize i had the permission of hrc to do the supermoto thing i just wanted to do some riding during the break have some fun and i thought that maybe itd give me a little spark for the rest of the season but it backfired on me

4265197 its either gonna be called a twisted christmas or the twisted christmas a musical it tells a story but its very much a concert event but theres a storyline going on between the show is about 20 songs the band are the only actors there is a narrator i will tell you that much who fills in the spaces hes on video screen and he tells ala the rocky horror picture show to be honest he helps move the story along and tell the story if you saw hedwig and the angry inch off broadway a band performs and then in between there is interaction which further moves the story along so its pretty involved its a unique combination of things that have been done before and havent been done before and the goal really cause were not playing ourselves were playing a fictitious band in the musical eventually is to like the blue man group have a whole bunch of casts out there during the holiday season performing the show so thats the ultimate goal so its in development but its well on its way like i said i finished the script everybody loves it and now im sinking my teeth into writing the album which well start recording in january february for release in 2009

4265221 obama is also opening up the campaign and giving average americans a chance to offer opinions and information on important policy issues and americans have responded over 15 000 policy ideas have been submitted through the web site

4265223 competition has been a great strength for america offering opportunity low prices and increased choice for our citizens markets work best when there is robust competition competition means that any new devices invented cost less because there are more choices this ensures more americans can afford to be part of the digital economy
4265224 an obama administration will look carefully at key industries to ensure that the benefits of competition are fully realized by consumers obama will strengthen the antitrust authorities competition advocacy programs to ensure that special interests do not use regulation to insulate themselves from the competitive process obama will also strengthen competition advocacy in the international community as well as domestically he will take steps to ensure that antitrust law is not used as a tool to interfere with robust competition or undermine efficiency to the detriment of u s consumers and businesses he will do so by improving the administration of those laws in the u s and by working with foreign governments to change unsound competition laws and to avoid needless duplication and conflict in multinational enforcement of those laws in short an obama administration will take seriously its responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws so that all americans benefit from a growing and healthy competitive free market economy

4265251 this is a big win for both barack obama and hillary clinton
4265252 obama showed that he is a leader who unites the democratic party and he gets to do it by recognizing hillarys accomplishments in this historic race
4265253 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4265254 by any sensible reckoning this is not a story of russian aggression but of us imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of russia by a potentially hostile power

4265359 middle ear nerve damage may play a role in affecting taste in children with recurrent ear infections or chronic ear disease who get drainage tubes this damage may increase intake of fattening foods
4265360 there was a trend but not significant for recurrent ear infection to lead to overweight
4265361 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4265362 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4265363 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections

4265406 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4265407 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4265408 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4265409 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan

4265421 he is the same person but as a football player he is different the last year i was with him he threw for 3 500 yards and the next year when gary had him he completed 68 of his passes pro athletes have very fragile egos so we just have to try to get them in stride build their confidence get them to believe in themselves and to believe in the system i think thats how you get a guy back going in the right direction
4265422 its a little bit lower than it was when it was before we talk about that all the time he has a very quick release hes got a strong arm hes getting to a point in his life where he is going to start hurting his elbow hurting his shoulder if he doesnt become more mechanically sound he still has done pretty good work as far as turning the ball over
4265423 as far as the off the field issue that has my name involved in it the only thing ill say is that i received two different letters i turned them over to the league authorities as was recommended and its in their hands thats all i can tell you whoever leaked this information and put it out there did not inform me that this was going to take place

4265430 where their previous albums flirted with traditional hard rock and metal like on tracks such as
4265431 the music is thoroughly contemporary a simmering mix of rock punk and post punk
4265432 the disc is slightly dizzying dexterous and demonstrative of both a restless glee in exploring rock and roll traditionalism without being afraid to shine some modern light here and there breaking down stiff genre mummification
4265433 at a point in time when most loud rock bands rely way too much on technology to hide the fact that their songs have no substance these guys come across as sounding genuine and real
4265434 if you are looking to get a song stuck in your head all day then this band will accomplish that for you
4265435 the architects pound out song after song more like a team of blacksmiths than their literal namesake together they fan the flames of discontent and determination that fuel their songs their recorded material delivers the same invigorating onslaught of sweat substance and sneering epithets as their live performances fire up these songs on the way to work and back home whether you hunker down in a cubicle schlep behind a counter serving the pubic or whatever pays the bills the architects remind you that to have a life worth living a paycheck worth earning and a love worth losing you run the risk of pain and redemption regret and reward or nasty visions of revenge listen to the drum beat and the sheer energy coursing through the guitar out of the speaker and into those patient eardrums musically these guys solidly hammer their message home with finely wrought craftsmanship and rock star swagger in the capable hands of the architects rock and roll gets a bruising brawling slap in the face
4265436 genre old fashioned rock n roll with a shot of adrenaline sounds like a present day collective of thin lizzy the jam and ac dc with van halen on vocals band of brothers siblings brandon zach and adam phillips played together as ska punk outfit the gadjits for more than a decade before forming this rock quartet in 2004 not to miss too witty for his own good brandon phillips well crafted lyrics and clever storytelling
4265437 daddy wore black a cautionary tale about a drug dealer comes off like a midwestern take on rancids time bomb and oklahoma is a bloody country punk revenge story a tale of a crooked sheriff who gets whats coming to him it recalls a more boyish social distortion new boots and truncheons cements the architects as cheerleaders for the underdogs with its celebration of street protests turning into brawls its an all american version of the rolling stones street fighting man updates for the 21st century fighting a losing battle against riot police never sounded so fun and thats really what makes this such a great album

4265470 so you think that money is the root of all evil
4265471 have you ever asked what is the root of money
4265472 when you accept money in payment for your effort you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others
4265473 but you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak
4265474 to trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will
4265475 money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants money will not give him a code of values if hes evaded the knowledge of what to value and it will not provide him with a purpose if hes evaded the choice of what to seek
4265476 only the man who does not need it is fit to inherit wealth the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started
4265477 money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause
4265478 let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably the man who respects it has earned it
4265479 run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil
4265480 but money demands of you the highest virtues if you wish to make it or to keep it
4265481 then you will see the rise of the men of the double standard the men who live by force yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue
4265482 do you wish to know whether that day is coming
4265483 whenever destroyers appear among men they start by destroying money for money is mens protection and the base of a moral existence
4265484 when you have made evil the means of survival do not expect men to remain good
4265485 you stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you while youre damning its life blood money
4265486 to the glory of mankind there was for the first and only time in history a
4265487 if you ask me to name the proudest distinction of americans i would choose because it contains all the others the fact that they were the people who created the phrase to
4265488 yet these were the words for which americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents
4265489 im looking forward to expanding the ways we interact with our audience
4265490 hopefully our convention webcasts will offer cbsnews com and cnet com users valuable information in a fun and easily accessible way

4265495 i dont think im better than everyone else i know i am
4265496 theres no doubt about it we picked up several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels and probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
4265497 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
4265498 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
4265499 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
4265500 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
4265501 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
4265502 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and theyre made out of meat
4265503 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
4265504 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take long do you have any idea whats the life span of meat
4265505 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
4265506 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
4265507 oh theres a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat thats what ive been trying to tell you
4265508 youre not understanding are you youre refusing to deal with what im telling you the brain does the thinking the meat
4265509 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
4265510 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you beginning to get the picture or do i have to start all over
4265511 thank you finally yes they are indeed made out of meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
4265512 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentiences swap ideas and information the usual
4265513 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anybody home that sort of thing
4265514 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
4265515 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
4265516 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
4265517 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the universe without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
4265518 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
4265519 i agree one hundred percent whats there to say hello meat hows it going but will this work how many planets are we dealing with here
4265520 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they can only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
4265521 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
4265522 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you probed youre sure they wont remember
4265523 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
4265524 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
4265525 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
4265526 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again

4265528 this study further supports the beneficial impact of a low risk lifestyle on the primary prevention of chronic disease and long term well being
4265529 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 lower risk of coronary heart disease and 90 lower risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes
4265530 the population attributable risk most likely underestimates the burden of unhealthy behavior on risk of stroke in the general population because the prevalence of these low risk factors and more important the prevalence of extreme levels of unhealthy behaviors are greater in the us population than in our cohorts
4265531 greater benefit is likely to be gained by adherence to healthy lifestyle choices in populations with less healthy lifestyle than in these populations of health professionals

4265627 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4265628 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future
4265629 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4265630 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4265632 wanted to put out there that she wasnt this wind up doll that went on stage and let the campaign continue out of some sort of craven ambition but that she really was going through a lot of anguish
4265633 what was the most important thing they wanted to convey on her behalf
4265634 i think that she had hoped that her statement on friday night would be the end of it for her and was surprised and a little taken aback by how many questions already came up
4265635 she thought her forgiving him should be enough for everybody else and she was unprepared for the amount of disgust and how swiftly everything else he had done in his career would be wiped away and that shes really reeling from that and afraid for what it will do to their legacy as a couple and what their children will inherit
4265636 the campaign had already gone through its official launch they were in the middle of this tour and she felt sort of trapped he was a candidate and then he drops this bombshell on her and only in pieces he told the truth slowly so she you know didnt have all the information to make the decision right away and she was in shock
4265637 well the people that you know i spoke to her brother and her best friend didnt want to feed any of the voyeuristic aspects of this story so they were really careful not to get into those kinds of details just that she was in pain and that it was a difficult decision
4265638 didnt want to feed any of the voyeuristic aspects of this story
4265639 lastly did he tell her about the baby that he claims is not his
4265640 that was really what she wanted most out of him going public to knock down those reports so they could get the truth out and get on with her life
4265641 do you think well she you say she believes him about the child unequivocally
4265642 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4265643 dairy in whatever form in moderate amounts as your mom said definitely makes a lot of sense
4265644 the consumption of animal protein particularly milk stimulates the production and action of insulin like growth factor 1 which promotes greater linear growth in children thus insulin like growth factor 1 may support bone formation and help to offset the renal loss of calcium that may be associated with protein intake

4266027 unfortunately weve had probably the worst rainy summer weve had in recent memory in july the rainfall was double of what it was the previous year in august up to today weve had only one rain free day
4266028 i like to come here a lot its a nice place to relax its amazingly high now its washed a lot of stuff up and made it a little dirty but its still enjoyable
4266029 its been a lousy summer for making money as a lifeguard rain does not bring people to the beach
4266030 we were closed more than we were open we would open for a few hours and it would rain and we would close its been a very poor summer this summer
4266031 usually i come five or six times a summer its a really nice beach but this summer its only my second time because of a lot of rain and the water wasnt nice this year we usually have more sand
4266032 you know im feeling pretty good it has been a long recovery and i feel a lot better today than i did certainly six months ago
4266033 it was a horrible thing that nobody wants to go through and nobody deserves to go through but if you look beyond that you see that something is working for you when everything falls into place and you can wake up months later and have your daughters that is special
4266034 im not into the victim role i am going to live the way i want to live
4266035 i can imagine other people are thinking how do people get through that and now we know how which is the strength that you already had that you didnt know you had are what come to the forefront
4266036 it is still carmen i mean something incredible has happened to her to all of us but mainly to her and yet she is still the same woman

4266041 we have a strong case we have two eyewitnesses who have provided sworn statements
4266042 these two crimes expose him to about 3 and half years of jail time which the state will more than likely be seeking
4266043 you wrote a letter of apology to your daughter is that right
4266044 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home

4266052 folks are saying lucas oil stadium is going to be a special place so i think the cache of lucas oil stadium is going to attract a lot of events that otherwise perhaps would not have looked at indianapolis
4266053 as time plays out and we see these major conventions the hotels coming up that will come up the development here as we move a little further south into downtown indianapolis
4266054 i dont think theres any question that well see more development in this part of downtown indianapolis the development will stretch a little further south to be close to the action here around lucas oil stadium
4266055 this early execution to me was almost a breath of fresh air
4266056 i feel like in my heart this is someone whos actually admitting to their crime
4266057 we get tips every day on zenaida gonzalez they have over a thousand zenaida gonzalezes that are linked to the places that casey told them to look so it does take time to search through private individuals are doing it authorities are doing it private investigators are doing it family members are doing it
4266058 one of those tips is going to say hey i know exactly where caylee is at and its probably going to be a very covert operation
4266059 move out of my way unless you want to get knocked over
4266060 unless you hear it from us or the police its not true
4266061 we are only going to state the facts anything else is speculation
4266062 web sites are so good at first access content youve really got to play to the strengths of the media if you want to know about a great game first probably the webs the best place to go but our readers have always said in surveys that the main reason they buy us for is for reviews reading a review in print is still quite nice and print has such a legacy of respect which is one of the reasons we keep coming back
4266063 i think this is really about tapping into both online andoffline
4266064 i think thatsalso a big part of what marketers want to do
4266065 so most departments will no longer have to take the bulk of their recyclables outside their immediate office area
4266066 in an audit conducted last year we found that up to 36 percent of the weight of the garbage cans on campus consisted of fluids with the average being 15 percent
4266067 in an effort to save money reduce contamination of our recyclables and keep garbage and recycling containers cleaner we are asking people to consume or use all of the liquids in the beverage containers or empty them out in a kitchen or bathroom sink
4266068 the reduction in liquids is also extremely helpful to custodial staff and members of the recycling crew who have to handle the garbage and recycling containers both of which can weigh significantly more with liquid in them
4266069 instead of sending your cartridges back to hewlett packard by way of ups or holding on to non hewlett packard cartridges asu stores will now pick up all cartridges from your department
4266070 thanks to the work of dozens of asu staff students and faculty including ellen newell ted woods kerry suson fernando reyna bonny bentzin and norman rollins who have attended countless committee meetings arranged contracts gotten approval for various facets of the program found vendors worked out logistics and secured funds and to waste management our trash and recycling vendor asu will have a brand new recycling program
4266071 we are participating in the transmission of an historic event while at the same time showing the power and capacity of our new platform
4266072 were bringing the power of online video to millions of eyes throughout europe and extending a great partnership with digotel
4266073 man i really gotta lose my chick in the worst kind of way
4266074 i have to wear overalls because i have no ass now
4266075 if you cant do the big attacks do the small attacks do smaller attacks and more of them
4266076 i propose you start with those that have blood on their hands torturing and suppressing muslims like high ranking intelligence officers the governor or any foreign official
4266077 you know it used to be that the face of al qaeda was bin laden and the core that is still the case but now we are reminded about al qaeda on a regular basis more because of the activities of the local cells
4266078 what this does more than anything else is provides people who are inclined to carry out such attacks with the sense that they now have some information and pushes them to actually go through with it
4266079 we have vulnerabilities absolutely in an open society youre going to have vulnerabilities
4266080 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4266081 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4266082 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4266083 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4266084 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4266085 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4266086 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4266087 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4266088 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4266089 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4266090 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4266091 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4266092 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4266093 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4266094 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4266095 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4266096 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4266097 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4266098 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4266099 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4266100 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4266101 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4266102 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4266103 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4266104 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4266105 look at them until they notice you and hope for the best
4266106 i never had any idea how to talk to girls until a year or so ago
4266107 i still come out with trivial crap when im flirting but i like to think im doing it in a faintly endearing way
4266108 the whole kiss between ron and hermione will be quite uncomfortable

4266112 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4266113 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4266114 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us

4266117 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour
4266118 i dont think anyone wants to see the fun taken out of indy but i dont think most people want to see it cross the line into obscenity either
4266119 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators

4266124 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4266125 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4266126 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4266127 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4266128 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4266129 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4266130 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4266131 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4266132 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and for weddings dance is on the brain
4266133 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4266134 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4266135 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4266136 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

4266141 dear mother im not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house and im not saying you did not take a gravy ladle but the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner
4266142 its not going to amount to a lot of money for the average person but it does send a signal that we are committed to live within our means
4266143 it wouldnt be right to sit on a larger pot of money than is necessary when the cost of gas is what it is
4266144 this is an expense im not sure the public ought to be paying for
4266145 we can talk about this in this meeting or that meeting
4266146 he ran a campaign that connected to real issues that people care about
4266147 there are a whole range of issues where families are facing economic pressures
4266148 those are the key issues and people are going to look for a representative who relates to those issues
4266149 people are really looking for a change people are fed up with the last seven years of the bush chaney administration and they want a member of congress whos going to be independent minded not somebody whos been in lock step with those failures over the past seven years that is going to be a key factor in this race

4266151 if you looked around this room who do you think is the one person theyre going to decide to blame
4266152 mr evans now knows where the line is and has stated that he has no intention of behaving similarly in any future case in this commonwealth accordingly the three judge panel sees no reason to take any action in this matter
4266153 it was a long and arduous piece of collateral litigation but i am very happy as is my client that it ended as successfully as it did
4266154 in my opinion there was nothing else they could have done
4266155 winning is always good and it is even better when your own reputation is on the line as my team tries cases around the country there is always a risk of running afoul of a judge i am just glad that in the end the pennsylvania superior court vacated the trial courts decision and then a three judge trial court discharged the show cause order on revocation
4266156 mckenna long amp aldridge llp has a national litigation practice and thus not seeing this through was never an option we are pleased that the revocation order was vacated in its entirety and the three judge panel decided that no further action beyond the superior court opinion was appropriate
4266157 i will be much more careful about making sure that i dont even go near the line
4266158 i didnt see anything that came close to mr evans violating the law
4266159 i didnt see any violation of the rules of professional conduct and i didnt see any violation by mr evans of any admonition or warning by the court that mr evans conduct was in some way lapsing from the standards that the court expected from mr evans
4266160 just the contrary the kinds of techniques and themes that are used regularly in american courtrooms and trial advocacy courses

4266167 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are for all intents and purposes because of some timing they are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
4266168 theres no doubt that general motors realized the importance of positive media coverage with the prius
4266169 its an opportunity to change the way we consume energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
4266170 this news was surprisingly tough for me i spent so much time with that guy hours and hours side by side with him listening to the hawks get beat
4266171 well pete theres the 7 452nd time that play didnt work
4266172 the funny thing about beating the chinese is that two hours later you get a craving to go out and beat them again
4266173 one judge is quite like another the only differences may be in the state of their digestions or their proclivities for sleeping on the bench for myself i can digest pig iron and while i might appear to doze occasionally you will find that i am easily awakened particularly if shaken gently by a good lawyer with a nice point of law

4266176 oh the government has decided to raise the tax on alcopops as a measure against binge drinking while saving some money for the federal budget
4266177 we dont like the governments idea its a shite because well it sucks in our view and is sure to um make the sky fall on us because of er inflationary pressures oh and it will also cause a locust plague due to rising interest rates
4266178 good communication practice on the internet is not something one learns but something one practices so as to teach others less familiar than yourself how it is done netiquette describes good and bad conduct in online communication u nderstanding why and how netiquette operates is more than just learning the rules we all must exercise an ethic of maintenance taking responsibility for doing it right what defines right it seems to apply almost entirely to communication email online chat and so on perhaps this fact suggests a difference between the kind of info communication practice involved in website creation and use and that involving direct communication lines we feel that bad netiquette really does waste our time and affect us a poorly designed website doesnt do more than prompt us to move on to the next one

4266202 we want to engage the community involve them and that will help drive the process
4266203 in 2006 there was a similar campaign to the current one in brazil in argentina
4266204 the presence of hcg in various samples of the vaccine used against rubella were discovered the suspicion that brought about the investigation was caused by the fact that there were very few cases of the disease in argentina which didnt merit a large scale campaign
4266205 the age of the people who will be vaccinated is 12 to 49 years for women reproductive age and between 12 and 39 for men
4266206 the ages for women are the same as those who received the vaccines in nicaragua where they included a hormone that sterilizes the woman who receives it and similar to the age of those who received another sterilizing hormone in the philippines
4266207 if the campaign goal is really to eliminate rubella then why vaccinate those already vaccinated
4266208 why compel the vaccination of those that had the illness in the past it is a fact more than proven that an individual who has had rubella in the past will never have it again
4266209 in the mass vaccination campaigns in argentina nigeria philippines and other countries unicef showed that it knows how to unite the worse intentions to the most angelic appearances
4266210 in brazil we have the assurance of temporao that the mass vaccination campaign is only for protecting babies and helping families

4266212 let us play the man a trick we will hide his shoes and conceal ourselves behind those bushes and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them
4266213 we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor but you are rich and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man put a coin into each shoe and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him
4266214 are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick
4266215 you have taught me a lesson which i will never forget
4266216 the point is no matter how full your schedule is if you try really hard you can always fit some more things into it

4266230 the steady drum beat of double digit sales declines this year is beginning to weight more heavily on prices
4266231 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4266232 however the drop in july spread to a few more cities including the previously untouchable vancouver market
4266233 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power
4266234 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4266235 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007 which was a record year for mls sales
4266236 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position

4266271 i mean roger took every opportunity i had my opportunity in the first set i couldnt make it i feel that hes a great player he can make everything
4266272 half of them they left after the first two sets with us it was quite boring we had to stay i cannot say it was really a beautiful match but it was a lot of fighting i guess some people that stayed they really enjoyed it
4266273 has jimmy taught me how to challenge line calls no hes taught me how to yell at referees no theres no really teaching line calls there wasnt a challenge when he was around
4266274 it was really tough you know it was hard to think about what you were going to do on court because you were just mentally trying to find a way to kind of make the points shorter and basically trying to find way to win but sometimes when its that hot outside your mind doesnt work properly
4266275 you decide you can also call me roger its okay
4266276 u s womens tennis is struggling a little bit i guess but we have a couple solid players namely venus williams and serena williams laughter and those two players are amazing laughter i think the best you guys have yet to see
4266277 its great playing her and everything but i dont want to see her in the quarterfinals ever again laughter its like every time i get to the quarters i have to face kim in a way ill be happy
4266278 yeah its definitely tougher on court for me smiling i mean it is really hot on the court
4266279 i love to read i love reading novels i read all the harry potter books im not reading the last one because i was crying at the last one i read im not going to read any more im too emotionally involved laughter i read like a nelson demille novel one of my favorite books is called the charm school i read this one book called gideon i read that new one that came out eragon the book was so much better than the movie i was so disappointed with the movie i was waiting like six months for the movie to come out i read a lot of that i watch tons of tv
4266280 i couldnt believe it actually i couldnt really believe that this is the way that my last aussie open was going to finish i looked up the crowd as i went out the flags aussie stuff everywhere it was an amazing atmosphere
4266281 just check the transcript from the last 16 press conferences
4266282 honeymoon was the same preparation for the season i was in maurice two week it was the same honeymoon tennis mix everything together
4266283 the media they wouldnt exaggerate something smiling are you kidding me
4266284 i came back from dinner at like 9 00pm so whatever was left of the match yeah
4266285 my performance here is better than on court no s t if there were rankings for press conferences i wouldnt have to worry about dropping out of the top five i hope
4266286 i dont know about you but i saw two great mens semifinals i saw the no 1 player beat the h e double hockey sticks out of another player i saw fernando gonz lez beat the h e double hockey sticks out of another player those were great matches today you saw the no 81 player win a great final
4266287 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
4266288 that will eventually lead to machines with lots of server capacity low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
4266289 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
4266290 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic

4266294 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4266295 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4266296 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4266297 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4266298 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4266299 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4266300 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4266301 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4266302 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4266303 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4266304 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4266305 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4266306 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement

4266323 and you can put in new people but unless congress speaks loudly on this issue and unless people are held accountable for their violations of the law for their abuse of power and their misuse of the department of justice using it as a political weapon using it as a political tool which subverted peoples rights to a fair trial which jeopardized our democracy if we dont speak loudly on this issue and hold people accountable then those new u s attorneys are not going to take this thing as seriously as they should and its likely to happen again this country doesnt need that

4266330 wells does not have a water extraction ordinance of any kind

4266337 it is very humbling to be the one who needs help and need to accept it
4266338 at the opening ceremony it sunk in that i really had to walk 60 miles
4266339 i left my water bottle behind at lunch i realized after a mile or so and turned back to get it

4266359 kything is a conscious act of spiritual presence a communion and connection a deep resonance a deep flowing together kything is something most people have a natural talent for and can develop it further for some it is similar to spiritual intuition intuition on a spiritual level enables one to tune in on the inner core of being of another person transcending the external aspects of the personality this level of intuition may be cultivated by an attitude of loving acceptance a suspension of judgment and a non analytic empathetic understanding many people have been kything for years except that they may have never had a word to describe their experience
4266360 for many years after my conversion i never used any ready made forms except the lords prayer in fact i tried to pray without words at all not to verbalize the mental acts even in praying for others i believe i tended to avoid their names and substituted mental images of them i still think the prayer without words is best if one can really achieve it but i now see that in trying to make it my daily bread i was counting on a greater mental and spiritual strength than i really have to pray successfully without words one needs to be at the top of ones form otherwise the mental acts become merely imaginative or emotional acts and a fabricated emotion is a miserable affair when the golden moments come when god enables one to really pray without words who but a fool would reject that gift

4266383 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4266384 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4266385 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4266386 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4266387 all this does it says we swept the families away we pretend that gadhafi never blew up an american plane
4266388 the agreement provides some justice and closure for the victims of libyan terrorism and their families
4266389 but it is small consolation and will not bring back the lives that have been lost nor undo the suffering endured by survivors
4266390 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4266391 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever

4266395 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4266396 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4266397 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4266398 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4266399 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4266422 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4266423 when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
4266424 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about us 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us

4266482 they kept whispering in my ear to ask why i wasnt smiling i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married i pleaded with them to help me escape but no one saw anything wrong in what was happening i begged my husband not to marry me but he told me i had no choice
4266483 it was disgusting awful i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender inside it killed me inside life became meaningless i had my childhood taken away and missed out on all my teenage years sometimes i still wonder if its worth trying to have a future many days im not at all sure it is
4266484 ahead of the cpi report i am looking for opportunities to sell call premium against a large spike in the long bond the market has experienced several large ranging days but hasnt made a lot of progress throughout the week this tells me that there may be a lot of pent up momentum looking for a reason to be exposed
4266485 the wide ranging days that we have been seeing in the stock market appear to be the product of market jitters combined with light volume trade ahs become somewhat more rational on the down days but investors remain fickle and it may be that way for several months i dont expect any large moves on the upside until we get closer to the election it is often the case that equities remain relatively range bound ahead of an election and then make its move once the uncertainty has been mitigated as uncertainty looms so will the market

4266500 i thought that the first 20 minutes we were pressing it a little bit
4266501 i thought we were giving the ball away and being too direct
4266502 i loved how the team responded to come back and quickly score a goal i think our finishing just needed to be better in the first half and need to be a little better defensively
4266503 in the second half i thought we made the corrections we needed to make
4266504 iupui did a great job attacking through our middle in the first half and we closed it up in the second we were more patient and calm with the ball and we were able to get a lot of good chances

4266511 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4266512 a lot of guys came with the same passion the same hunger from that night and we didnt forget how well they played against us
4266513 we just play basketball we dont try to send messages
4266514 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound
4266515 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4266516 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4266517 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4266518 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4266519 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4266520 oh fuck so fucking hung over my fucking head hurt like hell
4266521 sir furbies are a scourge on the planet and all of them must be destroyed i took it apart to understand how to better destroy them

4266523 go go go she went that way shes looking for you
4266524 create greater levels of interagency coordination and to coordinate state agency efforts with the efforts of state and local entities addressing homelessness
4266525 because its going to be really hard for you to meet your target of cutting homelessness by half if you keep counting them as homeless
4266526 well that would be very artificial they are homeless so we will count them as homeless and well just have to reduce homelessness in real ways
4266527 we hope the suspicion that fascism is being reborn in a different form proves to be untrue

4266531 there is war on the roadways of the entire world
4266532 thats that whole trying to overcome some of the negativity about downtown so what do you do
4266533 i think if you get a couple of good key businesses in here the others will come

4266535 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4266536 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4266537 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4266538 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4266539 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4266540 we must be conscious that there is a war on the roadways of the entire world where every day hundreds of people die for many different reasons
4266541 speedy intervention is needed to reduce the number of victims because this is real destruction it will not be easy but it is a challenge that we should face with great determination
4266542 one day will be devoted to each of the four sub sectors for which guidance is needed the first day will be dedicated to road users truckers automobile drivers those who travel by train and all who work in transportation related services the second to women on the streets the third to children on the streets and the fourth to the homeless
4266543 the most important thing to keep in mind is that the church is committed to raising awareness and regaining a sense of responsibility in those who use the road to decrease traffic accidents the contribution of the christian community is necessary but in addition to the church schools families and institutions must also work to further this cause and work to create respect for applicable laws
4266544 the scary statistics we hear on the television and read in the daily newspapers that demonstrate a lack of respect for life
4266545 that is why we have called this summit in october in bogot to look for a way to confront the problem it will begin with the continental conference and will later focus on the parish and diocesan environments another important topic tied to the street is that of children being forced to beg or rummage through garbage
4266546 the immaculate virgin preserved free from all stain of original sin was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory when her earthly life was over and exalted by the lord as queen over all things
4266547 not being a psychologist maybe i shouldnt say what i am about to say
4266548 the general feeling is the loss of that facility in our area and also in the state is an important issue
4266549 we are disappointed at this decision which will have repercussions not only for the parents of the students at the school but right though the mullewa community of which the school is an active part
4266550 the accused is a risk to the community due to evidence of offending in all areas he was attached to in nsw
4266551 he has restrictions placed upon him concerning pastoral duties involving children due to a previous conviction police alleged
4266552 the accused is working in a catholic library situated opposite the local catholic school
4266553 the following allegations outline 18 victims of various child sex offences police said in their statement to the court
4266554 these offences occurred at st pius x high school the charlestown parish and taree parish
4266555 police will also be reliant upon evidence of similar facts pertaining to offences committed at waverley college by a further complainant
4266556 weve obtained statements that support the offences that were putting before the court and weve certainly had that support and the involvement of a number of victims and witnesses
4266557 within a decade much of this nations preaching stock could be either retired or doddering into old age
4266558 and the reason is the 7 100 ministers aged 50 plus are backed up by just 5 300 aged 35 50
4266559 what we need is a 457 visa class designed to snare religious ministers from overseas this process would be known as vicar nicking
4266560 the probable outcome is that over the next decade ministers will not retire en masse no pun intended rather they will soldier on not so much out a sense of duty to the almighty but because their services will be in hot demand they will not be allowed to retire by their needy congregation
4266561 as baby boomers descend into the abyss that lies beyond 60 and hurtle towards the blinding light of 70 they will seek out the services of spiritual advisers
4266562 the majority of pilgrims expressed a strong faith and of those who were not yet at that point many seemed to be seekers like the centurion in the gospel who went looking for jesus when asked if he believed in him he replied lord i believe help my unbelief
4266563 the survey revealed what pilgrims most wanted at wyd was a spiritual experience and in that context to see and listen to the holy father
4266564 their hopes for what they would gain from wyd were in the same vein most of all they said they wanted a closer relationship with god and jesus they wanted to really live what they believe and to have a stronger sense of what it means to be catholic
4266565 was the strength of the younger groups spirituality wed got the impression from previous research and from some interviews that quite a few pilgrims especially the younger ones were not much involved with their local church however that seemed to be the case with only about a quarter of the younger group nearly half of them were regular church attenders had a strong faith and a firm sense of catholic identity they were a lot more involved in the life of faith than was typical for catholics their age what the survey told us was that underneath the youthful exuberance most of them had a core of solid commitment
4266566 there is war on the roadways of the entire world

4266569 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4266570 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4266571 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4266572 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4266573 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4266574 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4266575 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4266576 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4266577 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4266578 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4266579 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4266580 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4266581 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4266582 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4266583 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4266584 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4266585 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4266586 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4266587 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4266588 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4266589 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4266590 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4266591 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4266592 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4266593 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4266594 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4266595 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4266596 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4266597 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4266598 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4266599 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4266600 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4266601 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4266602 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4266603 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4266604 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4266605 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4266606 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4266607 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4266608 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4266609 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4266610 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4266612 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4266613 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4266614 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4266615 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4266616 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4266617 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4266618 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4266619 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4266620 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4266621 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4266622 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4266623 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4266624 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4266625 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4266626 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4266627 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4266628 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4266629 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4266630 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4266631 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4266632 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4266633 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4266645 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4266646 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings

4266651 feels no guilt about encouraging her supporters to mess up obamas big moment thus undermining his odds of beating john mccain and improving her odds of being the nominee in 2012
4266652 its the only thing he could do when the office gave him late case law information its frustrating but i dont blame the judge
4266653 anytime theres a delay in a court case its frustrating
4266654 but id much rather have the court make a ruling in accordance with the law for a small delay than a judge make the wrong decision
4266655 we wanted to move forward find out the truth and eventually get some closure
4266656 protecting the integrity of our nations critical infrastructure is among ices highest priorities
4266657 when individuals use fraudulent social security numbers to get jobs they hide their true identity and history we need to know who is working on our critical infrastructure sites
4266658 the need is for a great foreign policy president of the quality of truman or reagan to win a long war begun by our enemies we are going to need more than an attractive but essentially empty vessel
4266659 persuasive reasons were given to elect sen john mccain he has presidential credentials our troops and veterans have the greatest respect for him world leaders know him and understand that he is a man of solid principals
4266660 is no longer what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
4266661 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
4266662 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
4266663 it also appears and i tend to believe this based on reader mail that some savvy individuals who had leaned toward obama actually decided to do some cursory research on the candidate
4266664 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
4266665 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black

4266708 one of the big problems they now face in other countries is the people in power want to reserve the money keep it for themselves so they exclude young able people who want to join their team

4266763 this sunday on pay per view its the biggest blockbuster of the summer that being summerslam and the action is expected to be nothing but sizzling here is a look at the matches
4266764 jeff hardy will be set for one on one action as he faces mvp this rivalry started on the july 25th edition of smackdown when hardy was a guest on the vip lounge when mvp took all kinds of shots at him calling his behavior wreckless and that he was a detriment to his friends and family which led the wwes franchise playa being tossed from the vip set the following week hardy was at ringside as mvp was taking on jimmy wang yang after that match was over hardy took his anger out on mvp with a twist of fate for months mvp claims that he has been feeling underutilized on friday nights hes now in the limelight with his match against hardy but will mvp learn a hard lesson of respect from jeff hardy or will mvp get the credit he has been craving we will find out this sunday
4266765 then in a winners take all intergender tag team match santino marella and the glamazon beth phoenix will take on the intercontinental champion kofi kingston and the wwe womens champion mickie james the winning team gets both the intercontinental championship as well as the wwe womens championship i think that kingston and james may have an adavantage in this match because kingston and james have been proud defenders of their respective championships there has also been a strange love affair between santino and the glamazon if they are going to win this match the glamazon and santino are going to have to put their feelings for each other provided there is any aside and remain well in focus but then again this love affair could be part of a master plan
4266766 then in a match for the ecw championship the champion mark henry will defend against matt hardy hardy won the right to face henry after winning a fatal 4 match against finlay john morrison and the miz even though he lost the united states championship to shelton benjamin at the great american bash he is more determined than ever to rise to the top of the mountain but to do that hell have to smash right through the worlds strongest champion the only thing that hell keep his eye on is wwe hall of famer tony atlas being at ringside he may have a trick or two up his sleeve in order for henry to keep his championship
4266767 also this sunday at summerslam the heartbreak kid shawn micheals will make an announcement in tegards to the future of his wrestling career hbk is currently suffering from a detached retina at the hands of chris jericho when he sent micheals through the jeri tron 6000 the two fought frequently on raw including a match at the great american bash in which jericho went to work on hbks injured right eye the friday before summerslam hes going for a medical evaluation and this sunday he will let us all know if the career of one of the most decorated wwe superstars in history continues or it is over for shawn micheals i hope not because i want to see hbk get some payback on jericho
4266768 then for the world heavyweight championship the champion cm punk will defend against john bradshaw layfield jbl won the right to face punk at summerslam in a last second fluke during a 2 on 1 handicap match with chris jericho ever since punk cashed in his money in the bank briefcase and winning the world heavyweight championship punk has proved that he is more than a paper champion defending against the likes of the animal batista and jbl himself on two different occasions will the third time be the charm of the self made millionaire or will punks seemingly improbable reign as champion continue we will find out this sunday
4266769 then it will be the rated r superstar edge taking on the undertaker in a hell in a cell match the undertaker who had been banished from the wwe after one night stand was brought back by smackdown general manager vickie guererro after she saw a video tape of edge and her wedding planner alicia fox engaging in a kiss guererro did accept edges heartfelt apology but then reminded him that hell have no fury than a womans scorn when she broke the news to edge i hope that edge will look at some video tapes of past hell in a cell matches that involved the undertaker and studies them carefully
4266770 then in a match for the wwe championship the champion triple h will defend against the great khali khali won the right to face the game by winning a biggest blockbuster of the summer battle royal after he won the match triple h came down to the ring and the two gave each other a massive staredown with neither one showing a trace of fear ever since coming back to smackdown after 6 years triple h has made his presence known and fears no one its going to take a hell of a lot of quickness in order for triple h to chop the great khali down to size
4266771 then in a match that is in my opinion the main event for the first time ever john cena will go one on one with the animal batista these two are the two most powerful forces in the wwe this started when cena accidently punched batista after a skirmish with jbl that led to the two trading blows one week later the hard feelings were subsided as the two shook hands at the beginning of raw but the truce was short lived when both cena and batista felt that they each deserve a shot at the world heavyweight championship at summerslam and the only way to settle that is for the two to have a match and the winner faces cm punk for the world heavyweight championship at summerslam but shane mcmahon came out and told that the yet to be revealed gm made a match as cena and batista would take on jbl and kane after cena and batista won the match it was revealed that mike adamle was the new raw gm and adamle made the match for summerslam pitting john cena against batista a week later cena and batista took on ted dibiase and cody rhodes for the world tag team championship cena and batista became the new world tag team champions putting another twist on the confrontation the following week cena and batista let their friction get the best of them as they lost the tag team championship back to dibiase and rhodes tensions got bigger as a result of the loss as the two were in a heated brawl im not going to make a prediction as to who is going to win the match because this match can go either way all i can say is this match has classic written all over it
4266772 after reading erroneous reports about tom cruise and united artists i would like to clarify that we are honored that he will continue as our full partner in control of ua he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
4266773 its very confusing and we really dont know if its 100 safe
4266774 im not against vaccines but i dont want to do anything that would harm my daughter
4266775 we dont know if it will make a difference in the ultimate rates of cancer
4266776 the jury is still out on how much benefit were actually going to get with this vaccine
4266777 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
4266778 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
4266779 even though it guards against two hpv strains the other hpv types need to be taken into account
4266780 it will take a long time before we know the true efficacy of the vaccine
4266781 if we vaccinate every single 12 year old it should reduce by half the number of cervical cancers in the next 35 years
4266782 the cdc and the fda checked out these reports very carefully
4266783 and weve done calculations for the number of cases reported and the number of cases that youd find in the general population and we have not found an increase
4266784 you can actually prevent these infections and the cervical abnormalities that require more invasive interventions
4266785 me dieron a elegir entre dos casas en las villas les pregunt a mis amigos paraguayos en cu l les parec a a ellos que me pod a quedar en ninguna me dijeron porque nosotros necesitamos de alguien que est en buenos aires y nos defienda tampoco esta vez pude llegar a a cumplir mi deseo

4266787 much in common with other sect builders of the socialist left
4266788 bookchin never used the word sect to describe his efforts and surely would have rejected it
4266789 a separate group adhering to a distinctive doctrine or way of thinking or to a particular leader a school of philosophy or of philosophic opinion a group holding similar political economic or other views
4266790 bookchin seemed relish in his own isolation as if it were a sign of grace
4266791 these remarks created a tragic aura around him and the feeling that we should treasure every moment with him
4266792 did not create a new revolutionary doctrine that was adequate to his aims or one for instance that possessed the transformative force of marxism
4266793 work simply lacks the coherence and subtlety necessary to register on that scale
4266794 create a new revolutionary doctrine that was adequate to his aims
4266795 judge bookchin according to the standards that he set for himself
4266796 the strengths and weaknesses in bookchins particular approach to revolutionary organizing
4266797 an intelligentsia should study organic societies if it wants to render nature self conscious
4266798 honor our evolutionary heritage we must create a society whose metabolism with the natural world is ecologically sound and whose internal relationships are democratic and decentralized it is solely these social forms that possess the wholeness and freedom that life requires
4266799 a ccording to bookchin we approximated this in our early history while living in what he called organic societies
4266800 forms of organization in which the community is united by kinship ties and by common interest in dealing with the means of life
4266801 not yet divided into the classes and bureaucracies based on exploitation we find in hierarchical society
4266802 at no point in my discussion did i suggest we can return to aboriginal lifeways in fact i was at pains to warn against any belief that we can or should do so
4266803 i f we are to achieve an ecological society in the future it will have to enriched by the insights knowledge and data we have acquired as a result of the long history of philosophy science technology and rationality
4266804 in addressing the sources of our present social and ecological problems
4266805 perhaps the most fundamental message that social ecology advances is that the very
4266806 most fundamental route to a resolution of our ecological problems is social in character
4266807 until domination as such is removed from social life and replaced by a truly egalitarian and sharing society powerful ideological technological and systemic forces will be used by the existing society to degrade the environment indeed the entire biosphere
4266808 the freedom of humanity implies the liberation of nature through humanity by what means and criteria and means can we reenter natural evolution
4266809 no less a humanization of nature than a naturalization of humanity
4266810 not only the environment of humanity it is its destiny
4266811 what is most useful in marxs work over to the libertarian arena
4266812 developing with the material conditions that shape society as a whole
4266813 is not atavistic to cull from history the ways in which people developed humanistic lifeways and realistic institutions that could provide workable examples for developing a free society
4266814 however instead of building upon this early achievement we made a tragic departure from our evolutionary itinerary
4266815 i n the intermediate zone between first non human nature and second human social evolution began to assume a highly aberrant form
4266816 to speak concretely in the intermediate zone between first nature and second
4266817 t his voluntarism was consistent with bookchins broader view of historical development
4266818 b rilliant as a theory of the material preconditions for socialism
4266819 it is not being that determines consciousness but consciousness that determines being
4266820 it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness
4266821 in the social production of their existence men inevitably enter into definite relations which are independent of their will namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production
4266822 a period of transformation by its consciousness but on the contrary this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production
4266823 no social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society
4266824 past revolutions internally from within their own inner dynamics rather than externally from the standpoint of where we are today
4266825 working with the teleological conviction that what now exists had to come into existence
4266826 consider the high ideals that emerged in past revolutions as merely an ideological patina for uncontrollable economic forces that determined human behavior irrespective of human wishes and desires
4266827 i have avoided viewing the intentions of these movements as reflecting the emergence and consolidation of industrial capitalism rather i have taken the demands of the various revolutionary tendencies at their word i believe that the great mass of people who made the revolutions described in this work genuinely believed in the notions of liberty equality fraternity and the pursuit of happiness that they articulated not necessarily in free trade a ruthless egotism or class collaboration contrary to the retrospective interpretations that have been given to their liberatory slogans
4266828 advanced moral political and social alternatives to capitalism although they lacked any clear idea of what capitalism would become and
4266829 tried to provide the social economic cultural and political background that gave rise to and sustained its radical movement
4266830 history of all hitherto existing society has been a history of class struggles
4266831 the most fundamental message that social ecology advances is that the very
4266832 the pre history of post scarcity anarchism josef weber and the movement for a democracy of content 1947 1964
4266833 for a time sic bookchin saw the communist party as one of the worst offenders which bookchin believed sic had created a police mentality among its members
4266834 theoretical premises necessary for another bookchin sect the idea of a universal history of primary and secondary contradictions etc have not fared well in the culture at large
4266835 paul glavin walter hergt matt hern yvonne liu joe lowndes and the editors of perspectives
4266836 tendency toward hermeticism had a political logic specifically we assumed that it was not possible to build a mass movement at the present juncture given the generalized historical decline that we presumed to see around us and thus we felt compelled to address more advanced sectors of the population this sanctioned the use of very esoteric discourse and to a degree made it necessary as a bonding element in our political community
4266837 countervail the standard image of preliteral cultures as savage by emphasizing their benign aspects i wanted to shatter this ugly image of preliteral peoples and explore more fully the ancestral sources of values like care nurture and early humanitys subjectivization or personalization of nature
4266838 organic societies spontaneously evolved values that we rarely can improve
4266839 the ecological crisis socialism and the need to remake society
4266840 in nonhierarchical societies certain customs guide human behavior along basically decent lines
4266841 history civilization and progress outline for a criticism of modern relativism
4266842 in the intermediate zone between first nature and second that saw the graded passage of biological evolution into social social evolution began to assume increasingly hierarchical forms whether this could have been avoided is impossible to say and meaningless to divine in any case social evolution unfolded in the direction of hierarchical class oriented and statist institutions giving rise to the nation state and ultimately albeit not inevitably to a capitalist economy
4266843 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a
4266844 my hair looks horrible i do not know what to do with it maybe someone can cut it so i do not have to worry about it at all
4266845 mom i am sorry it is growing out and that is always an awkward stage it will be better later
4266846 can you get me bobby pins they always work great in my hair to hold it back
4266847 mom i am pulling your hair back now but bobby pins will not stay in your hair they kept sliding out when we tried it before
4266848 oh you always know so much you never believe me i know they worked i used them all the time
4266849 mom that was way back when your hair was thicker it is too thin now they slip out and there is a danger of your eye getting poked with them
4266850 i want my ears covered i hate the feel if they are not
4266851 we are getting closer to knowing who will play where
4266852 hes a gunner on punt coverage a punt returner and a safety on kickoff coverage he wants to play and help us win
4266853 i think knowshon could be pretty good at punt returner
4266854 i dont know if well pull the trigger but hes working there knowshon will do anything you ask him to do you want to put the best players at every position across the board including on special teams
4266855 but for the most part international is a decent place to work the workers have been there for years it doesnt have to be like it is at agri
4266856 i heard that whoever would sign the papers would get fired thats when i moved to get another job

4266864 remix albums have been done but we couldnt think of a rock band that had remixed itself and then played the remixes live
4266865 its like 2 many djs dance music with a punk attitude
4266866 cant get you out of my head soulwax kyluss remix
4266867 im sure randy will be thrilled to hear the news but speaking as someone who has seen this kid train from the very beginning im not surprised at all that hes ranked number one
4266868 ive been around this business for a long time and ive seen a lot of great wrestlers but ive never seen anyone work out as hard or dedicate himself to the sport quite like randy
4266869 all ive got to say is that it must be in the genes
4266870 yeah yeah i know all about the 500 youre right i dont think i was quite in randys league
4266871 we all feel very fortunate that my father randys grandfather was able to see him win a world title and become a big star
4266872 but darn it he wants to get back inside that ring he was originally expected to be out until october or november hes been working out the whole time concentrating on leg lifts and he should be able to use light weights for his upper body soon if theres a way for him to come back before october you can be sure that randy will do it
4266873 that was definitely one of the highlights of randys career
4266874 he was thrilled that he won at mania just because thats where legends are made some people would say that johns movie career and that pec injury has inadvertently helped randy but i would say that randy was trusted with that main event spot because he is an excellent ring general your pay per view is in good hands if randys carrying the ball
4266875 hey the boys just in his 20s so i think hes entitled to some mistakes
4266876 right now though randys getting ready to be a father thats his priority right now
4266877 if you want some fun heh heh heh heh take ob la di bla da
4266878 the only thing that looks good on me is you

4266947 but a spirit of independent thinking does not prevail in gods organization and we have sound reasons for confidence in the men taking the lead among us

4266949 preaching the good news of the kingdom in all the inhabited earth

4266956 me either lets get out of here i want to see your new house
4266957 yeah my parents gave it to me as kind of a consolation prize when we moved
4266958 where else are you going to sleep i dont have any sisters you could room with or anything and i dont want to have you stay in my brothers room
4266959 so how are things with you and matt what are you doing today
4266960 were going to the park actually so i have to get off the phone and eat breakfast before we go
4266961 he must have seen it blowing across the park and thought it was a squirrel or something
4266962 maybe i should start getting drunk every time i call her thats the only way i could handle talking to her
4266963 but theres no way to talk to her without wanting to pull all my hair out when im done
4266964 were never gonna find a place open tonight and how are we going to get to a hotel theres nothing around here for miles
4266965 are good luck that was the most amazing game ive ever been to
4266966 what do you want more than anything in the world right now
4266967 ill call you during the ending celebrations hopefully well both be happy about the results
4266968 im sure we will be after the game we just played we have to win the super bowl
4266969 when my girl is gone for ten days i want to remind her how great it is back home when she gets back
4266970 because i want to show you how much i missed you
4266971 and if he did it would be because i wanted to too
4266972 you promised you wouldnt cheat on me and now youre going to make it up to me
4266973 i just need a restraining order filed against him now
4266974 ive been driving all day to see you i didnt want to leave things how they were when you got on that plane
4266975 i have to leave in a few days before school starts again
4266976 you can go somewhere with a bunch of us for spring break and he can meet us there and we should get him here for prom
4266977 matt doesnt care what you wear tonight he loves you remember
4266978 this is my first time alone with matt since january i want everything to be perfect including my outfit
4266979 well were you wearing anything when you visited him that he said you looked good in
4266980 those were winter clothes lucy im talking about spring ones
4266981 youre meeting him at the beach okay and dont worry about hair and makeup do it the way you always do and youll look great
4266982 matt is going to love it but not if youre late its 8 58 go
4266983 yes okay im going to be here watching all new shows on tv i think ill be okay now go
4266984 and im sorry about earlier its just i havent seen those guys in a long time and i wanted to catch up but i also wanted us to be alone together like this
4266985 no im studying for a physics exam what about you
4266986 my brother he wanted to know how my vacations going
4266987 your brother um do you ever think hed you know think of me
4266988 you do not want to date my brother i mean i love him to death and all but luce hes had so many girlfriends i stopped teasing him about it because it was too hard to keep track he dates like three girls at once
4266989 he was probably nice to you because he thinks youre hot and because youre my best friend
4266990 i dont want either of you to be hurt and i definitely dont want to be caught between the two of you
4266991 brian is coming home in a couple weeks and lucy is actually going on a date with him
4266992 well if brians a player let lucy mess with his mind a little it might be interesting to hear about
4266993 lucy actually likes him and hes a player hes going to break her heart and i dont want to be caught between the two of them how do you decide who to side with
4266994 i just dont want lucy dating my brother theyre going to get into some huge fight and ill be caught in the middle of it
4266995 oh my god hes a total player hes going to break her heart
4266996 dont automatically assume things are going to go wrong give your brother a chance maybe hell really like lucy and wont cheat on her
4266997 yeah when theyre living in two separate cities and never see each other
4266998 yeah but unlike my brother you dont feel the need to make out with every girl you see
4266999 well tell them not to drag you into their personal problems just because youre close to both of them doesnt mean you have to take sides
4267000 its not like you set them up or anything if they get into a fight its their fault for wanting to date in the first place
4267001 just because i didnt set them up doesnt mean they wont expect me to take sides when brian breaks her heart
4267002 just tell brian that if he wants to cheat on her he should just break up with her period that should save you all a lot of heartache
4267003 we had a good time what more do you need to know
4267004 you suffering from separation anxiety from being away from your lover
4267005 i know somethings bugging you so are you going to tell me what
4267006 you wont tell me anything i just want to know what happened between you and lucy god knows i already have enough to worry about right now
4267007 ive been hoping im not pregnant so i wont have to tell him
4267008 and im too scared to buy a test so i dont know how to find out
4267009 thats a lot of ice cream for one girl youre not even eating for two
4267010 so what do i do with the pregnancy test that you dont need
4267011 keep it for when you get one of your six thousand girlfriends knocked up
4267012 well i only have one girlfriend right now and im not planning on getting her knocked up
4267013 i said i was assuming the worst so im taking this to lucy
4267014 well fine if you want to know so badly ill tell you
4267015 do you realize this is the last time ill be able to see you before you leave for college
4267016 but im going to a school thats closer to you than my house is
4267017 do you want to get married when we get out
4267018 but right now it wont do any good to look that far into the future
4267019 it happened like that it happened so fast i was like man i done been shot again i was shot in my chest back like two months ago
4267020 s omething serious need to be done not only from politician level but from people in general
4267021 how dare you how dare you what kind of friend are you
4267022 even creating the possibility that she could have misinterpreted what i said
4267023 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4267024 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4267025 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4267026 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4267027 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4267028 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4267029 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4267030 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4267031 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4267032 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4267033 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4267034 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4267035 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4267036 so whats the point the point is to make a splash
4267037 my clients experience suggests they brought an indictment without careful evaluation of the evidence
4267038 they essentially took out the entire organization in one fell swoop
4267039 i cant believe it no test even no courtroom either is that normal
4267040 for this kind of thing a courtroom is unnecessary some places probably use them but rockland is a busy city they save courtrooms for actual trials
4267041 but i was going to take you home tomorrow afternoon chad said he could handle things until then
4267042 ive got an appointment in fifteen minutes and a ten minute drive ill call and arrange a late check out and ill be at the hotel by ten after three to take you to the bus
4267043 will you be ok until then i im sorry i shouldnt have gotten so upset you didnt know
4267044 may i pay for these as well as the lotion
4267045 i dont know who you are im not going anywhere with a strange man
4267046 maam im store security and if you dont follow me well be forced to call the police and we do have the right to detain you
4267047 what i dont understand why the police what did i do because i didnt want the card i cant get a card i have no identification to prove and anyway mother didnt approve of credit
4267048 oh i do this was exciting for me once i knew that id be cleared
4267049 of course when he said something about surveillance i knew there wasnt anything to worry about since i knew i hadnt done anything wrong

4267051 im sure thats what bill arranged but i wanted to come home
4267052 i got mine from their concert in new cheltenham but you can probably get it from their website or amazon
4267053 is there a catalog i can write for oh listen
4267054 she wasnt here it was the worst feeling of my life mother always waited on the porch for me
4267055 well because the memo i got from you i might add was that you were bringing her home tomorrow afternoon had anyone bothered to tell me the plans changed i would have been there
4267056 because its not what the finley women do they do for themselves it never occurred to her to call for a ride if she wants to do something she walks period it is who willow finley is
4267057 would you mind calling me when you leave willows place
4267058 dont ever make plans for willow i keep forgetting how backward they are in some ways
4267059 dont make plans to do stuff with her she may show up she may not
4267060 bill did you make plans with willow or for her ive found her very conscientious about anything she plans
4267061 let me ask you this if you made the same plans for another one of your clients without asking their input how would they react willow may be inexperienced in the world and a tad na ve at times but shes not a child shes accustomed to making her own decisions
4267062 ive got it ill take care of it why dont you go look for some socks or a package of undershirts shes probably feeling self conscious
4267063 just show me where they go and when were done putting everything away you can help me find an outfit for tomorrow if you would
4267064 i think i have it you need a beige wrap skirt twill you want fabrics that you could have ordered if you wanted a beige skirt then you want a basic white cotton shirt wear your hair in a low bun and slip on shoes with nylons
4267065 ive got everything i need right here i left my tote bag in the car though would you hold these things while i go get mothers wallet
4267066 you can either pay me back or i can deduct it from the disbursement account
4267067 miles of asphalt thousands upon thousands of cars and of course being in this valley doesnt help youre up by the lake and have your own stream so i doubt it gets quite this hot where you are
4267068 its getting late and i need to get my car ill pick you up out front at eight ill order breakfast to arrive at seven if you tell me what you want
4267069 whatever you recommend is fine thank you for taking me to dinner
4267070 hi chad i have a problem can you help me
4267071 well ive tried everything and it wont open the door
4267072 i cant hear the cicadas here i can only hear cars and horns and sirens just get through the court hearing and then get on the bus
4267073 after court tomorrow get a cab and have it take you to the mall closest to your hotel you should find a sears or jc penneys or macys or something
4267074 oh i was at j penneys tonight i bought clothes for tomorrow or rather bill bought them for me
4267075 i have to make sure he gives me a copy of the accounts before i leave i have no idea where they are and i spent almost a hundred dollars tonight
4267076 well he paid for them because he wouldnt let me go out to the car to get mothers wallet
4267077 what about that police officer does he know how to feed chickens and milk a goat
4267078 well we cant know whatll happen with dna testing or if therell be an afternoon session ive booked a room at the rockland towers for thursday and friday nights i thought id drive you back on saturday after a trip to the zoo or something
4267079 ill bring clothes for two days but i dont promise to stay both days enjoy your dinner ill see you tomorrow evening without another word willow disappeared through the doorway and bill heard footsteps on the stairs and then returning he watched amused as she grabbed her salad plate and disappeared once more i apologize for my presumption i think i just assumed that youd want to see a little of the city since things could go late i made plans i shouldnt have been so presumptuous i should have asked please forgive me the last thing i want to do is make things uncomfortable between us thank you for a lovely afternoon i enjoyed the movie immensely and as i saw it last week and barely gave it a five you must have been the difference i have reservations at the oaks for dinner tomorrow after you arrive if youd care to go please arrive in something suitable for a fine restaurant otherwise we can go get chinese or something else if youre hungry again im sorry im very sorry bill
4267080 what an odd word to use to describe a train ride
4267081 he said the food was fine but his heart isnt
4267082 i have to start chopping wood in the mornings while willow naps
4267083 the bottles arrived today and today i milked cleo for the first time
4267084 i was running from georgian troops i want to thank the russian troops
4267085 i just play em girl i dont write em for a moment willow didnt understand why he talked as if she couldnt understand the words and then laughed again thought you were one of them tourists from places that dont have escalators
4267086 he was so nice to me i had to do something
4267087 if you drop money like that to every panhandler in rockland youll be broke in no time
4267088 well i cant give money to everyone but i could to him and im glad i did
4267089 its so big look how tall they are how can you breathe
4267090 deeper come on slowly a little deeper now you can do it
4267091 come on willow lets go inside youll feel better i think
4267092 i didnt think about how unfamiliar all of this would be it just never occurred to me that you might be overwhelmed or feel claustrophobic with the buildings i was concerned about court dealing with the traffic and such but not this i keep thinking of the weight of several more stories above me and wonder why they dont come crashing down on top of us
4267093 but that is my point every year brings decay things get weaker when will it all come crumbling down
4267094 there are buildings in this city that are over fifty years old
4267095 its a beautiful room so large for just a place to stay over night
4267096 come over here look at the city from up here maybe itll take away that closed in feeling
4267097 wow even from up here the buildings are so tall and close you get more sky but there are still a lot of really tall buildings
4267098 wow thats amazing it almost makes you dizzy but in a neat way
4267099 we might be a bit early but we can be let off a few blocks away and walk
4267100 should i choose seafood or poultry ive never had duck but i hear its oily
4267101 it is its terrible actually i love their prime rib
4267102 i eat beef so often i wanted to try something i havent ever had
4267103 order the roasted lamb with rosemary and whatever else they do to it here
4267104 thank you youre having prime rib im having the veal its incredibly good
4267105 that dress is lovely i wont ask if you made it that would be a ridiculous question i will ask however where you found such beautiful fabric when i know you and your mother only shopped by mail
4267106 mother ordered six yards of voile for decorating her room last year they sent sixteen there was some mix up about the order box not being printed right so mother fixed it and they mistook her box correction for a one
4267107 well those roses are just amazing i remember that fabric incident your mother called me from fairbury about it she wasnt sure how to pay for it without them sending more fabric
4267108 im just amazed at the cost of the fabric it wasnt very expensive but that is a very finely stitched design on there
4267109 oh i did the embroidery once the dress was made
4267110 because we had ten yards of the fabric and i wanted a pattern to my dress so i made it what would we do with ten yards of voile unless i stitched it into a dress

4267121 ill be right back i need to take a quick shower and get ready for the bus
4267122 maybe i should call and see if anyone is available to drive her
4267123 do you think this dress will work for dinner at a nice restaurant
4267124 for someone who remembered a ten digit number the first time she read it you are lousy with details
4267125 im terrible with things i hear and some things that arent number grabbing a fresh kitchen towel she squeezed her hair repeatedly and combed in between squeezes
4267126 i have these and my winter doc martens boots oh and i have tennis shoes and regular work boots
4267127 we have thirty five minutes or so to get you in town find some kind of sandals and onto a bus
4267128 theyre fine for every day wear but not for that restaurant and not for court you need something else even dressy flip flops will work well try the market first theyre faster than the shoe store

4267143 kari came into the city very rarely but she never brought willow
4267144 do i have to go mother was terrified of the city

4267146 yes now i know how to handle motion sickness and
4267147 well that one looked interesting and less than terrifying anyway

4267161 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4267162 however the drop in july spread to a few more cities including the previously untouchable vancouver market
4267163 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power
4267164 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4267165 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007 which was a record year for mls sales
4267166 this is my chance to make it all happen in one city where they say dreams come true

4267178 my familys modest financial means would have made a hotel stay very difficult my mother and i would have to endure the surgery alone
4267179 thankfully this burden was lifted from my family when the ronald mcdonald house in fargo opened its doors to my family at no cost my parents and brother were there to support me the whole time
4267180 the doctors saved my life and so did the ronald mcdonald house
4267181 the house was a sanctuary for us it made it possible for my family to stay close and keep my spirits up that made my treatment so much easier and much more successful
4267182 i was bald too and my brother always told me people love you for who you are not for your hair
4267183 then they moved to the ronald mcdonald house all their needs were taken care of and they were able to concentrate on just giving me love and attention for me it was literally a life saver

4267200 as i stood in front you last year to deliver the city budget i said that our investment in basic city infrastructure had fallen behind
4267201 our city our state and our nation have not invested as we must in roads bridges and transit and our lack of investment has serious consequences
4267202 i say this standing in a city recovering from a tragic bridge collapse that was not an act of god but a failure of man
4267203 while the decisions in this years budget are difficult there are nothing compared with what we faced in 2002 and 2003
4267204 back then the citys soaring debt was draining the money we needed for basic services like police and fire and road repair
4267205 we laid out a five year financial plan that imposed tough fiscal discipline everyone had to give something and i have to admit there were days when it seemed no one was happy we had to be tough managers and deliver a lot of bad news we asked employees to limit their pay increases and we asked city residents for more in property taxes we all shared the sacrifice
4267206 its directed at policy decisions that have been at an impasse

4267211 long before the prius hit the road and sustainability became the buzzword du jour there was sim van der ryn the intrepid pioneer of the eco frontier
4267212 the environmental movement began to integrate its traditional ideas of conservation with differing ways of living lightly on the land and the idea of sustainable communities emerged
4267213 complementary concerns included the nature of our food and farming systems the chemistry of our waste and water systems our modes of transportation in sum the kind of communities we built energy was just the tip of the iceberg then and now out of this came sim van der ryns notion of sustainable communities a concept still at the center of much needed standards for change
4267214 pioneering concepts now taken for granted from solar roof panels to rainwater catchment systems
4267215 its a pivotal time to have six of the top environmental thinkers in the world exploring the relevance of sustainable communities to the defining challenges of our time

4267222 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4267223 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4267224 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4267225 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4267226 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4267227 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4267228 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4267229 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and for weddings dance is on the brain
4267230 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4267231 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4267232 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4267233 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

4267351 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4267352 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4267353 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4267354 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4267355 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4267356 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4267357 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4267358 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4267359 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4267360 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4267361 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4267362 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work
4267363 sometimes in spite of himself he finds himself involved in policy matters by superiors who wish to take advantage of his name
4267364 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking for 1 000 years russia has belonged to such a category

4267370 sometimes they may cheer too early which will interfere with the players i hope that next time maybe they can pay attention to that

4267379 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4267380 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4267381 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4267382 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
4267383 our study adds strong evidence that cutting down helps reduce stroke risk but quitting is unquestionably the best option

4267386 the three major stakeholders in this are the army so we can shape our workforce the commander who will get a better prepared employee and then the employee who will be able to manage their sic career based on their sic desire or potential
4267387 provide alternative career paths enabling employees to cross train into other specialty areas within a career group the result will be greater opportunity and visibility of opportunity for the entire civilian workforce the vision is for each employees possibility for advancement to be commensurate with his or her own potential and desire
4267388 todays personnel system is prescriptive and reactive we want tomorrows system to be proactive and collaborative
4267389 both have spoken to or referenced the term comprehensive but havent said what that means
4267390 we want them to say condoms will be given time equal to abstinence education in terms of giving people all the tools and all the ways to protect themselves
4267391 the current administrations policies regarding sexual health education have fractured efforts to provide a cohesive structured and successful hiv aids prevention program
4267392 america needs a leader who will bring all parties to the table and put forth a plan to create a national dialog regarding hiv aids we want to hear from both candidates whether condoms will have a fair place in that discussion

4267406 im delighted its fantastic im planning a big party with my friends this means everything to me
4267407 i love maths i just enjoy working with numbers where i know there is a definite answer
4267408 the school has been excellent the teachers have worked really hard and given me lots of extra lessons and helped me with my revision if i had gone to a normal mainstream school i probably would have done all right but i wouldnt have got such good results its strange to think that i probably wouldnt have done as well as i did if i hadnt been kidnapped when i was a baby
4267409 political views on same sex couples conflict with this wisdom
4267410 maybe the catholic church are basing this statement on studies other than those found in mainstream research it seems to me that they have some odd ideas from time to time anyway such as not using condoms or birth control i dont take much notice of such statements nor do many people i know
4267411 and bring us great joy as well as all the stresses that kids bring
4267412 you have to agree on the basic principles of child rearing and maintaina consistent approach children need boundaries as much as love and they need to know that you are there for them
4267413 it is important that the children know that they are loved that you will always be there for them but also that there are boundaries and expectations of appropriate and acceptable behaviour with consequences if those expectations are not met
4267414 give lots of appropriate praise they require a sense of belonging to a family unit who loves listens to and treasures them to be good role models for your children live as you want them to be it is important for all parents to have similar general goals and expectations for the children and consistency with rules and consequences

4267417 the results from this study suggest that these similarities extend to the way in which our brains produce and process communicative signals
4267418 we didnt know if or to what extent other primates and particularly humans closest ancestor the chimpanzees possess a comparable region involved in the production of their own communicative signals
4267419 by this we are suggesting that apes are born with and use the brain areas identified here when producing signals that are part of their communicative repertoire alternatively one might argue that because our apes were captive born and producing communicative signals not seen often in the wild the specific learning and use of these signals induced the pattern of brain activation we saw this would suggest that there is tremendous plasticity in the chimpanzee brain as there is in the human brain and that the development of certain kinds of communicative signals might directly influence the structure and function of the brain
4267420 were going out to america and asking those who have foreign language skills to come and use them in support of the u s government
4267421 the defense department and the federal government at large have spent a lot of money developing language maintenance and enhancement technology
4267422 were capitalizing on the technology thats already developed and making it available
4267423 general dynamics has assembled an outstanding team of consultants and subcontractors to represent all the expertise we need to build this language testing marketing and human resources
4267424 we looked at other agencies to determine what their needs might be
4267425 were working to understand how other agencies can use this corps of people and bring them in when there are national needs

4267430 within a couple of generations ket will probably become extinct
4267431 only na dene languages have a system of verb prefixes that very closely resemble the yeniseic
4267432 i systematically connect these structures in yeniseic with the structures in modern na dene
4267433 my comparisons arent just lists of some look alike words i show there is a system behind it
4267434 there are so many things that can influence why we have an accent for example how your parents spoke and how much you identify with your parents
4267435 were going to look at the brain anatomy of people who have voice artist skills to see if parts of their brains are slightly larger than people who havent got these skills
4267436 i want to find out why some people are better at doing accents than others
4267437 only half of the activations in the brain were to do with the speech and language areas the voice is not just coming from your lips its coming from the whole body and you need to think about that when youre trying to change aspects of it
4267438 the best way to describe it is having a word on the tip of the tongue that you just cant find its very frightening and frustrating to come to after a stroke and realise that you cant tell the doctor and those around you how youre feeling
4267439 to our ears they sound as if theyre not a native speaker of english
4267440 it occurs all over the world and the consensus is that it has a lot less to do with them developing a new accent and much more to do with us labelling what we hear interestingly if i play a tape of an english person with the syndrome to someone who is not a native english speaker they dont hear someone with an accent they hear someone with a speech impediment
4267441 it would be great that my ability to do ridiculous voices didnt end up a silly thing i did at parties but actually helped someone with speech difficulties
4267442 by using we have succeeded in showing that brain regions mediating language processes participate in neural networks activated by perceptual decision
4267443 these findings represent a major break through on this research topic by providing neuro physiological evidence in support of the whorfian hypothesis
4267444 this work also serves as a demonstration of a new method for the study of the age old question of how peoples experience might be shaped by their language
4267445 advertising network operators such as google have evolved beyond merely tracking consumer web surfing activity on sites for which they have a direct ad serving relationship they now have the ability to observe a users entire web browsing experience at a granular level

4267449 why nature doesnt use prime numbers but the numbers are intrinsic to the mathematical system just as certain structures are intrinsic to language
4267450 until dti was developed scientists lacked non invasive methods to study brain connectivity directly
4267451 the vocal learning system is embedded within an ancient pathway
4267452 offers unexpected insights on the origins of spoken language and could open up new approaches to understanding vocalization disorders in humans
4267453 points us more firmly in a direction that vocal learning ability is functioning in a specialized motor system it doesnt conclusively solve it but it strongly suggests it
4267454 the cautionary note is of course that the proximity of motor areas to song control regions per se does not prove anything
4267455 i think this is a compelling hypothesis that is gaining ground from studies across different species and diverse approaches
4267456 the implications of phonetic symbolism for brand names are relatively straightforward
4267457 if sounds do convey certain types of meaning then perceptions of brands may be enhanced when the fit between the sound symbolism and the product attributes is maximized
4267458 most of what we know about species and ecosystems is not written down anywhere its only in peoples heads
4267459 mathematical analysis of this linguistic evolution reveals that irregular verb conjugations behave in an extremely regular way one that can yield predictions and insights into the future stages of a verbs evolutionary trajectory
4267460 we measured something no one really thought could be measured and got a striking and beautiful result
4267461 were really on the front lines of developing the mathematical tools to study evolutionary dynamics
4267462 before language was considered too messy and difficult a system for mathematical study but now were able to successfully quantify an aspect of how language changes and develops
4267463 now may be your last chance to be a newly wed
4267464 the married couples of the future can only hope for wedded bliss
4267465 irregular verbs are fossils that reveal how linguistic rules and perhaps social rules are born and die
4267466 the data hasnt changed but suddenly youre able to make powerful predictions about the future
4267467 the results demonstrate that at 18 months children have a rudimentary understanding of the sound system of their language and that knowledge guides their interpretation of the sounds they encounter
4267468 children can easily hear how the same word can be pronounced in different ways
4267469 the brain lit up with activity when proper names were used including areas that are not associated with language
4267470 we saw considerable activity in areas of the parietal lobe that involve spatial processing that was absent when pronouns were used
4267471 we are at the mercy of our memory system which is limited
4267472 the more items or representations we hold the more effort we need to spend so as not to lose information pronouns let us avoid that juggle in our brains i expected to find activity in classic language areas of the brain i was surprised to see activity in the spatial areas but it makes perfect sense
4267473 language has evolved to meet our brains needs and sign language is no different
4267474 in fact although sign languages are often studied through comparison to spoken languages in this case sign language may show the internal working of the brains language ability more transparently than any spoken language
4267475 our study suggests that just like signers english speakers place people that were previously mentioned in space although in the case of english speakers this space is a virtual brain space
4267476 these results also provide support for the notion that vocal emotional communication manifests itself in similar ways across disparate cultures
4267477 the field of developmental psychology and language development has always assumed that something happens at that point to account for this word spurt kids discover things have names they switch to using more efficient mechanisms and they use their first words to help discover new ones
4267478 children are going to get that word spurt guaranteed mathematically as long as a couple of conditions hold
4267479 they have to be learning more than one word at a time and they must be learning a greater number of difficult or moderate words than easy words using computer simulations and mathematical analysis i found that if those two conditions are true you always get a vocabulary explosion
4267480 if we see the same word spurt when we model the inverse of accepted thinking then clearly the specialized mechanisms arent necessary
4267481 our general abilities can take us a lot farther than we thought
4267482 the debate in language acquisition is around how much specific information about language is hard wired into the brain of the infant and how much is something that can be explained by relatively general purpose learning systems
4267483 the problem the child confronts is how many categories of sounds are there and how should i think about it were trying to propose a method that solves that problem
4267484 it learns how many sounds there are it figures that out
4267485 in the past people have tried to argue it wasnt possible for any machine to learn these things and so it had to be hard wired in humans
4267486 those arguments in my view were not particularly well grounded
4267487 nelson style schneiers second post backs this up and returns us to the point whilst we paint terrorists as idiots by misusing the term there are always those wholl make the label stick by actually

4267503 crps totals based on employer are limited to donors contributing more than 200 since information is not provided to the federal election commission for smaller contributions so these figures are likely to disproportionately represent the mood of officers who have more disposable income to spend on politics than do the lower ranks but because young people tend to be more liberal than their elders the total dollar figures could lean even more in obamas favor
4267504 the fifth story in the alliance series cosmic scandal tells of a man and woman in a cosmic snarl author lyndi lamont writes with such passion that i wanted to crawl into myreks arms when he didnt allow sweet khira to lose her virginity but instead found other ways to feel close i had to keep an ice cold drink handy i highly recommend short story alliance cosmic scandal to my friends who enjoy romantica
4267505 cosmic scandal is another delightful episode in the alliance series for the first time myrek desires to follow his heart rather than his duty but khira knows their love is doomed lyndi lamont continues this fabulous saga of two planets struggle to come together with myrek older brother to rulik who was introduced in the first book diplomatic relations this is a very enjoyable series i look forward to the next installment
4267506 people started having imagination at this time much more than they had earlier
4267507 languages that have been separated 8 000 years get down to a low percentage of common words however that low percentage seems to be very stable
4267508 youve presented this list of words but it looks like you can explain these lists in several different ways
4267509 their data is really easy to challenge and its really easy to find words that are similar to one another across languages
4267510 it is more risky because youre comparing two or more hypotheticals to arrive at an even more hypothetical construction

4267512 fondare dal basso un percorso politico programmatico da portare avanti senza cedimenti
4267513 unoccasione unica e irripetibile che ci viene offerta dalla storia ha dichiarato marco tulli dei verdi per costruire in italia come ad arezzo un soggetto politico unitario e aperto che lavori a una rivoluzione delle idee e definisca un orizzonte nuovo a cui faccia seguito una prassi concreta caratterizzata da assenza di tatticismi e giochi di cordata non sfruttare le attuali condizioni storiche per inseguire questo obiettivo significherebbe abbandonare ogni prospettiva noi non vogliamo perdere lopportunit e in tempi brevi vogliamo arrivare anche alla creazione di un gruppo unico in consiglio comunale
4267514 con la partenza di questo percorso ha proseguito francesco romizi del pdci la sinistra non intende contraddistinguersi come la forza politica del no ma costruire proposte attorno alle problematiche principali che coinvolgono la nostra realt contiamo molto sulla partecipazione per dare rilievo a questa due giorni programmatiche che in fondo la prima grande iniziativa della campagna elettorale durante la quale i partiti della sinistra arcobaleno marceranno assieme tra i temi che vogliamo sottolineare c quello del lavoro la nostra realt sta soffrendo ci sono tensioni nelle fabbriche come abbiamo rilevato durante lultimo volantinaggio alla uno a erre voglio dire con chiarezza che ci schiereremo sempre a difesa dei diritti acquisiti dei lavoratori e ci impegneremo affinch siano estesi a chi invece oggi si trova in una condizione di precariato
4267515 nei venti mesi di governo prodi ha concluso marco paolucci di rifondazione comunista non abbiamo nascosto differenze programmatiche ma mostrato al contempo lealt la caduta dellesecutivo a livello nazionale e la scelta del partito democratico di correre da solo alla elezioni rischiano invece di creare contraccolpi anche a livello locale non siamo dei meri portatori dacqua disponibili a mediare sempre e comunque sui nostri valori e istanze per poi vederci scaricati magari a causa delliniziativa di forze centriste inceneritore acqua pubblica urbanistica cultura sono argomenti nei quali a livello locale non si marcia nella direzione che condividiamo li affronteremo durante la due giorni programmatica le risultanze dei nostri stati generali dovranno avere ricadute territoriali difenderemo la piattaforma politica che ne scaturir fino in fondo senza cedimenti e alzando semmai il tiro del confronto

4267543 its vital that duty free carts are taken out into the economy cabin with the cigarettes displayed prominently on top
4267544 you cant use the gotorecord action or method on an object in design view
4267545 i would not have made it this far without their help
4267546 all our artists are professionals who excel in all styles of tattooing from custom pieces traditional tribal japanese and portraits
4267547 its been devastating i never thought this would happen for one thing and not from a public sector job
4267548 this is about the right of everybody to be treated equally with respect
4267549 public employees cannot be terminated merely because her employers dont approve of who she is
4267550 it has to be done someone has to do it
4267551 nothing will be totally right until we achieve legal civil marriage but weve taken a huge giant step
4267552 the certificate is a symbol its a tangible symbol of what really has happened
4267553 im amazed at how quickly its been accepted and our relationships are being accepted and moving into the mainstream of society
4267554 its proved the sky is not falling that marriages arent threatened
4267555 we are trying to give ourselves as much legal protection as possible
4267556 we had to go through a more rigorous process than we would have if we were married
4267557 if you cannot say anything nice do not say anything at all
4267558 you ether die a hero or live long enough to become a villian
4267559 in what looked like a desperately needed respite from all the bad detective work and self aggrandizing media punditry a gay reporter was on hand during cnns larry king live
4267560 for me as a gay man who is still closeted it was the first time i have ever been around other gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people
4267561 it was the first time that i was truly myself and the very first time that i felt safe
4267562 the whole idea behind the camp was to bring young adult leaders for social justice skills building and to work on their personal development as leaders and looking at their own identity understanding their ethics and values as leaders and kind of creating a moral compass as a leader that will benefit them throughout their lives
4267563 its self selection meaning they apply to go to camp
4267564 but because they have to pay for it often times the money comes from their college campus so depending on whether their college can pay for their registration a lot of applicants are selected before we get their registration
4267565 one of our directors came up to me and he said hey you know what
4267566 fortunately the director of my office the one i work for did have a budget to send undergraduate students for development skills
4267567 so they were able to pay for my registration and my flight
4267568 i never knew that there were lots of lgbt issues and a lot of activism going on it was the very first time i was exposed to it
4267569 its just not about what they learned but its about the lifelong friendships that they create
4267570 and you know camp can create connections like no other program can because people are forced to be with one another and it kind of creates that family bond and for an lgbt or ally student that familiar bond is important to them
4267571 its sad to say but i really didnt have a so called gay friend all my friends have happened to be straight and i left that camp with lifelong friends who i talk to at least once a week through facebook or text
4267572 we do that through what we call a crystal ball leadership activity where campers create their own crystal ball and how they want their campus to look in five or 10 years from now
4267573 and in their crystal ball they come up with projects that will get them to the point where campus is seen as more lgbt friendly
4267574 i feel like you know my campus is somewhat conservative and i dont see a lot of gay and lesbian outreach programs
4267575 i dont see as much organizations and what im thinking is that im going to take what i have learned from this camp and see what i can do to have a stronger lgbt community on campus
4267576 every day were not out here someone is getting hiv
4267577 decrease hiv transmission and do not increase the use of illegal drugs
4267578 no one says to themselves theyre giving away syringes lets go get some heroin
4267579 youre first the addict and you do it whether you have a clean syringe or not
4267580 when it comes to the distribution of needles we know that it carries an enablement of continued drug use
4267581 and we fear the evidence is strong that it does not succeed in its effort to control the contagion
4267582 to me it seems quite shortsighted that our state lags so far behind in this important concept of preventing such diseases
4267583 we are curious as to why mr caster saw fit to contribute so much money to this campaign of fear and hate to find out we are asking our millions of friends and supporters all over the united states to help us by calling terry caster and asking him why he and his family are so strongly against marriage equality
4267584 mr caster and many of his eight sons and daughters and their spouses have given a combined total of 293 000 to the protect marriage campaign between january and july of 2008 so effective today we are asking our millions of friends and supporters all over the united states to help us by calling terry caster and asking him why he and his family are so strongly against marriage equality
4267585 when economic times gets tighter hate crime violence goes up
4267586 we hope that the many gays and lesbians who usually attend eurovision finals from different countries will join our pride
4267587 can be described in no other way than as satanic
4267588 the force will not tolerate any form of homophobic behavior
4267589 miss ladeles dignity and created an intimidating hostile degrading humiliating or offensive environment
4267590 the authorities have not yet announced why the brothers were detained or whether or not they intend to bring any charges against them
4267591 moreover they have refused to disclose information about where the alaei brothers are being held and have not provided them access to counsel
4267592 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
4267593 i clearly intended to say that child abuse was worse even than homosexuality and sodomy
4267594 he is not violent i have not seen him hit anybody in my life
4267595 steven hirschfield had everything to live for so this myth that you are hearing that steven was attacking a police officer is completely at odds with the type of person that steven hirschfield was
4267596 the manner in which this police officer handled this situation is consistent with somebody who might hold some preconceived notions against gay people
4267597 received no new information to render our initial report inaccurate we are standing by that now but it was preliminary
4267598 i knew steve he was my sisters boyfriend he was probably freaked out by the guys hitting on him and wanted off that boat
4267599 i happen to be his cousin and this whole thing doesnt sound credible
4267600 i knew steve he was my sisters boyfriend he was probably freaked out by the guys hitting on him and wanted off that boat
4267601 oh mr gay stripper thank god youre fine and was just joking i think thats great so funny unfortunately youve broken the law and we will be arresting you now please come on the boat i have a blanket to keep you warm until we get to shore well make you some hot chocolate too thank you for understanding that we must arrest you im sorry that little stunt will cost you so much in legal fees now please come on board so i can dry off and go back to my post to sleep
4267602 driving at 3 5 mph for more than a mile
4267603 you cant please all of the people all of the time
4267604 misogynistic mean spirited divisive out of touch fact twisting women hating men
4267605 my position is its not the reason why im running for president of the united states and i think that two parent families are best for america because i think well i think that its it is important for us to emphasize family values but i think its very important that we understand that we have other challenges too im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family
4267606 my own death threats have declined considerably i think ive become rather boring now to the public at large on this particular issue gay so im thought to be unremarkable
4267607 i had designers throwing clothes at me and then you realize you have to go to the fashion shows
4267608 i think pride is less politicized sometimes than it used to be and thats probably a good sign because i think its truly a celebration it was before as well but in older prides there was a little more of a political slant there was a lot of activism to be done and there still is but i think because we made a lot of headway were able to relax a bit
4267609 it was a huge relief and it took me about a year to admit to myself that id done it deliberately the truth is cruising has gone on for as long as there have been men trying to hide their sexuality
4267610 i just think john edwards is an incredibly creepy individual and the very definition of faggy
4267611 once again ann coulter has made a cynical and desperate bid for attention by using a vulgar dehumanizing anti gay slur more and more fair minded americans believe that theres no place for this kind of bigotry and coulters shrinking media platform only confirms how out of step she is with the rest of the country glaad urges the media to shine a spotlight on ann coulters history of using anti gay slurs and the media outlets that support this language by continuing to provide her with a platform
4267612 i grew up at a time when there were no role models to be gay or lesbian was to be a failure oh i shared the fact that i was attracted to men within two weeks of meeting my ex wife isabella all of my real romantic relations previous to her had been with men i felt ready for a relationship with her but i was still unsure about marriage isabella assured me wed deal with it together and we did 13 years later
4267613 we made a commitment and we understood the controversy but we are now aware the labor council had voted for an official boycott
4267614 and as we have an open dialogue about the best way to move forward let us never forget that we are still a community of brothers and sisters standing as one to advance equality for all glbt people
4267615 our theme this year was activate celebrate demonstrate elevate and thats what we were trying to do activate the crowd celebrate diversity demonstrate that dykes are visible and present in san diego and elevate everyones spirits with a great day of programming
4267616 kristi shaw from the center hosted a marriage equality workshop artist gina grossini was printing no on 8 t shirts and bags on site and volunteers from the center were registering people to vote and signing up marriage advocacy volunteers
4267617 a few of the community organizations san diego democratic club stonewall citizens patrol the bike kitchen etc that had tables at the festival had male members present but the crowd marchers were mostly female
4267618 however a few of our trans brothers really helped us out with set up break down and other volunteer tasks
4267619 i think the change in the timing for dyke march has had an impact on attendance for sure because it hasnt been the same from one year to the next
4267620 in san francisco dyke march is always the saturday before pride everybody knows that no one has to look at their calendar the san diego march has to be established as such instead of toggling back and forth
4267621 i also think that it is extremely important that the dyke community and the people who support the dyke community come out to support dyke march i heard so many people say we dont go to dyke march because pride is bigger dyke march is about radically speaking out for our rights as to who we are and in order to do that it takes solidarity in the community and women in san diego need to have more of that
4267622 there was a little bit of confusion at this years march
4267623 but that was due largely in part to the police dyke march is not a permitted march and so the police were there supposedly to let us safely go through the street in the end it seemed like they just made everything much more difficult and destroyed the flow of what was planned which is why they dykes on bikes didnt really lead this years march
4267624 san diego dyke march is continuing to grow and so while its still a small dyke march compared to marches that take place in the larger cities in the rest of the country its continuing to grow and thats a positive direction
4267625 the festival was fun and celebratory and joyous it had this good day out kind of a feel
4267626 i believe that we must hold ourselves to an even higher ethical standard
4267627 eu estava h dois anos fora do brasil e voc fica fora da m dia o n utico abriu as portas para mim e n o quero ser injusto com o contrato renovado acredito que as duas partes v o sair ganhando no futuro
4267628 130 ve culos armados russos abandonou zugdidi e est se dirigindo para kutaisi
4267629 no terreno as coisas v o melhor mas preciso consolidar a paz
4267630 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
4267631 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
4267632 the organizations parliament will make the system more of a democratic monarchy and will give each respective court a voice within the organization
4267633 each chapter of the international court system elected a representative and an alternate to parliament
4267634 our most significant accomplishments in the past several years has been the ability for all the chapters of the international imperial court system to communicate with each other via the internet
4267635 the queen mothers establishment of parliament is the first step to making sure that the entire court system has a voice in the organization
4267636 from the perception of the members of parliament it will give the court a better understanding of how the entire court system is operating it will also allow members of the icc to hear the concerns from the majority of the kingdoms
4267637 we are excited to be the host to the representatives from throughout the united states canada and mexico and also to have the honor of judy shepard to be our guest at the annual coronation ball
4267638 why give her to somebody else to use she hasnt begun to use herself
4267639 hyatt put so much money into advertising this hotel in gay magazines and its a huge slap in the face
4267640 its a personal decision of mr manchesters that doesnt involve hyatt
4267641 his name is on the door but its not the views of hyatt
4267642 hyatt is involved with someone who is giving a lot of money to a campaign to take away our rights
4267643 we dont hate anyone who has a same sex attraction but we cant let them redefine marriage for the rest of us
4267644 people should be able to stand up and contribute for the common sense idea of marriage
4267645 you can be the most intelligent well read human being but when it comes to matters of the heart or the loins we all become idiots
4267646 i thought innocent until proven guilty also applied in u s law it seems sad when as everybody who has had a drug problem knows it takes supreme effort to get where i am today i was really looking forward to doing my first live tour for a decade and to be told that after all this hard work i am not welcome in the u s for even six short weeks is heartbreaking
4267647 from the beginning my whole scene broke out in the gay clubs i have to give credit where credit is due
4267648 ive got so much to give a barry white song works well in every room of the house
4267649 the only thing republicans really have going for them this year is fear fear of terrorists coming over the ocean and fear of immigrants coming over the border and fear of homosexuals coming over your back
4267650 is it not fascinating in this day and age that our most powerful capitalist companies those most associated with mainstream dumbed down unhealthy rather uninformed republican americana even these megacorps are now openly and rather shamelessly supporting gay rights and tolerance
4267651 san diego is united in its outrage at the manchesters funding of the initiative to outlaw marriage equality i believe that all fair minded san diegans should take a stand against discrimination and boycott the manchester hyatt
4267652 the anti gays need to be kept in secure areas at the pride parade by allowing them to walk free this year they provoked some gays and that resulted in arrests by the police tell me this would a white man carrying a noose be allowed to march along the sidelines of the black bud billiken parade for their own protection and out of respect for the parade the anti gays with huge and hateful signs should have their area to protest surrounded by police this really could have escalated in violence and death
4267653 there was a rallying cry among the commenters to spam bomb her and her employers
4267654 if shes looking to find whos responsible for her plight she ought to start by looking in the mirror
4267655 a post is clearly different than sending an e mail
4267656 for any harm the unauthorized and inappropriate e mail may have caused
4267657 the soul of san diego keeping balboa park magnificent in its second century
4267658 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
4267659 theres no reason except for the sake of red meat for his base to throw up screens in the way of children in foster care getting homes
4267660 sen mccain would deny loving homes to children who desperately need them simply because of an outdated prejudice about what a family may look like
4267661 john mccain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue he was not endorsing any federal legislation
4267662 sen mccains expressed his personal preference for children to be raised by a mother and a father wherever possible
4267663 however as an adoptive father himself mccain believes children deserve loving and caring home environments and he recognizes that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes john mccain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative
4267664 it is an insult to these professionals and the children whom they represent to suggest that the door should be closed to people other than a traditional married couple
4267665 his implication is that every adopted child should have a mother and father
4267666 that may be the ideal but if we stick to it we would have far fewer homes for kids single people gay and straight represent a significant number of adoptive parents
4267667 if sen mccain came and sat down with us id tell him weve proven that both parents are important in our family
4267668 unless something dramatic happens when the bill is considered we should be able to get this accepted
4267669 its a commitment that i dont think weve seen around here for a while to improve the quality of life on reservations
4267670 while i applaud u s leadership when it comes to combating hiv aids overseas my amendment seeks to ensure we dont turn our backs on some of the most critical issues here at home
4267671 its what so many other restaurants are trying to make
4267672 thats quite a statement manchester is making with his checkbook in opposition to equal rights for all californians
4267673 manchester is using that money to turn around and discriminate against our members and is using members money to deny rights to other people
4267674 im opposed to using members money or investment managers money used to underwrite this function somewhere that seeks to disenfranchise our members
4267675 holding your conference at the manchester grand hyatt hotel means that many county employees who pay into the pension system and are also union members would be forced to cross the picket line if they wish to attend
4267676 for county workers like myself who are members of the lgbt community attending this conference would no longer be an option since it is being held at a hotel whose owner has donated to a ballot initiative that threatens the rights of my community
4267677 as a member of the lgbt community i feel precluded from attending the conference
4267678 the money i contribute to the pension should not be used to support an anti gay anti union establishment like the manchester grand hyatt
4267679 theres no evidence of discriminatory practices at this hotel and this individual as anyone does has the right to their opinions and their views
4267680 our goal is to get about 100 bars and restaurants on board
4267681 i gotta hope my heart has a fate thats gonna jump out at me
4267682 for every man there are two women the one youre with and the one you could be with possibility but you must pick one
4267683 if you could dance with the days of your life if you could take life by the wrist and dance i think it would be a waltz forward and back sad and happy high and low
4267684 targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
4267685 id bring my clothes and sell them if you did it
4267686 this in depth look at southern californias fashion industry is absolutely unprecedented
4267687 a seamless display of a fashion culture that knows no borders will mesmerize san diego this fall
4267688 im all about quality and reminding the world what makes a woman a woman
4267689 some people say i dress too gay but every day i feel so gay and when im gay i dress that way something wrong with that
4267690 high jacked from the gay black and latino underground scene
4267691 a gloriously burnished fusion of 3 decades of classic dance music
4267692 a ctors are basically drag queens people will tell you they act because they want to heal mankind or you know explore the nature of the human psyche yes maybe but basically we just want to put on a frock and dance
4267693 no way that cruise would be returning to the role
4267694 which given his current career trajectory is much more plausible
4267695 attorney general michael mukasey should use the doj debacle and knoxville shooting to voice his support for congressional bils that republicans have opposed because they havent seen proof that gays and lesbians suffer from job discrimination or hate crimes
4267696 cost me 1 600 bucks i got a fine of 50 and had to pay court costs and attorney fees
4267697 i dont understand how she got past them troopers the first time
4267698 the troopers were just doing their job evidently that was the first time it had ever happened and they did not know what to do or how to do it
4267699 the highway patrol troopers were very nice most of them knew me but i sure wish they had said just take it back to your vehicle
4267700 it was very humiliating no one in my family had ever been arrested my grandpa took pride in that and i was shamed
4267701 unfortunately for him he davis was the first one but i doubt there was a plan that we were going to take the first person to jail
4267702 were willing to admit that a breach of security did occur and she did self report the incident
4267703 but as far as what occurred we feel like it is better for future security not to discuss the details
4267704 it was an honest mistake from being out of my routine you know
4267705 two harbor police boats and a u s coast guard patrol vessel responded to a report of a man overboard in the bay shortly after 11 p m on saturday
4267706 the rescue vessel located the man in the bay about 500 feet south of the u s coast guard air station on north harbor drive at first he refused to climb aboard the vessel but once he was aboard he began to attack officers
4267707 it was quite upsetting to learn about what really happened when i saw the news the next day
4267708 there was rumor that someone had either jumped or fallen overboard but i think most people thought it was a joke until we docked and were told that police would be interviewing everyone before they exited the boat most people cooperated but a few were angry
4267709 on behalf of and for all of attendees sic saturday night we are saddened by the evenings turn of events
4267710 we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of steven hirschfield
4267711 this was a person who breaks up fights not one who starts them
4267712 hirschfield was a gentle and loving person who took care of himself and worked out everyday there are too many inconsistencies in the story
4267713 it was clear that there was something wrong with the situation and hed obviously wanted to go overboard because he didnt want to be helped
4267714 logically if it was accidental hed want out of the water
4267715 i knew steve he was my sisters boyfriend he was probably freaked out by the guys hitting on him and wanted off that boat
4267716 i happen to be his cousin and this whole thing doesnt sound credible
4267717 dykes on bikes is the attention grabber they bring people out of the shops and back to their seats they are the official signal in every city that pride has arrived
4267718 what do you mean the dykes on bikes are fourth this year
4267719 the parade doesnt start unless the dykes start it out
4267720 phew there they are now the parade has actually begun
4267721 the somber point of the marchers for those who cant could have just as well been made after the bikes
4267722 i was very disappointed that the parade didnt start with the infamous roar and thunder of dykes on bikes the girls are the main reason i go to the parade and they are the thing that many of us leave talking about
4267723 along with dozens of other angry pride visitors i was horrified at the atrocious sound system and lack of any logistical organization at the kathy griffin concert on the sunday night of pride
4267724 should the pride board include affected contingents in the decision making process when making fundamental changes regarding the parade
4267725 i dont know what to tell you i have many homosexual friends who still complain that they are discriminated against that they lack opportunities there are no queers in the party and those are signs that they are still alienated to the best of our knowledge none of the rulers have come out of the closet yet
4267726 what i dont understand is how everything stays the same
4267727 the government said a year ago that many things were going to change but we stayed the same and the people are very desperate ra l castro still has not had an opportunity to demonstrate what he thinks because his brother fidel is there and still emits his opinions owning a mobile telephone and being allowed to enter a tourist hotel is not reform when it comes to freedoms were going backward
4267728 discrimination against those in the army who are lesbian gay and bisexual does not give them a chance to contribute or to play a full part in the teams that are vital for our success on operations
4267729 it is our absolute duty to treat our fellow soldiers as we would wish to be treated ourselves
4267730 documented brutal floggings imposed by courts as punishment and torture and ill treatment including sexual abuse in police custody
4267731 we applied to the prefecture with the identical notification to the ones we used in the last two years adding one word before we said that we were protesting against executions of minors and this time we said that we will protest against executions of minors and homosexuals
4267732 this is just another example that moscow authorities actually banned all public events of sexual minorities in the city depriving this social group of their constitutional right which is guaranteed by article 31 of the constitution
4267733 while members of the association are as men and women subject to article 10 of the constitution which states that all persons are equal before the law since there are no constitutional regulations regarding any other gender identity besides man and woman forming an association based solely on sexual orientation and gender identity is against the essence and the spirit of this article and the concept of equality aimed by it
4267734 it is observed that encouragement and propaganda in all levels of the society of the sexual orientation of the members of the association through organizing instructive programs are predominant in the associations aims and that these activities are likely to bring about a tyranny of a minority over the majority which is against legal and constitutional regulations and that this would jeopardize the rights and freedom of the family and children as mentioned in article 41 of the constitution and the rights and the freedom of the youth as mentioned in article 58 of the constitution
4267735 no association may be founded for unlawful or immoral purposes
4267736 if we hold on together wolfe is a hoot in
4267737 rising infection rates coupled with inadequate funding resources and infrastructure have resulted in a catastrophic situation in our public health care systems in the south
4267738 the ruralness of the epidemic is whats becoming painfully clear
4267739 certainly one of the big misconceptions is it is big cities on the west coast and east coast that are really driving the disease and its not so
4267740 its moved both in terms of geography and demography its really important for people in southern states to know that because theyre not getting their fair share of support
4267741 were driving the epidemic but were still getting the least money
4267742 for nicole to seek immunity from critics concerning his health friends and organizations must be the height of arrogance
4267743 if ron de harte wants to make statements then he needs to step down and form his own group
4267744 perhaps the best that could happen would be for the same sex activists to lose this one until they can properly fix the problem
4267745 theyre not choosing to push same sex marriage through legislation in alabama
4267746 its become clear to most americans that there is no real good argument against allowing gays to marry
4267747 they can see with their own eyes that the gays didnt use up all the marriage licenses
4267748 its a strategic and tactical mismatch to have their best national people going up against our best state people
4267749 maintain respect for the sexual preferences of each person without the existence of any type of discrimination
4267750 jesus of nazareth never preached hatred homophobia or segregation instead he knew to say love one another
4267751 it is false that the draft is recognizing as family the union of homosexuals what we are doing is recognizing the dignity of all people without discrimination based on race sex sexual orientation etc
4267752 lets hope now that theres been so much talk about moral incompatibilities between the new constitution and the gospel sometimes utilizing falsehoods that we also can talk with equal force about the profound incompatibility of the social situation of that inequality of that existing social injustice with the gospels
4267753 we encourage people to dare to be themselves and live the way they want
4267754 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
4267755 this is our city at its most diverse and this is one of the most creative communities we have in belfast
4267756 statistically it is not plausible that none of them are gay sadly the fact that none has come out signals that they feel the fire brigade environment is not accommodating to gays and we have to change that
4267757 i will and have already almost brought it to that pass that the king shall not be able to whip a cat but i must be at the tayle of it
4267758 the king shall not be able to whip a cat but i must be at the tayle of it
4267759 i am very confident that on august 22 we will submit more than enough signatures to place the arkansas adoption and foster care act on the ballot
4267760 we always suspected they would be short and were going to work very hard in the next 30 days to educate arkansans about what this initiated act really does and encourage them not to sign

4267770 open hearts with cardiovascular issues open minds between 2 p m and 3 p m open doors with a bouncer lurking behind them
4267771 im tired of being part of a church that lacks integrity
4267772 i love my church and i dont want to leave it but i cant be part of a church that is willing to portray a god that is so hateful i would rather be forced out
4267773 they want to do something they want something special they dont want something stale
4267774 for us the main thing is that people have a great experience when they come to richs
4267775 having a great time involves music entertainment performers and devising really great theme nights so people feel they get their moneys worth creating the most fun nights the best entertainment and the best music ultimately is what is going to draw people in
4267776 universal prides itself on keeping the level of service consistently high and knowing how to execute when it comes to offering a product so every time you come back you have a good experience
4267777 were going to be providing that extra level of service that others may or may not be providing and if they are were two steps ahead of them upping the ante with something else up our sleeve to roll out
4267778 weve seen a huge increase in business were up 40 percent from last year and weve started so many new nights
4267779 compared to downtown the gaslamp los angeles hillcrest was a bit behind the times but people are starting to catch on starting to realize the benefits of vip service and bottle service in particular
4267780 from two standpoints from a customers standpoint its the best way to go no hassles and from a business standpoint businesses are realizing the potential for generating revenue and building a base of repeat loyal customers
4267781 there is a market of people who want the vip treatment and who are willing to pay a bit more for the extra level of service for their own reserved space
4267782 l l bear was at richs before i owned richs
4267783 the concept was to have a night that catered to a crowd that in the past hadnt been catered to there may be bars that cater to a slightly older more mature crowd but not a nightclub or a dance club those usually cater to a 21 30 year old crowd who go out a few times a week what you see with the bear crowd is a crowd that goes out a few times a month and they want a night that is their own and we host theme parties and bring in guest djs to go along with the night and cater to the crowd giving them a night that is their own
4267784 the crowd the bear crowd is typically a little older more financially stable with stable careers and they spend quite a bit of money
4267785 bars are catching on this is the crowd to target the dont create any problems no fighting theyre very easygoing patient and polite and they spend money its one of the best crowds to have in a club
4267786 that he is getting closer to deciding to run for governor in 2010
4267787 this is one of the most pernicious statutes on our books
4267788 in some respects this bill puts the final nail in the coffin of those dark days
4267789 the massachusetts senate has no right to infringe on the internal issues of how other states define marriage but thats exactly what they voted today to do
4267790 es tan extra o que nos hayamos encontrado y que nos hayamos enamorado soy tan feliz de haberme cruzado con dale
4267791 notice how i said i know ayyyy found this 17 hours ago on
4267792 if they are nagging and annoying youre like go away
4267793 im striving to be an example of normalcy because im noticed as an actor people are aware of whats happening in my life im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that then you can look around and say i really deeply feel like im in love with this person there are people who feel the same thing and those models are normal the normal couples were sort of in the shadows for the past 15 or 20 years because you sort of needed other people to come forward and speak out
4267794 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue with the paparazzi
4267795 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
4267796 i dont have much patience particularly for people in my party the democratic party that are arguing for separate institutions such as civil unions for gay people as somehow equal thats not audacity thats not authenticity thats not about conviction thats about accommodation and political posturing and im done with that
4267797 the fundamental right to marry part of the holding in the california marriage case was extremely significant but the courts holding that sexual orientation is a suspect classification was stunning completely unprecedented i think it will forever change the legal landscape for lgbt people in the country its going to have a huge impact on courts in other states and ultimately on the federal courts we are now living in a different legal world because of what the court did
4267798 we are proud to join no on 8 and equality california to protect the freedom to marry for all californians for years pg amp e has advocated for equality and fairness in the workplace and across california in that same spirit pg amp e is honored to be a founding member of the equality business advisory council and urge our business colleagues to join us as we work to guarantee the same rights and freedoms for every californian
4267799 weve ridded our state laws of the last vestige of discrimination against same sex couples and we once again lead the way for equality for all people
4267800 i thought it was really really beautiful and very healing
4267801 it brought tears to my eyes thinking that i am legally entitled to marry this wonderful couple but i am not entitled to have the same joy in my own life
4267802 gay friends rang to tell me about it they were horrified and really annoyed
4267803 we all felt it was so wrong to grab all the benefits that marriage gives you and just make a little statement to calm your guilt
4267804 it was that partnership that showed ducky how it is possible to survive stresses and strains of having two people fit together if she didnt have that example i dont think we would be marrying today
4267805 we went to great pains to ensure that our vows were gender neutral because we wanted to get married in a way that anyone could follow
4267806 with gods assistance to be onto you always a loving and faithful partner
4267807 ultimately im happy for anyone who finds the right person
4267808 i totally understand that but my own wedding just made me more determined to get those rights extended to everyone
4267809 cannot be required to finance a lifestyle that neither he nor matos supported even during the marriage
4267810 was a reflection and an extension of mcgreeveys temporary elected status as governor
4267811 motives are clearly a bad faith attempt to frustrate the support that the defendant seeks for herself and for jacqueline his actions and conduct are a direct result of his decision to devote himself to full time studies at the general theological seminary since september 2007
4267812 anything less would be a windfall to him and would encourage him to never earn an income in accordance with his earning capacity
4267813 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
4267814 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong
4267815 not all lifestyles are equal not all religions are equal
4267816 was i saying all people are not equal heavens no we were all created equal
4267817 the biggest threat our nation has even more so than terrorism or islam
4267818 equally with no discrimination as to race religion gender or sexual preference

4267831 we think it is the correct decision under the circumstances and we think there is even more evidence than they discussed that will support their decision
4267832 the church asked for the same courtesy as it hires a new director of family services a position crucial to this conversation
4267833 the issues surrounding same gender attraction deserve careful attention not public posturing it appears from affirmations actions today that it has opted for a public rather than a private exchange
4267834 with this funding we will support treatment for at least 3 million people
4267835 while at mesa we put the welfare of student athletes first we coached outstanding student athletes to success on the courts and in the classrooms
4267836 we should have been able to advocate for equal treatment of women athletes and faculty without retaliation instead mesa fired us both for raising issues of unequal treatment and title ix violations
4267837 coach sulpizio and coach bass should have been able to continue coaching and running an excellent college basketball program at mesa
4267838 by firing these two coaches mesa is depriving their student athletes of dedicated coaches who serve as outstanding role models in a sports world with fewer and fewer female coaches
4267839 antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of republicans

4267849 i am completely taken aback by the article that was written about my sisters in san diego how soon we forget the discrimination that we as gay women have endured
4267850 the fact theyre allowed to celebrate their sexuality in our citys largest civic event each year is something to be proud of instead the members of dykes on bikes should be ashamed of their behavior
4267851 if the dykes on bikes work with pride constructively i believe they will find a way to participate that does not require them to lead the parade
4267852 people need to realize that the parade is supposed to be a celebration of our pride in who we are not a popularity contest it is supposed to reflect the unity of our community not highlight divisions
4267853 i welcome a change in leading the parade each year because
4267854 the dykes on bikes grab my attention and get me cheering and shouting later when i am hooked i stand and cry with happiness as pflag and the veterans march by
4267855 leave tradition alone the dykes on bikes are a hugely popular group and virtually everyone around me was baffled as to what was going on
4267856 tradition is important and awareness is around all the time but tradition happens only once a year
4267857 please return the sd dykes on bikes to the head of the pride parade

4267860 mike hummer had been a private detective so long he could remember preparation a his hair reminded everyone of a rat whod bitten into an electrical cord but he could still run faster than greased owl snot when he was on a bad guys trail and they said his friskings were a lot like getting a vasectomy at sears
4267861 the hardened detective glanced at his rookie partner and mused that who ever had coined the term white as a sheet had never envisioned a bed accessorized with a set of hazelnut 500 count egyptian cotton linens from ralph lauren complimented by matching shams and a duvet cover nor the dismembered body of its current occupant

4267865 cast is slowly adjusting to the change in coasts and eric is looking no worse for wear
4267866 its more or less a story of my experiences of the last four years of being the county commissioner of district 2
4267867 i can get the kids to believe homosexuality is normal
4267868 i was taken back that in 2008 a candidate would use that type of inflammatory material and do it under the name of being a christian
4267869 ive never seen a comic book with the phrase anal sodomy in it before that was a new one for me
4267870 hes pretty much grinding every ax hes got from his days in the county commission
4267871 i do not know who the good ol boys at the courthouse are
4267872 ive really encouraged him on more than one occasion to get professional help he really needs it
4267873 its typical brent rinehart subterfuge to distract from his bad job performance and likely criminal misdeeds
4267874 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4267875 this was a frivolous lawsuit it was a desperate attempt to try to keep the voter initiative off the ballot in november
4267876 were disappointed but this ruling does not affect the campaign against prop 8 in any way
4267877 we have been focused on continuing the election and moving forward
4267878 im done im finished working on this song on this portion of the production and id like to move forward
4267879 this is the worst thing ive ever worked on in my entire life
4267880 believe me ive been there and ive done it all
4267881 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
4267882 people shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
4267883 i havent heard anything from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle she knows about my faith she just wouldnt ask
4267884 i was flattered but with my schedule there was no way i could fit it in
4267885 they dont seem to mind that im a big homo
4267886 there is someone special in my life but they dont live in this country
4267887 shes a friend of a friend of mine she has all of the qualities that are most important to me
4267888 she is in school and when she finishes well see where it goes
4267889 i think hunter parrish on weeds is the hottest guy on tv but you never mention him what up with that
4267890 we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4267891 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4267892 since 1993 the department of defense has removed approximately 12 600 service members from the military under section 654 title 10 u s code commonly known as the dont ask dont tell policy
4267893 with this policy comes the loss of service members with critical skills needed in the field right now including much needed language expertise
4267894 while the focus of the hearing is to provide a fair and balanced forum for debate i think it is only fair to share my personal belief that the current policy should be repealed
4267895 i came to this position after talking with many service members active duty reserve and retired and concluded that the open service of gay men and women need not present an operational problem many americans who happen to be gay or lesbian want to answer our nations call to service and allowing them to serve in an open and honest manner would uphold the ideals of military service
4267896 my being gay and even many of my colleagues knowing about it didnt damage unit cohesion
4267897 they still put their lives in my hands and when i was injured they risked those lives to save mine
4267898 it undermines our commitment to being a nation where we are all equal in the eyes of the law and it ties the hands of commanders who want to welcome and retain americas best and brightest into the military fold
4267899 inappropriate passive aggressive actions common in the homosexual community short of physical touching and assault
4267900 allowing homosexuality in the military would cause unnecessary sexual tension and disruptions to good order morale discipline and unit cohesion this would erode the very qualities of military service that presently appeal to potential recruits
4267901 we need a new president in order to get this passed
4267902 dont ask dont tell weakens our national security by preventing qualified men and women from serving our country
4267903 we believe that this is a good first step to have this hearing but we dont believe that this bill will come forward until we have a new president
4267904 we specialize in assisting clients to buy sell and invest in real estate
4267905 we also design estate plans to help protect clients assets and carry out their wishes
4267906 i bring a wealth of knowledge and legal acumen to each and every real estate transaction and estate plan
4267907 nothing satisfies me more than seeing the smiles that come with a successful sale or the purchase of a lifetime
4267908 when people are comfortable they eat well and drink well
4267909 whether you are remodeling building a new home or you just want more pure natural light we can help
4267910 locally there are several reasons why we have so many happy customers
4267911 solatube the daylighting company has proven to us that its way of adding natural light is much better than a skylight
4267912 members of the san diego dykes on bikes showed a galling lack of tact and sensitivity
4267913 the fact is there is no harm in straying from tradition
4267914 in our opinion there is no harm straying from tradition
4267915 it is a false assumption that most people particularly younger people of our community know about the human rights violations glbt people face worldwide
4267916 were in our sixth year of exhibiting at comic con presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before
4267917 its exciting to see how prism has grown and how diversity is accepted at comic con
4267918 well maybe we didnt have the market pegged quite as well as we thought
4267919 i think its good that the victims dont have to testify
4267920 i think so much of the progress over the year is the result of the work we did a few years back to change the face of congress to put more of our friends in charge in 2006 and to really make sure that the lgbt community was a part of making that change
4267921 as a result of the good work of sen kerry mine and others we were able to get a revision into pepfar so once the president signs the bill it will be the law and that is a very big deal for our community
4267922 you are letting us down because of your organizations approach toward enda
4267923 youre creating division within the community youre selling us out youre selling the whole transgender community short just go ahead and take the t out of the things that you support
4267924 if the bill is going to pass its going to pass with transgender inclusion
4267925 if the bill is going to fail its going to fail with transgender inclusion and i fail to believe it any other way
4267926 enda would not have gone to a house vote with protections for transgender people included in the bill
4267927 we all need a history lesson i am an african american person who has benefited from civil rights legislation why didnt african americans in 1964 include lgbt americans in their legislation because it wouldnt have passed
4267928 i have had many conversations with barack obama about his vision of this country and every conversation he has made it clear to me that he will include us
4267929 he has thought deeply and for a long time about issues impacting our community and he has been there for us as a senator and he will be as president
4267930 with all of this anti immigration sentiment today latinos are just not very popular we have a much better chance to pass this legislation if we protect blacks and asians and well consider adding protections for latinos in a few years when things calm down
4267931 her voice is still as sublime as when she was with motown
4267932 i want to get out there and see if the desire to do it again next year is still there
4267933 we feel badly about this but believe that for this to be the best experience for all parties and to ensure appropriate consistency and continuity of the process it would be best to postpone the meeting until the new commissioner is named
4267934 weve now written to president monson and asked if another general authority can be designated to meet with us
4267935 the reason the august meeting with affirmation was postponed is clearly given in the letter
4267936 the meeting was put on hold until august at affirmations request
4267937 i suspect the younger crowd is much less willing to be second class or just to leave the church over it i really think they want to have both
4267938 i do worry a little bit that there wont be any follow through now but i still have some faith in the church its run by people doing what they can to make lives better i think they want to serve all of their members
4267939 san diegos community of gay men and lesbians need to move forward table this ridiculous bickering and together focus on the daunting task ahead of defeating prop 8
4267940 you cant please all of the people all of the time
4267941 the dykes on bikes leading our parades sent a message to the world that we were not to be fucked with
4267942 how convenient it is that this contingent came along at this particular point in time
4267943 shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate
4267944 caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint
4267945 argued everything from the old standby that gay people are child molesters to the argument that talking about being gay might turn straight students gay
4267946 thankfully the court saw through this and agreed with us
4267947 to restrict club discussions of sexual issues that the school is concerned could lead to premature sexualization and risky sexual experimentation on the part of students
4267948 you shouldnt have to grow up feeling like youre alone
4267949 it was just terrible i saw that something was wrong and im trying to change it
4267950 to not support this in east county is to end your life in politics
4267951 it is an inappropriate topic and promotes discrimination and hate
4267952 the trustees of the ghusd ran and were voted in solely for the purpose of effecting school policies and school politics
4267953 one need only spend a few minutes on the internet to find resolutions on everything from renewable energy to iraq policy to global warming passed by local political entities that do not have any direct authority over the issue being debated
4267954 my position is relatively simple i endorse a definition of marriage that has existed throughout recorded human history and is in sync with every major religious tradition in the world
4267955 californias constitution should guarantee the same freedoms and rights to everyone
4267956 no one group should be singled out to be treated differently
4267957 to not support this in east county is to end your life in politics
4267958 we are thrilled that people from across california and the nation are donating to the cause
4267959 just this month we have raised approximately another 2 million volunteers at our phone banks are giving people visiting our web site are giving and contributions both large and small are strengthening our campaign
4267960 our opponents have said they will raise and spend 10 15 million dollars
4267961 the generous support of our donors means we will more than match them and have a full communications campaign for the california voters
4267962 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
4267963 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
4267964 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
4267965 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
4267966 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
4267967 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
4267968 the question is one of timeliness and we dont believe the judge rightly applied the law
4267969 in a pre election context time is of the essence
4267970 would lead to absurd results and potentially culminate in the disenfranchisement of otherwise eligible voters
4267971 i firmly believe that the voters of montgomery county will reject discrimination
4267972 apesar deste expressivo resultado os valores correspondentes em reais tiveram retra o de 9
4267973 that sounds like its going to be a collectors item
4267974 i realized it was a mistake like finding a coin thats been damaged in the making so i quickly ordered 10 of them
4267975 they were probationary officers and their conduct is not the kind of conduct we would tolerate
4267976 if youre a guy you think this is no big deal and if youre a woman youre insulted considering were 52 percent of the population
4267977 i thought i must have picked up the wrong legislation because it was all he this he that when nursing is predominantly a female profession
4267978 there are a lot more women attorneys today than there were 20 or 30 years ago and there are a lot more men than there were 20 or 30 years ago who would be offended if they thought something was targeted at men only instead of men and women
4267979 you should avoid even the possibility of offending someone by redrafting the language its not that hard to do
4267980 auntie helens is one of the first organizations that saw a need in the early years of aids and worked tirelessly to offer valuable services for those affected in our community
4267981 twenty years later auntie helens continues its outstanding service of making life better for those living with aids and hiv
4267982 its a wonderful thing to be the only type of service like this offered in the san diego area and to have been around for so long to serve the community
4267983 what is even greater is the love and support that auntie helens has received throughout the years from all san diegans not only through cash donations but also personal items and clothes as well as the great volunteer support base
4267984 all awards put aside the rewards we get by doing the work we do and volunteering at auntie helens is worth it

4267986 angie she was a fun loving young woman who was taken from us far too early

4267988 greeley is a very tolerant community very sensitive to diversity
4267989 you in the church of england have so many gay clergy gay partnered clergy gay couples who are both clergy the bishops know it their congregations know it but can you get anyone to talk about it oh no i think its a holdover from victorian times
4267990 the scriptures were written in patriarchal times times of slavery times of polygamy and when you go for a literalist reading you run into trouble women wear hats in church for example because st paul said you should keep your head covered and your mouth shut by the way
4267991 the pull of precedent is powerful but scarcely all powerful when a shift of personnel or perspective breaks the spell allowing the forces of change to exert their counterpull the road from bowers v hardwick the 1986 decision that dismissed a claim of gay rights as at best facetious to lawrence v texas which 17 years later located the privacy rights of gay men and lesbians at the heart of constitutional due process was paved i have no doubt by the justices experience of knowing gay men and women in their personal and professional lives
4267992 everyone is so post gay now its probably not the done thing to shed a tear over the last night of g a y at the astoria in central london this saturday with its simple delight in fluffy disco and boozy cruisey merriment g a y seems a dinosaur in the modern landscape of gay indie clubs mixed clubs and the pansexual drag tastic dives of shoreditch where the beestung lipped boy in eyeshadow probably has a girlfriend whos cool with it all
4267993 my girlfriend gave me a tiffany diamond ring and proposed i cried we want to make sure to get married before the ballots in november but we both have hectic traveling schedules its more whirlwind than romance but were hoping for the first weekend in september
4267994 it was really exciting but it was a fuck up too you can think you have the capacity to deal with it fame but nothing prepares you for it i really thought i didnt care that i could be famous and not be altered by it but you are you get caught up in it and some of it is real but for the most part its superficial and very fragile or temporary
4267995 we made a commitment and we understood the controversy but we are now aware the labor council had voted for an official boycott
4267996 that the whole thing of it is fun its different every day compare that to actually working its just that i love everything about it ive been hooked on movies and movie making forever
4267997 i was a little girl in mining camps in canada and in quebec in those days kids werent allowed to go to the movies
4267998 so the only way you got to see movies was when the priest would show them in the church basement i saw a couple of movies and one of the bush pilots brought in a movie magazine and i decided i wanted to be a movie star
4267999 i didnt know anything about acting then when i was 11 my mom took us kids to new york and i got to go see bye bye birdie with dick van dyke and michael j pollard and i sat there and said thats what im going to do it was just something that i always knew id do and i never let it occur to me i wouldnt be successful i was so single minded and dumb about it when i was young i didnt know thered be a chance id fail so you just kind of plow ahead
4268000 and that was tom mankiewicz who did the final rewrite although hes called a creative consultant and he brought this fabulous almost 30s sensibility to it so that there was a wit to the lines and it was amusing on many levels when youre given lines as delicious as the ones he wrote for me you kinda cant lose
4268001 all i knew to bring to it was when i was in love with a guy i acted like a total asshole around him
4268002 and when i had a guy in love with me who i wasnt interested in i was rather curt at full strength i applied that reality to my portrayal luckily i have no more hormones left so i dont have to go back to those days
4268003 i think they are funny i think horror movies are ridiculous and if they are not funny whats the point in watching them
4268004 i think i found a niche when i was very young as a scream queen and there are a lot of fans who are passionate about those kinds of movies so thats fun at my advanced age to look back and see how things turned out
4268005 i dont have any problems when anyone says what was your most embarrassing moment and you go flipping out in public it kind of takes the cake
4268006 the way to go about making yourself better is different in every single individuals case
4268007 i subscribe to a type of medicine called orthomolecular in which you see those certain things emotional swings and thought pattern disruptions as symptoms of something organically wrong
4268008 so you find out what it is thats wrong and whats causing those symptoms and you fix it organically i am very much
4268009 god george bush makes me want to slash my wrists hes so embarrassing i have to leave the room when hes on the news what a monkey
4268010 the younger gay women have not experienced as much discrimination as the older women
4268011 and i think its such a hopeful sign of how far weve come i think its really wonderful but it discrimination and hate crimes certainly exists in small towns in the same way its portrayed in the movie there are some towns in montana where its pretty rough
4268012 its about changing attitudes and i think there have been such leaps forward made in this arena that there is such a thing as having these wonderful shows and this series where the primary thing isnt about the lead character being gay its kind of an afterthought which is really refreshing i had such a great time doing it id work for that channel again in a heartbeat
4268013 iglhrc calls upon its partners and friends to join us in condemning the arrest and torture of mukwaya and the violation of lgbt human rights in uganda by the government and its agents

4268019 cityfest is an annual arts and crafts fair held in hillcrest on the second sunday in august every year attracting over 100 000 people to the area for one day
4268020 fifth avenue becomes a mile long venue of tents and visitors stretching from university ave all the way to balboa park
4268021 cityfest began as a celebration of the lighting of the newly renovated hillcrest street sign one of the many vintage neighborhood signs in san diego in 1984
4268022 the residents of hillcrest had so much fun they decided to do it again in 1985 and called it cityfest
4268023 since the first celebration cityfest has become one of the largest if not the largest one day events in california
4268024 artists craft vendors and foodsellers come from all over california and we even have some from arizona and nevada local music is a huge draw with two stages hosting bands continuously all day and two beer gardens near the stages from its humble beginnings as a neighborhood party at the corner of university and fifth its grown to a full sized outdoor arts and crafts festival that keeps on growing
4268025 because of the unique flavor and character of the neighborhood of hillcrest cityfest has a wonderfully diverse energetic crowd including everyone from families with young children to senior citizens to college students to business people to artists the list goes on
4268026 also while not a juried art show vendor participation is selective based on the type of items offered so that the market is not flooded with all one type of product this makes our venue competitive and a great experience for both shoppers and sellers the mix of people and the variety and quality of the arts crafts and services available makes cityfest a truly unique experience
4268027 generally cityfest clears about 20 000 each year that gets invested right back into the neighborhood
4268028 so far this year is looking to be just as beneficial if not better than previous years even in this tricky economy
4268029 cityfest is produced by the hillcrest business association which manages the hillcrest business improvement district as defined by the city of san diego all of the proceeds from cityfest go toward neighborhood improvement projects such as extra street cleaning security detail public space and tree maintenance and programs such as tuesday nite out hillcrest more super sundays our new monthly art walk and the prow program which administers specific permission to business owners to use the sidewalk in front of their building for seating or displays the association also advocates on behalf of the small business owners of hillcrest acting as a liaison with the city residents and neighboring business districts the businesses and residents of hillcrest directly benefit every day from these services and last year the american planning association voted hillcrest one of americas top 10 neighborhoods we must be doing something right

4268037 i was three maybe four up way past my bedtime and i saw a girl named midori on johnny carson playing a vivaldi concerto for violin somehow strangely from that moment on i had it in my head that i was going to be a violinist
4268038 i dont know if it was the sound of the instrument the poised young woman or the affections of johnny carson and the crowd that night that lured me but since that day my desire to make noise and be heard has not ceased our live show has become something of a musical spectacle with live violin sampling bumpin hip hop to classical beats and bass to move you

4268118 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4268119 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

4268121 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
4268122 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4268123 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4268124 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4268125 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4268126 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4268127 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4268128 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4268129 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4268130 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4268131 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4268132 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4268133 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4268134 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement

4268145 mtutu will make a very good coach at some stage but im keen for him to stretch his playing career out for as long as he can before he considers coaching full time he is a very good player at this level and he can provide the greatest input to this team at the moment by playing not coaching he is a great leader and has been working hard following a specialised fitness program after the birth of his daughter in april i expect him to be very damaging during the ic

4268161 color management 10 years back and 10 years forward how times have changed
4268162 being such a dispersed and demanding market the north american market has long been a challenge
4268163 i strongly believe that with dave hunter and the pilot marketing team we have found a partner that will help us provide a better service to both existing and new customers
4268164 while in recent years the industry has made a lot of progress in color standardization we still have a long road ahead in making color management accessible to non experts
4268165 i believe perfectproof has the right approach to achieve this
4268166 in the lfp market that work still has to start
4268167 and we see perfectproofs printfactory as an opportunity to bring our color and workflow knowledge to that market

4268178 one day when luke was being chased by two fbi men with
4268179 christian groups shouldnt be discriminated against for their beliefs and we are pleased with the courts recognition of that
4268180 the court agreed that the government cannot treat people with non religious viewpoints more favorably than people with religious viewpoints it also concluded that its not the librarys job to determine what elements constitute a religious service and then discriminate on that basis
4268181 constitutes unlawful viewpoint discrimination and consequently violates plaintiffs first amendment free speech rights
4268182 christian groups have the same first amendment rights as anyone else in america
4268183 the only wall that separates religious groups from public meeting rooms is the wall built by government officials who fail to understand the constitution
4268184 instead of simply focusing on swimming and gymnastics for the entire olympics we will be adding in other contests of athletic skill such as wrestling table weightlifting all told we hope to provide the world with a view of many sports that they may not have seen for years or even remembered the existence of
4268185 i am just watching the tv here and im realizing that im going to have to pretty much phone every single major athlete in the world and let them know that their sports have been added to the olympics for 2012 im sure there are some great athletes out there who just didnt realize that there was still interest for their sport so well have to get in touch with them and make sure they are included
4268186 its still the olympics you know so i feel like even if athletes are a little perturbed at the fact that they had to wait eight years between competing in olympics theyll probably still want in for 2012
4268187 but if say the greco roman wrestler who could have won gold if he were allowed to compete in
4268188 i mean its not always that easy to just take 20 days off in the middle of summer is it i just hope none of these elite athletes have been forced to actually work for a living with their sports cut from the olympics
4268189 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found

4268206 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4268207 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4268208 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4268211 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4268212 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4268213 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4268214 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4268215 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4268216 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4268217 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions russia has taken against a sovereign state
4268218 were certainly looking at a number of further allegations and making inquires in relation to that
4268219 as far as the likelihood of a timeframe of any further arrests thats something i cant comment on at this stage

4268364 with more than 11 000 seats in the arena at 50 or less we think the pricing is fair and reasonable for individuals and families to enjoy the world class entertainment the nba offers

4268366 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4268367 we must be a leader in ensuring the health and integrity of horses and of this vitally important industry a ban on anabolic steroids is an important part of that process
4268368 toughest no question about it everybody else says you can use stanozolol we hate that drug
4268369 we havent got the authority or right to tell someone who owns a horse what they can give that animal until that horse is placed in the entry box
4268370 its just not possible trainers just cant live under the trauma all the time of an outside horse coming in and not knowing whether that animal has been treated or not
4268371 the withdraw time becomes irrelevant if a horse is positive
4268372 its an excuse not a reason if you say i didnt give him this stuff within 30 days if hes positive tough turtles hes still positive

4268382 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting
4268383 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4268384 to the wonderful response i received to my womens diy kits they were a long time coming but they are finally here more to come in different color combinations as you have so gracious requested
4268385 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4268386 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4268387 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4268388 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4268389 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4268390 different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4268391 largely the violence has died down over the last 24 hours
4268392 he walked around an employee walked in and did meet gwatney
4268393 they introduced themselves at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4268394 she was saying that somebody was in her office shooting a gun and she didnt know if he had been hit
4268395 she was just screaming so we got her behind the counter and locked the door because we didnt know if someone was following her
4268396 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4268397 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4268398 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4268399 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4268400 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4268401 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4268402 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4268403 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
4268404 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4268405 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4268406 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4268407 the air corridors are open for us to take the humanitarian supplies in
4268408 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and back and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
4268409 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4268410 well first of all i think we need to take this in sequences getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
4268411 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated
4268412 ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4268413 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4268414 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4268415 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4268416 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4268417 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4268418 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4268419 if you think things are going to get a lot better with the drop in petroleum prices think again the increases in july were broadbased
4268420 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent
4268421 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation as weekly earnings adjusted for inflation lies below the level they reached in august 1998
4268422 if this administration were competing in the bad economic policy olympics theyd receive four gold medals today
4268423 obamanomics is lavish government spending that must be paid for by new tax increases on a struggling economy
4268424 doping by the pool invalidates phelps beijing 2008 olympic swimming gold world records
4268425 music can have influences on the breathing rate e g via emotional effects such an increased arousal which will alter oxygen levels in the blood or relaxing effects so that fewer muscles consume oxygen which also increases oxygen levels
4268426 has reported clear changes in breathing rate on a conference last year with breathing rate being higher during pleasant music
4268427 duration of the effect is not certain from seconds to minutes
4268428 m usic next to the swimming pool less than 2 minutes before the start could indicate performance enhancement because of transient increase of blood oxygen capacity
4268429 a bio chemical feedback mechanism from an external source the external source in the present case music is available to everyone not harmful to the athlete or his peers and carried out under full disclosure hence i do not see how this conflicts with fair play and honesty
4268430 i am not an expert on the world anti doping agency wada
4268431 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4268432 i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4268433 we are a sports department how would we be able to change their ages
4268434 athletes are continually in a dialogue or negotiation with themselves assessing how fatigued they feel
4268435 adept runners are faster due to their underlying physiological capacity rather than because they put more relative effort into their competition
4268436 when you prepare and go out and run a 10 k the person who wins is probably not running harder
4268437 to me what they are saying is there is a protective system built in that doesnt allow us to overuse our muscles
4268438 when you do something repetitive the body knows how to prevent injury
4268439 is a learned pattern of behavior and the muscles get regulated subconsciously by the brain
4268440 it gives us hope we arent going to kill ourselves
4268441 if you thing things are going to get a lot better with the drop in petroleum prices think again
4268442 the increases were broad based but the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it
4268443 theres less employment theres less wealth and now banks are restraining credit
4268444 we just dont see where the consumer is going to get the money
4268445 the large increases in consumer expenses means that household income is actually declining when adjusted for inflation
4268446 confidence does not improve when the standard of living is declining and with unemployment claims still quite high we cannot expect much out of the consumer
4268447 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july
4268448 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4268449 3 for the price of 2 deal even with this discount it is quite expensive but this would make it a little easier
4268450 a lot of different things will be argued about this case from both sides but the one thing we do know for sure thats not arguable is the fact that he signed this deal indicating that this company was free and clear of lawsuits and then midway through the case we find out he was mired in a major lawsuit over the assets of the company we would never have moved forward with this deal knowing what we know today
4268451 we had high hopes for the both the relationship and the technology provided by xflix llc however the assets and services failed us time and time again which is why we had to move away from their platform and onto our own proprietary one

4268467 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
4268468 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
4268469 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
4268470 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
4268471 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
4268472 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
4268473 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
4268474 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
4268475 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
4268476 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
4268477 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo

4268555 why am i doing this for people who dont even seem to care enough to do anything about it themselves
4268556 we needed to be more dynamic we needed a bit more personality on the field of play
4268557 i thought midtjylland were excellent a big strong team who understood the counter attack game very well
4268558 they knew they were the winner they were just too in shock to do anything about it for a few days
4268559 it related to the scampi inquiry that was done by the select committee some years ago when winston peters did a total 180 degree about face
4268560 credibility on capitol hill one member and staff at a time
4268561 the truth of the matter is this isnt exactly how we would have wished to come to this job
4268562 there have been a number of events that have occurred and collectively have made folks uneasy and understandably so our task in the near term and in the months ahead is to get after this stabilize our situation and recommit ourselves to those things that we know will produce the right outcomes
4268563 there is much less room for poor performance and certainly for misconduct
4268564 we will be active on this and be surgical if thats what is needed
4268565 i think it is safe to say that we see things perhaps a little bit differently
4268566 its all about what we do for the joint team
4268567 it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and well tidy that up and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet

4268572 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4268573 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4268574 you must always be polite and sympathetic it doesnt matter how probing or unwelcome your questions are if it is asked with enough politeness and sympathy and with a smile in your voice the person will often answer particularly if you make it clear you are waiting politely for their sparkling response
4268575 its going to be a very very busy year we might as well brace ourselves for it
4268576 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4268577 theres a lot of talk about change in this election you have to get ready
4268578 we anticipate a much much greater level of activity than weve had in the last few years
4268579 theres going to be a whole lot more activity for people who do what we do
4268580 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4268581 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4268582 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4268583 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4268584 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution

4268587 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal

4268626 our liquidity position in the last 24 hours had significantly deteriorated
4268627 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4268628 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4268629 it is out of the question to talk of recession
4268630 the issue is whether this slowdown is a knee jerk reaction to an inflation shock or something nastier
4268631 for the time being i dont see evidence that it is a downwards spiral
4268632 the main engines that have supported growth over the past three years have run out of steam consumption and business investment and the fuel that has driven those engines moderate inflation and falling unemployment is no longer there
4268633 this stock has not performed well enough to keep in your port imo
4268634 this stock isnt overpriced enough for us to keep it it is too cheap so we should dump it maybe when it takes off and goes way up in may and is too expensive we can buy it again

4268640 we are not convinced that yesterdays move will solve all the multiple challenges facing credit markets and the financial system
4268641 credit concerns are likely to persist and averting a drawn out recession is becoming increasingly challenging
4268642 perhaps at best it only delays the imminency of a very large and growing credit crisis that could well implode into a debt deflation scenario not unlike the 1930s great depression

4268660 we acted robustly well see the effects of this pro growth package why dont we let stimulus package 1 which seemed like a good idea at the time have a chance to kick in im concerned about the economy i dont think were headed to recession

4268697 the song that 40 of your friends have added to their myspace pages in the last week even though you tried to tell them about it not to mention the entire
4268698 what salford conservatives say today will be said nationally tomorrow
4268699 are you saying that you have to have been on strike be a trade unionist and be well over 25 years old to be a councillor
4268700 if you look to your left youll notice an aerial assault on vert
4268701 a baseball is different from a football boys are not girls the score is 4 2 at this point i started to spin in circles made a continuous noise similar to that of a sick cow until i fell on my back where i laid for the rest of the game
4268702 out of the darkness and into the light i left breakfast in bed for this

4268704 het russische leger gaat vergezeld van losgeslagen figuren plunderaars verkrachters brandstichters en dieven
4268705 toen het georgische leger tsinvali innam hebben de russen een bommentapijt laten vallen ze hebben tsinvali tot een ru ne gemaakt precies zoals ze dat hebben gedaan met grozny
4268706 if we see a piece and we like it it comes in its not matchy matchy
4268707 a lot of people think you cant mix a floral area rug with floral wallpaper a decorator would never do it but it works
4268708 every room is different every bed is different ive done it all on my own one room at a time and i have my elephant collection in the common room oh how many elephants there are
4268709 at home they usually just have a regular bathroom situation but this is the place to relax and rejuvenate
4268710 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4268711 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4268712 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4268713 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4268714 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4268715 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4268716 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4268717 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4268718 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4268719 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4268720 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4268721 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4268722 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4268723 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4268724 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4268725 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4268726 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4268727 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4268728 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4268729 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4268730 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4268731 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life

4268740 violence stinks no matter what side of it youre on
4268741 to those blaming african americans for not coming forward regarding crime i ask this if you and or your family firmly believed that coming forward would result in your family being threatened or killed or your property vandalized would you do it
4268742 do people on both sides of the racial divide even want and search for a solutions
4268743 i dont think that the dccc should be so closed minded i think that they should be open to endorsing and actively supporting greens and independents especially since cindy sheehan easily deserves an endorsement over nancy pelosi
4268744 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president barack obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tyre inflation
4268745 its hard to image that more than 120 000 children in colorado suffer from hunger

4268748 despite a 24 1 percent increase in the weighted average shares outstanding to 51 3 million shares from 41 4 million shares in the prior year period
4268749 its a election year and wed like to see a democrat get to be president
4268750 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4268751 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4268752 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4268753 as we stated last week we believe weve made a fair offer and we look forward to a response from imclones board on that offer
4268754 while the news regarding a potential imclone restructuring was unexpected imclones response to the initial bristol myers offer was not
4268755 accordingly the board is reviewing whether bristol myers had access to confidential information concerning imclone and its pipeline
4268756 can a cynical comedy writer and his actress wife learn anything from an adopted dog youll laugh watching them try because its a true story and a touching story but mostly just a funny story

4268758 we are committed to that being rolled out so that every single bus in our fleet will have a bike rack on the front of it and so that means retrofitting some and buying new ones with them already on it
4268759 members were not necessarily embracing the offer with great enthusiasm the reality of it is that the bargaining process has taken a long time
4268760 the election has played a part in terms of members wanting some certainty rather than uncertainty however in accepting the offer i think our members message has also been that this offer hasnt been embraced with enthusiasm
4268761 its quite clear at the moment theyre over 10 officers down
4268762 they are running the communications staff on double shifts where our guys are calling in on overtime on their rostered days off
4268763 its really starting to deplete and run our officers into the ground you might say at the moment and we believe its pretty critical
4268764 whats going to happen if weve got tired people in there doing double shifts working overtime on their days off
4268765 its an area for mistakes theres no doubt about that
4268766 wed hate to see patients compromised which is why we want management to get in there fix it
4268767 this will have absolutely no impact on the general public it will just make it hard or impossible for st johns to bill people for their travel
4268768 the banning of paperwork is really something thats designed to put some sort of financial pressure on our organisation
4268769 if the government needs to respond to anything in the next few months that money is available
4268770 but the majority of this 97 million is really a technical adjustment based on the fact that we didnt have a major event that caused us to expend a lot of our insurance provisions
4268771 its not like its a large windfall for the territory although its good
4268772 we have got issues with teacher shortages and the deployment of staffing being left at local decision making will only exacerbate problems
4268773 we would be extremely disappointed if the government changed and they bought this in without consultation

4268776 quake and floods offer the catastrophe cover opportunity for us in india in addition we are also keen on providing primary insurance cover to sectors like motor marine aviation engineering and power sectors
4268777 in less than a year we plan to start our primary insurance operations in india
4268778 we have all the required skills except the distribution network we would mostly look at our partner for filling up that gap
4268779 if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote
4268780 the criminals had made video footage of their life in jail in the clippings they are seen cooking with stove kerosene and other materials apart from this sachin shete leader of the three gangsters is seen being given a leisurely massage by a fellow inmate the three criminals are also filmed relaxing and strolling inside the jail
4268781 we had heard seen or read about gangsters enjoying life inside the jails in books and films or have heard a few tales about how high profile gangsters of yesteryears would enjoy such life but it is astonishing that criminals and gangsters today also are being given such liberties especially someone who is serving life imprisonment for murder
4268782 we found that the accused had made phone calls from inside the jail which made us suspicious
4268783 i think people will rather save than spend also with prices rising the way they have people might have to shell out extra money for the same basket of things they were buying earlier
4268784 the first phase of the renovation including the function rooms the grand ballroom the cotillion room and the foyer were completed in january 2007
4268785 we have made inquiries about some of the men who were subjected to the tests we suspect they may have links with simi however the tests shall give us some clue to that
4268786 there were offices and cadres of simi in navi mumbai two of the members were very active but they are absconding and are under police scanner
4268787 ahmedabad police have got cctv images of some suspects but they have not yet given the footage copy to us sometimes they do share information with us but sometimes they dont

4268794 its the kind of attack we have not seen much of in recent years
4268795 if theres one thing that always strikes me after a tragedy like this its the way the development community pulls itself together and really demonstrates its resolve to continue to work in this country
4268796 many people believe the insurgency is reacting to some extent to the progress in the country and the fact that they havent been able to stop the progress
4268797 its the kind of attack we have not seen much of in recent years

4268800 a method of using high quality photographs to enhance a video taken of the same subject the project page gives a good overview of what they are doing and the video on the page gives some really nice examples of how their technology works hopefully someone can take the technology and run with it but one things for sure this could make amateur video making look even better than it does now

4268803 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4268804 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4268805 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4268806 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4268813 theyre the best team in the world but we deserved to beat them tonight
4268814 it was our game to take we just made a name for ourselves no one should take us lightly
4268815 with all the teams that are so good here you cant let a game slip
4268816 if we would have beat them that would have put a lot of pressure on them theyd have a couple must wins
4268817 if we continue to play in that fashion well definitely be in the medal rounds
4268818 thats a fine showing by great young men that just refused to give in thats what were looking for
4268819 were probably going to get better pitching as we get going but for tonights game thats what team canada is made of

4268823 we are playing with peoples livelihoods here the competition between retailers is intense if they are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money then all well and good but we know both historically and from bitter experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance they dont often give up any of their margin for long
4268824 we recognise that customers are struggling we have had a good six to eight months but our costs are going up and confidence is fragile this price cutting could force more farmers to go under
4268825 steel futures and energy prices are coming down from their peak and if we deliver the building later we hope it will be launched into the peak of the next upturn for city rents

4268827 the secretary and chief of staff of the air force have considered delaying currently planned actions on air force cyber command to allow ample time for a comprehensive assessment of all afcyber requirements and to synchronize the afcyber mission with other key air force initiatives

4268865 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
4268866 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4268867 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
4268868 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4268869 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4268870 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

4268901 because of reductions in staff and space the sunday real estate section has printed its final edition
4268902 theres a journalism term for finishing an editions work you put the section to bed when i started as a part timer in this department under then editor dick turpin i never dreamed that one day id be putting the section to bed for good
4268903 it was informative plenty of question and answer columns for renters condo and home owners presented the facts and provided some entertainment
4268904 im more of a news business sports guy so i didnt read the real estate section
4268905 but i am disturbed by the prospect of some of our big city papers being dramatically downsized or going away the internet is great at distributing other peoples content but not so much at originating it papers like the l a times imperfect though they may be still frequently play an important role in keeping our other institutions honest
4268906 im probably not going to miss the real estate section the only thing i ever read in the real estate section was the story of how some self absorbed celebrity is selling his mansion for 10 million which was always curiously 8 million more than similar sized homes in the same area
4268907 theyre not going to accept anymore syndicated material theres not anywhere to put it
4268908 i had read that section since i was a little kid
4268909 just recorded its biggest month ever in june with 115 million page views a 50 percent increase over last year
4268910 real estate advertisers during this downturn are going to be trying the web some of them for the first time and once they do they wont go back
4268911 it is not surprising that newspapers are starting to scale back their real estate sections the decision by the l a times is an example of things that were going to see more of as newspapers manage the contraction of their business which is what metro daily newspapers are going to be about for the foreseeable future
4268912 truly fundamental shifts are taking place in the advertising industry and a lot of advertising media are not coming back advertisers are going to be hard pressed to justify spending money on things they now know are inefficient
4268913 driven largely by a 23 percent fall in real estate classifieds
4268914 newspapers are beginning to understand that their most valuable franchise is not local news but local sales information
4268915 the epiphany that newspaper managers are beginning to experience is that local news and community information as opposed to national news may not attract a large or particularly attractive audience for small advertisers
4268916 ive had some problems with palm treo buttons i e keypad keys i guess they get dirty down inside and need cleaning the symptom is that i have to press the key very hard to get it to work that makes typing difficult of course
4268917 should that be the case it poses a distinct threat to south florida

4268919 i really like the dooney amp bourke centro wristlet i find it to be stylish yet casual i think the case would go great with dress pants and blue jeans as well i like the color of the case and the material feels sturdy and long lasting my centro is well protected inside the case and is safe from dings and scratches the pockets in the case are very rigid so thats extra protection there are small openings on the sides of the case so your centro could possibly get wet in a downpour but its not very likely
4268920 it would be fun and we still have some time to kill

4268990 hey girl you are sweet i think i like you
4268991 yes i am a lesbian but i dont mean that i will try to get you i just want to tell you my feeling
4268992 all the fairest beauties of the soul are those that are rarely seen and can only be guessed at

4268994 all the ladies made a huge effort and a lot of thought was put into the various outfits meaning the standard was the highest ever and our judges had a difficult time picking the winners
4268995 now everyone is looking forward to ladies day final when more silver coins will be won and 27 girls will then draw a horse running in the silver cup and have a chance of winning a terrific prize
4268996 when youre by yourself and your mind can wander a bit ive had some pretty amazing characters walk into my brain or i get a big what if idea or a scene
4268997 its about two people trying to figure out what it means to be in love with each other and thats what happened to me and i chose to write about it
4268998 maybe people want to hear what you think rather than what you think happens in the world
4268999 people are just drawn to each other even if its unhealthy its not something they want in their brain its something they want in their heart
4269000 its something they cant live without and a lot of the time its something they cant live with either
4269001 i love plays that have some kind of big tense focus to them the stakes are so high that something explosive has to happen
4269002 often in scripts from young people there are so many locations that its difficult to deal with on the stage
4269003 but the last thing im interested in is trying to shoo any of that energy away before its down on paper im far more interested in figuring out how to get that car on stage than telling them its not a good idea
4269004 were just trying to figure out how a mother and daughter would relate to each other if the mother was diagnosed with breast cancer
4269005 since she has had so much life experience she had a well of emotions to draw from
4269006 she kicked my butt its radical how much life experience trumps training
4269007 members were not necessarily embracing the offer with great enthusiasm the reality of it is that the bargaining process has taken a long time
4269008 the election has played a part in terms of members wanting some certainty rather than uncertainty however in accepting the offer i think our members message has also been that this offer hasnt been embraced with enthusiasm
4269009 its quite clear at the moment theyre over 10 officers down
4269010 they are running the communications staff on double shifts where our guys are calling in on overtime on their rostered days off
4269011 its really starting to deplete and run our officers into the ground you might say at the moment and we believe its pretty critical
4269012 whats going to happen if weve got tired people in there doing double shifts working overtime on their days off
4269013 its an area for mistakes theres no doubt about that
4269014 wed hate to see patients compromised which is why we want management to get in there fix it
4269015 this will have absolutely no impact on the general public it will just make it hard or impossible for st johns to bill people for their travel
4269016 the banning of paperwork is really something thats designed to put some sort of financial pressure on our organisation
4269017 we have burgeoning arrangements for oversight elsewhere in the state and clearly the links that have been pointed to with organised crime do cry out for broader independent anti corruption investigation
4269018 there have clearly been problems pointed to by judge lewis report serious problems and problems that must be addressed
4269019 the deputy premier rob hulls has got to take some responsibility for his inaction and his failure to act and in a timely way
4269020 i absolutely take responsibility for gordon lewis report we will continue to do whatever we can to stamp out criminal behaviour whenever or wherever it occurs
4269021 we are making it quite clear that things have been done in such a way that has made us a leader in australia when it comes to racing but that doesnt mean that we rest on our laurels and we in my view have to continue to look at the way were doing things and do things better where we can
4269022 i think that the racing industry is the best industry in australia
4269023 short of trying to drive through the firefighters once he did stop and get out we were able to say to him that we were disgusted by his attempts to hold down our wages at the moment and moreso were disgusted by the attacks and the threats that his governments making against the community and the fire safety of nsw
4269024 my daughters been off sick all week and i needed to take her with me so she wasnt left alone and i had my arm around her and holding her close by as i was standing by mr costa
4269025 at one stage he made a statement and she said im only 10 and i know thats a lie
4269026 while he refused to shake my hand as an union official he did shake the hand of one of the firefighters here to meet with us and try and nut out some sort of a negotiation before the court case next week
4269027 its just a question now of nutting out all of the details i think people do understand that weve got very big infrastructure priorities here on the gold coast
4269028 the future success of our regional economy and our quality of life depends on a safe secure and reliable source of water

4269032 this kind of information on recreational fisheries will ensure representation of recreational values in the design implementation and management of marine protected areas
4269033 participation is vital to ensure that the areas anglers value the most remain open to recreational fishing
4269034 is there a significant health risk based upon a difference between nine and 11 parts per billion
4269035 probably not even measurable but the standard is ten and we have to get in compliance
4269036 if the government needs to respond to anything in the next few months that money is available
4269037 but the majority of this 97 million is really a technical adjustment based on the fact that we didnt have a major event that caused us to expend a lot of our insurance provisions
4269038 its not like its a large windfall for the territory although its good
4269039 building a peripheral canal is not without controversy but it appears to be the best way to maintain a reliable water supply

4269042 when you talk about projects that move water around the state that solve some of the states problems thats one of them
4269043 were not bogged down in the politics that mire sacramento
4269044 weve got one goal to deliver water to our farmers and facilitate agriculture and we can talk to other districts to mid the tid guys or ssjid south san joaquin irrigation district its simple projects can move forward like that
4269045 tid cant afford to pay for them alone but if somebody wanted to partner with us
4269046 its going to take smaller folks who have the desire and leadership and drive to do it
4269047 however weve already done that the modesto and turlock districts collectively saw a need first in the late 1800s and again in the 1960s they took the leadership role financed it and went out and did what needed to be done as a result you have don pedro merced did the same thing on exchequer and south san joaquin and oakdale did it at new melones we have taken leadership roles and met the challenges and now were reaping the benefits of that investment
4269048 it was a watershed moment when we recognized that a big part of the solution comes at the local and regional scale
4269049 the picture was taken about an hour after we heard the noises but we didnt see anything at the time
4269050 when we saw it when we were looking back through the pictures we were gobsmacked
4269051 were saying that its a soldier some people can see it sitting on a horse and some people just see it as a walking soldier
4269052 there was a media frenzy about toxic mold and the folks writing homeowners insurance got hit hard it drove up premiums quite a bit
4269053 insurance premiums should reflect the risk and people agree with that in principle but not in practice
4269054 but its also a public policy issue to take care of people who cant afford it
4269055 catastrophe modeling is more of an art than a science

4269058 we talked a lot with the schools and it was shocking to see the amount of students within our school system who were obese
4269059 nobody would dispute that we are experiencing an epidemic of obesity in this country
4269060 children as young as 7 years old are experiencing health consequences of being overweight suggesting that intervention must occur as early as possible and involve the entire family
4269061 teachers actually have a really big influence on what children eat i hate to say it but even more so than the parents at this young age especially if they are in school from 7 am to 6 pm
4269062 will impact policy around the country leading to healthier standards for meals served at childcare centers
4269063 if we are successful in improving attitudes toward nutrition and physical activity in early childhood we can potentially influence adult behavior and begin to hope that the public health epidemic of obesity can be ended
4269064 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
4269065 about 70 percent of the water we use is put into our landscaping
4269066 our study demonstrates that even people with normal weight may have excessive body fat and that these people are at risk for metabolic abnormalities that lead to diabetes and eventually to heart disease
4269067 combined the data from our earlier work and the current study suggest its time for a new measure of body fat as a risk factor of heart disease
4269068 research shows that for example if a midwife is obese she is less likely to bring up the subject of obesity and information to the mother like breast feeding makes a child less likely to be fat
4269069 when she passed she was calm and peaceful it was like she had a smile on her face
4269070 you look at a person of our size you dont see the struggle that they deal with on an every day basis
4269071 they basically say im too big to have the surgery
4269072 when i first met her she was about my size im not little and it just progressed she did fine until the miscarriage and then the depression it was like she just gave up then whenever she was ready to try it was too late
4269073 i couldnt save her no matter how hard i tried now ive got to honor that by taking care of me
4269074 affordability is at an all time low and like with alcohol that just leads people to use more or stronger drugs whether it is a student using skunk a form of cannabis that is ten times stronger than the typical joint or a city workers cocaine binge
4269075 the rise in admissions can also be explained by using multiple drugs in greater quantities or purity all this will have an effect on your health
4269076 overall class a drug use has stabilised with the exception of cocaine which has risen over the past ten years as prices have fallen and is responsible for increases in hospital admissions for overdoses
4269077 these alarming figures reveal a wasted generation how many more lives will be lost before the government takes effective action we need better education and more powers to tackle the dealers who profit from this misery
4269078 this order reflects the growing excitement around our new learjet 85 program in latin america and worldwide
4269079 the learjet 85 jet is the latest example of how the evolving learjet aircraft family is well suited to respond to the changing needs of latin american operators
4269080 we want to offer our customers the best business aircraft possible and we believe the learjet 85 aircraft will meet and even exceed their high standards
4269081 we are playing with peoples livelihoods here the competition between retailers is intense if they are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money then all well and good but we know both historically and from bitter experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance they dont often give up any of their margin for long
4269082 we recognise that customers are struggling we have had a good six to eight months but our costs are going up and confidence is fragile this price cutting could force more farmers to go under
4269083 it was not a safety concern the engineers were just checking the aircraft
4269084 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of
4269085 unbelievable im still shaking ive never seen anything like this before
4269086 im just tired of all the stalkers so i had my brother dr van buren come down im just glad you all had something to do on the weekend
4269087 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4269088 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4269089 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4269090 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4269091 the reduction in violence did not just come as a gift
4269092 the soi members keep demanding jobs with the iraqi security forces because that will solve the problem with unemployment
4269093 i think it makes sense to bring sons of iraq into the security forces because its a force for stability
4269094 the employment advantages are obvious but also if you have volunteers that only strengthens the security forces
4269095 from a policy perspective we dont want to see any delay
4269096 iraq is a new enough democracy that they need practice in elections another reason is we had seen the sunnis sit out the 2005 elections so its important that this go around they participate and that all of the people of iraq participate
4269097 my very strong impression not just from this trip but in other visits is that people are dissatisfied with the performance of the local governments and want to address that through the elections
4269098 part of voter turnout will depend on the quality of the candidates if they are attractive candidates with attractive platforms it will lead to a greater voter turnout
4269099 there is so much overlap in finding solutions to problems its no longer as discrete as it once was
4269100 civil military or diplomatic military cooperation is essential and its the wave of the future
4269101 my sense is that the iraqi government is not spending money quickly
4269102 i would think there would be more effort to fund programs
4269103 its always a danger to analyze things in the middle east using america as a context

4269118 i thought the offense did some good things from time to time but i dont think were very physical up front right now
4269119 i think the defense still needs to improve but again for our second scrimmage i thought our defense did some good things
4269120 on the offensive front i dont think were as physical as we need to be
4269121 but again i think were going up against some really good people well get back and look at the film last scrimmage i wasnt very pleased at all with the offensive front but once we looked at the film it wasnt as bad as we thought and i think the same will be true with this scrimmage
4269122 i just want to show everybody what i can do
4269123 i dont have goals i just want to show everybody what i can do and what i can do to help this team win
4269124 i think we have a few kids on the second team defense that are challenging for playing time and thats good i still think we have a ways to go with the offensive side of the ball however
4269125 i think the defense still needs to improve but again for our second scrimmage i thought our defense did some good things
4269126 it was pretty similar to the first scrimmage i thought the offense did some good things from time to time but i dont think were very physical up front right now i dont think were running the ball the way we need to right now i think we do some good things in the throwing game but we cant hang our hats on that i think we still need to improve quite a bit
4269127 our defensive front is two deep and we have some pretty good players in there on the offensive front i dont think were as physical as we need to be but again i think were going up against some really good people well get back and look at the film last scrimmage i wasnt very pleased at all with the offensive front but once we looked at the film it wasnt as bad as we thought and i think the same will be true with this scrimmage
4269128 i think the problem on the offensive line right now is when you have one guy that isnt pulling his weight it ruins the entire football play so we need to get five guys working together were somewhat in that direction with the first unit but were not even in the ballpark with the second group
4269129 ive been learning a lot and just getting ready for the season its been going good
4269130 i just want to show everybody what i can do i dont have goals i just want to show everybody what i can do and what i can do to help this team win
4269131 we are good friends i learn a lot from him if i come out of a game the first person i ask advice from is him i get his input on things he does the same with me hell come out of the game and ask me how he did we have a pretty good relationship
4269132 i think over the past two years weve had some really good defenses with some experienced players and very good leaders this year we have a lot of guys who played as freshmen and sophomores so they got a lot of experience under their belts i definitely think we have the potential to be the best defense here but we still have a lot to work on and look forward to

4269188 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4269189 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4269190 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4269191 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4269192 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4269193 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4269194 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4269195 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4269196 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4269198 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4269199 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4269200 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4269201 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4269202 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index

4269272 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4269300 you could hear the engine it just sounded like somebody stuck their foot to the gas pedal and it wasnt a gradual turn it was like somebody jerked the steering wheel sharp to the right

4269303 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4269304 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4269305 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4269306 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4269307 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4269308 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4269309 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4269310 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4269311 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4269312 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4269313 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4269314 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4269315 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4269316 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4269317 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4269318 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4269319 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4269320 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4269321 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4269322 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4269323 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4269324 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4269325 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4269326 i am delighted with this development that creates an excellent opportunity for phoenix to grow and become a significant player in the aerospace market i have worked with this customer in the past and i am satisfied to renew the business relationship and develop a fruitful long lasting cooperation

4269332 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4269333 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4269334 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4269341 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4269342 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all the place
4269343 its the kind of attack we have not seen much of in recent years
4269344 if theres one thing that always strikes me after a tragedy like this its the way the development community pulls itself together and really demonstrates its resolve to continue to work in this country
4269345 many people believe the insurgency is reacting to some extent to the progress in the country and the fact that they havent been able to stop the progress
4269346 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4269347 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and first hand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work

4269349 when youre by yourself and your mind can wander a bit ive had some pretty amazing characters walk into my brain or i get a big what if idea or a scene
4269350 its about two people trying to figure out what it means to be in love with each other and thats what happened to me and i chose to write about it
4269351 maybe people want to hear what you think rather than what you think happens in the world
4269352 people are just drawn to each other even if its unhealthy its not something they want in their brain its something they want in their heart
4269353 its something they cant live without and a lot of the time its something they cant live with either
4269354 i love plays that have some kind of big tense focus to them the stakes are so high that something explosive has to happen
4269355 often in scripts from young people there are so many locations that its difficult to deal with on the stage
4269356 but the last thing im interested in is trying to shoo any of that energy away before its down on paper im far more interested in figuring out how to get that car on stage than telling them its not a good idea
4269357 were just trying to figure out how a mother and daughter would relate to each other if the mother was diagnosed with breast cancer

4269366 despite the 40 improvement in our results our goal remains to create meaningful shareholder value and management feels we are on our way to doing so we still have issues to work through and are very appreciative of the support our valued business partners are providing in helping us get back on track in this challenging economic climate
4269367 the tv climate has changed in that theres very few slots for dramas or for the things that i wanted to do

4269448 ed while i believe that there is way too much hate in the world and i do my best not to add anymore the truly personal nature of the gaunts case and the seemingly obvious fault on the drivers behalf leaves me stunned with a verdict such as this i know that mr johnson has probably suffered plenty and is probably a good person but im left feeling angry and yes a little hateful toward the jury members and court system i guess this too will pass but in the mean time my thoughts turn toward you and i wonder if you could help me understand how to turn the other cheek
4269449 in so far as possible i try to agree with my adversaries
4269450 when you left home this morning how long did you expect to be gone

4269460 you cant talk about one community more like three one is ambivalent one is welcoming one is opposed
4269461 there was a second investigation an informal code of conduct investigation that was just concluded this week
4269462 because it is an informal code of conduct investigation the results are not made public if it were a formal code of conduct the sanctions are much more serious and the hearing is public i dont even know the final out come other than there was some form of discipline made after the code of conduct was complete
4269463 i knew you were stuck in traffic its awful here
4269464 you know the publishing business maybe i can still write about motorcycles sometimes who knows right now im writing general articles floating around trying to find my niche

4269466 her most recent stated fave is ducatis 1098 s im really going to miss the throttle jockey column but hey maybe shell blog hint hint
4269467 but so many ads and the tone of so many stories are so obviously sexist exploitative sometimes even misogynistic maybe i need to wait it out a few more years maybe itll take another generation or two i mean do you think they even know theyre being insulting
4269468 but i know what you mean and i get that uncomfortable feeling too
4269469 you know i think it might be because its just such an easy way to market to men

4269477 the pain of finding enterprise information has moved from the piles of paper on the desktop and in storage cabinets to the digital landfill of file servers e mail inboxes digital desktops and content management systems
4269478 despite the advances made in search on the internet enterprise search leaves most users frustrated
4269479 respondents still spend far too long looking for information and that their success rate is still too low they avoid their internal search tools in favor of the web
4269480 todays users go to the web to solve all their search problems
4269481 while enterprises are sinking time and resources into their intranets their users are going elsewhere for their information this study indicates that intranet search and information portals are only at the beginning of their adoption phase
4269482 there is a lot of pain and seat of the pants learning going on
4269483 it is clear from all responders that search products at every level even those quick and easy to install are not technologies that implementers can install and then walk away every interviewee even those who would not have ongoing responsibility for administration expects to be involved for the long term in some capacity to ensure positive outcomes for users
4269484 the real value of search and information access technologies is in the ongoing efforts needed to establish effective taxonomies and to index and classify content of all kinds to provide meaningful results

4269490 if were going to keep the caucus system there should be an extended time period between the primary and the senatorial conventions
4269491 you program a period of time where credential challenges are determined
4269492 theres strong feelings all over the place about this issue
4269493 the issue is a visceral divisive issue that would not be appropriate to take up at this convention
4269494 end the texas two step count votes equally primary system only
4269495 we are very pleased that the eu member states have given these active ingredients a positive vote
4269496 products with these active ingredients are critical for securing yields in europe especially cereal yields the decision gives basf the assurance it needs to continue investing in next generation products with these compounds helping farmers improve yields and providing consumers with an abundance of safe affordable food
4269497 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4269498 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings

4269508 perhaps this is how the dodgers will finally get mcdonald though i dont think they necessarily need him when berroa essentially gives you the same thing and can actually hit the baseball from time to time
4269509 what is the point of placing a player on waivers if a team does not intend to trade that player is it strictly a salary dump attempt
4269510 berroa offers absolutely nothing hes a stop gap with no actual skills at all
4269511 die kinder sehen zum beispiel das bild eines hundes w hrend sie gleichzeitig das wort
4269512 was selbstverst ndlich nicht bedeutet dass legasthene kinder nicht die bedeutung des wortes banane verstehen jedoch bearbeiten sie die sprache anders als ihre gleichaltrigen normalsprachler
4269513 wir wissen bereits dass je fr her einem kind beim spracherwerb geholfen wird bzw bevor die probleme zu gro werden es die sprachprobleme um so leichter berwinden kann
4269514 der vorteil dieser erkenntnis besteht darin dass man nun erblich legasthenisch belasteten kindern helfen kann bevor die probleme zu gro werden
4269515 typisch ist dass die sprachschwierigkeiten eines kindes nicht beachtet werden bevor diese sich schon auf andere art und weise bemerkbar gemacht haben zum beispiel durch problematisches verhalten oder durch andere psychologische reaktionen
4269516 meine resultate zeigen dass es m glich ist kinder mit legasthenie risiko weitaus fr her zu identifizieren als es heute der fall ist
4269517 sprechschwierigkeiten sowie lese und schreibprobleme h ngen oft miteinander zusammen doch die eigentlichen ursachen und wie diese zum ausdruck kommen variieren von kind zu kind
4269518 generell wissen wir sehr wenig ber das sprachverst ndnis bei babys und kleinkindern da sie ja nicht mit hilfe von interviews oder anderen traditionellen methoden getestet werden k nnen
4269519 die von mir benutzte technik erm glicht das studieren des verstehensprozesses ohne dass das kind selbst etwas sagen oder machen muss
4269520 aai can develop these two airports as models and compete with private sector in developing world class projects they can even compete in international arena both the projects involve large investment and will be completed within three years
4269521 the union budget is already in deficit and on top of that the finance minister failed to make a provision for the pay hike
4269522 the expenditure on account of additional payments will have to be met either by increasing taxes or cutting down on subsidies or by deferring some planned and non planned expenditure
4269523 we have burgeoning arrangements for oversight elsewhere in the state and clearly the links that have been pointed to with organised crime do cry out for broader independent anti corruption investigation
4269524 there have clearly been problems pointed to by judge lewis report serious problems and problems that must be addressed
4269525 the deputy premier rob hulls has got to take some responsibility for his inaction and his failure to act and in a timely way
4269526 i absolutely take responsibility for gordon lewis report we will continue to do whatever we can to stamp out criminal behaviour whenever or wherever it occurs
4269527 we are making it quite clear that things have been done in such a way that has made us a leader in australia when it comes to racing but that doesnt mean that we rest on our laurels and we in my view have to continue to look at the way were doing things and do things better where we can
4269528 i think that the racing industry is the best industry in australia
4269529 believe me i was not trying to show my lack of emotion
4269530 once i won the gold a sort of emptiness took over my feelings i felt like climbing a mountain and nothing more to achieve
4269531 i had some trouble before the start of the event now that it is over i dont want to talk on this subject anymore
4269532 it was my day so i won the medal in our team all others are highly talented shooters and capable of winning any day it was sheer luck they did not win in beijing
4269533 i am confident that indians are capable of winning at least 15 medals in the olympics
4269534 at the moment i need to take a break then i will see how to motivate myself again
4269535 in the area of origin we found an electrical sub distribution board which was extensively damaged
4269536 now that is why we have the safety inspector coming to have a look to find out whether that was post fire or the cause of the fire
4269537 it was difficult for firefighters to gain access to the seat of the fire so to achieve that they brought in an excavator
4269538 the excavator was required to remove quite a lot of debris from the area for them to access the seat of the fire which gave them the ability to put out the fire
4269539 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4269540 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4269541 the general idea here is to strengthen consumer privacy protections and ensure that consumers are aware of who is collecting their information and when they are collecting it
4269542 he has a lot of serious concerns about dpi tracking and feels very strongly that consumer should have to opt in to that kind of tracking
4269543 i know you heard me yellin at you in the parking lot
4269544 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
4269545 we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
4269546 there are strong grounds for preventing streaming and possibly even for strengthening our anti streaming rules
4269547 at the same time the government would like to hear peoples views on whether the anti streaming rules inhibit valid commercial transactions and whether streaming should be allowed in some circumstances
4269548 if mutual recognition does proceed it would be sensible to make our anti streaming rules as compatible as possible this could obviously affect the outcome of this review
4269549 even if mutual recognition were not to proceed any moves to allow limited streaming in new zealand would have to be discussed with australia under our existing trans tasman imputation arrangements

4269610 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4269611 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot mr collins said
4269612 the most bonkers invention here is the coffee cooler he said of the circa 1920 metal cylinder which would be plunged into a piping hot cup

4269654 in its original sense copyright was a publishing right only somebody who had rights over the work as a whole the copy as a noun was able to publish and distribute the work individual use was not even addressed if a person wanted to copy the verb an entire book he or she was free to do so individual reproduction was not an economic threat to content publishing because it didnt scale
4269655 the real reason the system is starting to break down now though is that information monopolies simply go against the grain of the internet there are no longer high up front costs to publishing a work of any length a system designed around the high investment model of information distribution is bound to start looking awkward now
4269656 only recently have people started feeling a contrary pull toward less restriction on copyrighted material

4269671 esta tecnolog a no se ve afectada por las condiciones del medio ambiente como es el caso de los pol meros o adhesivos sint ticos que solieron usarse en los a os 70 y 80
4269672 de acuerdo con los estudios realizados en m xico se aplicaron pol meros de acr lico de vinil y de vinil acetato los cuales con las modificaciones clim ticas provocan la degradaci n de la pintura mural misma que se acelera con la humedad
4269673 estos sistemas son eficientes para extraer pol meros nos ayudan a removerlos y luego mediante el uso de nanopart culas los pigmentos se adhieren al carbonato de calcio y este a su vez queda fijo en la pared
4269674 al paso del tiempo la efectividad de la aplicaci n de esta tecnolog a en este lugar ha sido satisfactoria ahora lo hemos contactado para el uso de esta metodolog a en los proyectos de conservaci n experimental de la pintura mural de cholula palenque mayap n y tlatelolco que han sido elegidos por la complejidad que presentan los murales
4269675 en el caso de cholula la pintura fue creada pr cticamente sobre la tierra ha perdido su aglutinante natural y por tanto ha perdido su consistencia en estos momentos nos estamos centrando en el mural los bebedores donde se presentan tres factores da inos la humedad sales y pol meros sint ticos
4269676 las sales al tratar de salir a la superficie van rompiendo los materiales de la pintura y en consecuencia el desprendimiento de sta
4269677 la intervenci n del mural de cholula es un trabajo a mediano plazo toda vez que el tratamiento con nanopart culas despu s de haber sido aplicado requiere de dos o tres meses para tener la reacci n completa de la carbonataci n y se culmine el proceso

4269679 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4269680 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4269681 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4269682 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were

4269702 con la misma realidad con que una empresa privada manejaba arbitrariamente los recursos hoy los vuelos est n saliendo a horario y llegan a horario
4269703 vivimos una transici n donde todos oficialistas y no oficialistas debemos trabajar fuerte para generar las condiciones donde podamos discutir con seriedad para hacer un pa s en serio
4269704 hoy parece que la discusi n se centra en un n mero de dinero de deuda sin ver los or genes de esa deuda manifest gullo pero el debate sobre aerol neas es mucho m s rico y profundo como dijo la presidenta en el sal n blanco ya que est n participando el poder ejecutivo el poder legislativo y el poder judicial y adem s hay un cuarto poder que participa que son los trabajadores quienes tambi n estaban presentes el d a que se lanza el rescate de la empresa
4269705 si la oposici n cree que el tema de aerol neas argentinas es un capricho de la administraci n de cristina o un capricho que comenz con el gobierno de n stor kirchner me parece que se equivoca porque comenz en los a os noventa y creo que hoy no aporta al debate decir qui n estuvo m s malo o menos malo sino que debemos discutir con seriedad para recuperar en las mejores condiciones un patrimonio de toda la sociedad
4269706 yo agradezco que la oposici n vaya entendiendo estos mecanismos que tratamos de ir mostrando con mucha tranquilidad agreg gullo en funci n de la din mica del congreso que tiene que estar no solo de puertas abiertas sino tambi n de debate abierto
4269707 tenemos que hacer un esfuerzo porque hay temas que son del conjunto de la sociedad y significan patrimonios hist ricos culturales que no podemos manejar con la rigidez de blanco o negro o si el oficialismo dice a yo digo z tiene que haber una apertura real
4269708 hoy es mucho m s rica la din mica pol tica de la argentina hay que convocar a la oposici n para que nos demos cuenta del bagaje que tenemos para consolidar instituciones y el protagonismo de toda la sociedad porque hay m s elementos de los que suponemos y m s posibilidades de hacer
4269709 pero tambi n hay que aprender mucho a adi el dirigente peronista hay que generar no solo ideas y proyectos sino tambi n una pr ctica af n con esas ideas y proyectos y obviamente brindarle a la democracia m s democracia a la gobernabilidad m s gobernabilidad
4269710 hay una agenda pol tica abierta la posibilidad de generar ideas y ser provocadores por la positiva en funci n de esas ideas
4269711 tambi n hay que adecuar algunas aristas que significan provocaciones negativas como ciertas tapas de diarios que quieren generar un clima de incertidumbre como el viernes negro donde parec a que se ca a la argentina y el lunes santo ya es un martes en que los guarismos son todos distintos a los del viernes

4269774 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia

4269788 our dog is good and vigilant but he is one dog and the wolves are many the wolves he catches are not always killed and the master judges and releases many to prey again upon us for no reason we can understand what can we do we are sheep but we do not wish to be food too
4269789 it is his teeth and claws that make the wolf so terrible to us it is his nature to prey and he would find any way to do it but it is the tools he wields that make it possible if we had such teeth we could fight back and stop this savagery
4269790 baaaaaaaadddd baaaaaddd things you have bad things we are afraid you are not sheep
4269791 we are still sheep but we do not wish to be food see our new teeth and claws protect us and have saved us from slaughter they do not make us into wolves they make us equal to the wolves and safe from their viciousness

4269828 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

4269830 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions

4269842 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4269843 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4269844 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4269845 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4269846 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4269847 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
4269848 if you are not 100 per cent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can
4269849 the win two weeks ago was satisfying but its easy to do one its about being able to back that performance up and thats what were trying to do

4269944 in addition to investing in innovation we must also reward innovators this means giving inventors the ability to obtain intellectual property protection for their innovations and to enforce these rights in the marketplace america is fortunate that our leaders recognize the importance of intellectual property rights and the need for these rights to be respected both at home and abroad i know i join many other americans in thanking this congress and this administration for their tireless efforts to promote intellectual property protection in this regard i would briefly note microsofts support for current efforts in congress to reform the u s patent system to meet the needs of the 21st century microsoft and other technology companies are working closely with chairman leahy and senator hatch on the senate judiciary committee and with the leadership of the house judiciary committee to advance legislation on needed reforms although i will not delve into the details here the reforms supported by microsoft and many others will improve patent quality reduce excessive litigation and promote international patent harmonization reforms that are vital if america is to retain its pre eminence in technology innovation

4269948 t he examiner bears the initial burden on review of the prior art or any other ground of presenting a prima facie case of unpatentability
4269949 in a vacuum but always in light of the teachings of the prior art and of the particular application disclosure as it would be interpreted by one possessing the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent art
4269950 analysis of whether the subject matter of a claim would have been obvious need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ
4269951 the motivation need not be found in the references sought to be combined but may be found in
4269952 d iscovery of an optimum value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art
4269953 having established that this knowledge was in the art the examiner could then properly rely as put forth by the solicitor on a conclusion of obviousness from common knowledge and
4269954 i t is proper to take into account not only specific teachings of the references but also
4269955 when the pto shows prima facie obviousness the burden then shifts to the applicant s to rebut
4269956 such rebuttal or argument can consist of a comparison of test data showing that the claimed compositions possess unexpectedly improved properties or properties that the prior art does not have
4269957 we build and create by bringing to the tangible and palpable reality around us new works based on instinct simple logic ordinary inferences extraordinary ideas and sometimes even genius these advances once part of our shared knowledge define a new threshold from which innovation starts once more and as progress beginning from ever higher levels of achievement is expected in the normal course the results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws were it otherwise patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts

4269969 there is a critical need to implement a network of fully protected marine reserves and sustainable fisheries management in order to help reverse the dramatic decline in the ecosystems of the north sea the sylt outer reef provides a perfect example of how we are failing to give our oceans the protection they require the area has been officially recognized as being an important site for a variety of marine life and warranting protection under european environmental law and yet destructive activities are still allowed in the area ensuring that the environmental and conservation objectives can never been achieved our action was intended to give real protection to the site that is currently a paper park the principle of non violence is core to greenpeaces ethos and is borne out by our long history of successful non violent direct action to protect the environment this principle of non violence is shepherded within greenpeace by sound science and judgment the fisherman were alerted to our presence and it was determined that the boulders would not be unsafe to vessels operating in the area the boulders however were big enough to serve as an effective obstacle to the beam trawlers that strip mine the ocean floor in the area this action is on par with the placing of similar obstacles to protect vital seagrass meadows as practiced in the mediterranean by protecting this area we have the opportunity to protect an ecosystem at its heart and publicly defend the need for an integrated marine management system that will allow sustainable fishing so that generations to come can enjoy the bounty of the seas sadly there appears to be a general denial by government and the fishing industry about the highly damaged state of the north sea and our oceans globally despite the mass of scientific evidence the fishing industry is a wholly owned subsidiary of the marine environment and urgent action is required if we are to prevent further collapses in stocks of commercially valuable fish and major ecosystem shifts please join us in protecting this area http members greenpeace org action start php action id 193 phil kline senior oceans campaigner greenpeace and former commercial fisherman

4269980 there is no man who does not wish to have peace for even they who make war desire nothing but victory desire that is to say to attain peace with glory and hence it is obvious that peace is the end sought for by war
4269981 and if an individual happen to be of such unrivalled strength and to be so jealous of partnership that he trusts himself with no comrades but makes his own plots and commits depredations and murders on his own account yet he maintains some shadow of peace with such persons as he is unable to kill and from whom he wishes to conceal his deeds
4269982 but let us suppose a man such as poetry and mythology speak of a man so insociable and savage as to be called rather a semi man than a man although then his kingdom was the shadow of his dreary cave and he himself was so singularly bad hearted that he was named cacus in book viii of the aeneid which is the greek word for bad though he had no wife to do his bidding no friend to enliven him with intercourse not even his father vulcan although he gave to no man but took as he wised whatever he could from whomsoever he could when he could yet in that solitary den the floor of which as virgil says was always reeking with recent slaughter there was nothing else but a peace that he sought a peace in which no one else could molest him he wished to be at peace with his own body and when the sedition of hunger with threatened to banish the soul from the body he made forays slew and devoured but used the ferocity and savageness he displayed in these actions only for the preservation of his own lifes peace if the appearance of his body and his vomiting smoky fires frightened men from having any dealings with him perhaps his fierce ways arose not from a desire to do mischief but from the necessity of finding a living it is better then to believe that such a man never existed and that this is mere fiction
