6970012 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6970013 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6970014 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6970031 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6970032 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6970033 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6970034 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6970035 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6970036 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

6970044 siempre se destaca cuando se habla de latinos qu separan al cubano y dicen el latino vota dem crata pero al cubano lo tienen identificado como otro tipo de hispano republicano recalcitrante conservador y eso se hab a cimentado con la posici n contra fidel castro antirrelaci n con cuba qu est pasando se han quedado con la historia pasada
6970045 dicen esperen un momentico me han estado enga ando con la pol tica republicana recalcitrante sobre cuba no ha pasado nada en cuba y mira la situaci n econ mica que tenemos aqu entonces lincoln d az balart y su hermano no se han dado cuenta de ese cambio y ah es donde vienen gente como yo como joe garc a y vamos a llevarle el mensaje a todos los votantes de los problemas aqu y no vamos a separar a los cubanos de los dem s porque a la larga todos sufrimos si llueve todos nos mojamos
6970046 han perdido poder en washington dentro de su propio partido porque no son respetados les dicen sus propios colegas que son unos payasos
6970047 una conspiraci n de la extrema izquierda para quitarlo del puesto
6970048 en el debate en miami siempre ha sido que cuando a uno no le va bien se levantan y dicen yo no debato m s contigo porque t eres comunista y se acaba el debate a m no me pueden decir eso yo vine aqu en 1960
6970049 tengo que ser fuerte en mi pa s para poder ayudar a otros no puedes ser bueno con m xico si est s pasando hambre aqu si un mexicano est aqu y tiene trabajo y gana buen dinero le manda m s dinero en remesas a su familia igual pasa aqu con los cubanos
6970050 nosotros como hispanos tenemos la responsabilidad de este pa s pero tambi n la responsabilidad emocional de donde venimos de donde nacimos
6970051 quisiera ayudar a la reconstrucci n a la democratizaci n de cuba pero la forma en que lo han llevado durante los ltimos 50 a os no ha funcionado entonces vamos hacer otra cosa vamos a crear una relaci n de familia a familia de amigo a amigo y vamos a fomentar esa comunicaci n para que ellos conozcan que es la libertad primero tenemos que tener contacto y eso de nada de contacto y decir que quien vaya all es comunista no lleva a nada
6970052 de esto de un triunfo m o es que lincoln tiene 53 a os yo tengo 59 vamos a ir con alguien poco mayor para abrirle camino luego a los j venes tienes alguien m s joven que yo pero que tiene una mentalidad totalmente cavern cola
6970053 viene un cambio significativo y yo quiero estar en la mesa
6970054 la pol tica hoy en d a est dise ada por una generaci n que fue v ctima de unos cr menes atroces de ese r gimen al empezar la revoluci n entonces la relaci n con cuba el nexo es emocional no pragm tico pero desde 1980 para adelante hay una diferencia enorme ya que los que han llegado despu s del 80 fueron victimas de vivir la revoluci n entonces a esos no les hacen cuentos sufrieron la falta de alimentos y toda cosa que ese r gimen hace padecer pero su relaci n con cuba es pragm tica pr ctica directa y real
6970055 desafortunadamente la pol tica hacia cuba es trabada est tica completamente
6970056 al mismo momento que bush ha cometido uno de sus errores torpes en pol tica exterior guiada totalmente por la comunidad cubana local por primera vez hizo lo que ning n otro presidente hab a logrado dividir la comunidad cubana y dividirla contra la posici n hist rica
6970057 ning n pol tico estadunidense ha dicho m s cosas negativas de fidel castro que bush a la vez ning n gobierno estadunidense ha hecho m s negocio con castro que el de bush cuando el papel en el que se imprime granma se manda desde estados unidos te das cuenta que esto ya s lo es m s un rito que una realidad
6970058 el embargo tiene un aspecto cuasi religioso uno cree en el embargo uno no puede probar que funciona porque despu s de 50 a os est bastante dif cil es m s religi n que pol tica porque la pol tica es algo que uno cambia para tener efecto c mo puedes anunciar que tenemos un embargo sobre cuba y ser el socio n mero uno de cuba en productos agr colas
6970059 parte del problema de algo est tico tanto tiempo es que la ceremonia empieza a tomar mas importancia que los hechos
6970060 desafortunadamente lo que ha sucedido es que nosotros queremos que la gente en cuba suene como mi abuela aqu y mi abuela no tiene vigencia en cuba
6970061 esos millones de d lares se han convertido en prebendas pol ticas en el exilio si los fondos eran para formar sociedades civiles en miami han sido muy eficaces
6970062 la pol tica hacia cuba es pol tica local simplemente con poco efecto en cuba
6970063 alguna gente utiliza la palabra intransigencia con orgullo aqu la ltima gran marcha se llam la marcha de la intransigencia la palabra di logo en miami no significa lo que en el resto del mundo en miami quiere decir someterse rendirse pero poco a poco eso se ha colapsado por no lograr su objetivo b sico y por la realidad de que la comunidad cubana est cambiando su relaci n con cuba
6970064 yo dirig a la organizaci n cubana m s grande fuera de cuba nunca he estado en cuba imag nate que la pol tica de estados unidos hacia m xico fuera programada por una persona que se fue de m xico en los a os 50 y ese fuera el experto sobre la realidad de tu pa s y que no ha regresado a m xico y que no tiene familia ah eso es lo que ha pasado con la pol tica hacia cuba la ret rica asusta a la gente por ser tan agresiva pero es la ret rica de unos fan ticos de un equipo de f tbol y griten lo que griten son impotentes ante el juego que en verdad est ocurriendo y cuanto m s impotente est s ante la realidad m s agresiva y absurda la ret rica
6970065 s tienen a n un poder enorme pero tambi n hay una comunidad que est cambiando a velocidad enorme en el distrito que estoy disputando contra mario los cubanos ahora son s lo la mitad de los latinos y el resto son de latinoam rica
6970066 indeed india made a big fuss about a paragraph the united states had inserted in the original text calling for indias eventual adherence to fullscope safeguards of the international atomic energy agency it succeeded in getting that paragraph removed before the text was circulated amongst nsg members
6970067 india can possibly live with the condition for a periodic review although even this will be difficult for prime minister manmohan singh to sell to the domestic political opposition but it will be well nigh impossible for india to accept the other two conditions
6970068 at this point we can expect that washington and new delhi will try to wordsmith the proposals to restrict and condition nuclear trade with india to the point of being meaningless and force a decision at the next nsg meeting in response responsible nsg states should insist on guidelines relating to india that are clear and unambiguous and given that the nsg participant states actions on this issue will have an impact for decades to come they should not rush to judgment
6970069 at a minimum the nsg must make clear that nuclear trade with india shall be terminated if it resumes testing for any reason if india cannot agree to such terms it suggests that india is not serious about its nuclear test moratorium pledge
6970070 the states which raised objections and moved amendments in vienna are likely to feel strengthened especially because eight of them have come together if they refuse to compromise by succumbing to u s pressure and indian embellishments they could succeed in blocking the deal

6970123 if you could spend one day with big bang what would you do
6970124 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6970125 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6970126 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6970127 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6970128 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6970129 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6970130 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6970131 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6970132 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6970133 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6970134 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6970135 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6970136 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6970137 as stewards of the history of mount prospect it is altogether fitting that we much like the ancients and in keeping with the earliest traditions of western civilization honor the accomplishments and traditions of the must sees of our time from this day forward
6970138 its gratifying to know that we live in a community that values its history and its institutions
6970139 i am very happy to be here to accept this honor on behalf of the 450 members of the church
6970140 im from chicago where the tradition is to vote early and often
6970141 seriously though this was such a clever idea for the historical society to hold this contest it was fun and hopefully people learned something about the village that they didnt know before they voted
6970142 the credit for keefers being one of the seven wonders goes to jerry and gerri
6970143 it all boils down to people liking to know who they are dealing with and if you are around long enough you get to know your customers
6970144 its not something you can package up it is the one on one service you get with a small town business
6970145 oh those are colour change btw so have fun matching them
6970146 i dont want to do anything it isnt a big deal
6970147 were not convinced all those noxious greenhouse gases are actually hurting the environment but even if we were convinced our hands are tied by our fealty to the american way by the leeway we have always given private organizations and local political entities to go their own way

6970154 dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself go forward and make your dreams come true
6970155 i took the road less traveled by and that has made all the difference
6970156 traffic is like a bad dog it isnt important to look both ways when crossing the street its more important to not show fear

6970160 an excellent source of information on both megalodons and great whites
6970161 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
6970162 we are extremely excited this week to be playing the minnesota vikings for a lot of reasons
6970163 there couldnt be a better team to play i think in the third preseason game than the vikings they are a very physical football team and thats not just from a reputation standpoint they have video evidence and statistical evidence to back that up they are no 1 in the league in running the football and no 1 in the league in stopping the run what a great measuring stick for us here this week with where we are in our development
6970164 were going out there and treating the preseason too much like the preseason
6970165 were going out there and thinking everything is just going to come when the regular season begins and were just out there playing snap for snap getting our timing and not playing up to the level were capable of playing at i dont feel thats ok
6970166 we didnt tackle well in the first preseason game and we didnt tackle well in the second preseason game it cant become a habit it cant become us i think the guys understand that and hopefully it will turn up in minnesota where we are tackling well
6970167 one thing is for certain if we do not tackle well they have a couple of backs no 28 adrian peterson and no 29 chester taylor who can go up and down the field on you we are certainly well aware of that
6970168 we will look at some of the division of labor that we focused on going in
6970169 even though they arent technical starters you will see rashard mendenhall play some lawrence timmons play some and so forth
6970170 right now justin is the one we are going with
6970171 we have a better idea of what sean mahan is capable of to get a fair evaluation of the two men at this time i think it is better to run justin with the first group
6970172 ill do it for free if you can give me one good reason for it
6970173 theres just so much more in life than just you
6970174 20 years of life about to be washed down a storm drain
6970175 nope im going to get me some of that viagra stuff
6970176 just think fifty years ago we were sitting here at this breakfast table together
6970177 we were probably sitting here naked as jaybirds fifty years ago
6970178 my nipples are as hot for you today as they were fifty years ago
6970179 ones in your coffee and the others in your oatmeal
6970180 i dont think you understand i want something very special
6970181 i know you need to make sure my check is good so ill write it now and you can call the bank monday to verify the funds and ill pick the ring up monday afternoon
6970182 hey mister why the heck is your head so small
6970183 boy if i wasnt so damn old id give you a beating but since you remind me of myself at your age i will tell you
6970184 one day i was fishing on the pier when i got a huge bite
6970185 but when i reeled it up to my surprise it was a gorgeous mermaid well she looked at me in tremendous fright and said shed grant me one wish if i let her free
6970186 if i had known you were actually going to get an erection i would have taken off my pantyhose
6970187 theyre a good defensive team theres no doubt about it but i dont think they play defensive football
6970188 theyll come up here maybe in mind to play counter attack but i just think theyre a solid defensive unit
6970189 to win games youve got to get forward you try and score goals so hopefully if they do try and come up here and win itll open things up for us
6970190 pace is always important but you dont have to be lightning quick in terms of playing at the back
6970191 some people say players lack pace but ill use tony popovic as an example
6970192 tonys never been quick but hes quick upstairs in terms of his thought process and his intelligence
6970193 i just like that in our side we do have a lot of pace and pace can sometimes get you out of trouble and then win you games
6970194 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
6970195 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
6970196 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
6970197 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health
6970198 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6970199 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6970200 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6970201 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6970202 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6970203 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6970204 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6970205 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6970206 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6970207 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
6970208 structural insights into the evolutionary paths of oxylipin biosynthetic enzymes
6970209 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6970210 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6970211 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6970212 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6970213 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6970214 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6970215 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6970216 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6970217 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6970218 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6970219 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6970220 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6970221 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6970222 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6970223 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6970224 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6970225 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6970226 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
6970227 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6970228 it underscored the prior concerns that he biden was a shallow vessel for other peoples ideas
6970229 i think i have a much higher iq than you do a bizarre videotaped putdown that biden immediately called into question with five 5 boasts about instapundit

6970232 the president has criticized those of us who have led the effort against his escalation as saying were emboldening the enemy
6970233 well let me tell you something mr president it is not the american people and joe biden and the united state senate that are emboldening the enemy its your failed policies that are emboldening the enemy
6970234 its the only mission this president has accomplished in iraq to embolden the enemy
6970235 all of us are going to be showing up all 800 of us
6970236 its going to determine in large part who the nominee is going to be
6970237 youre one of four contests right up front and i think the combination of those contests is going to determine the nominee
6970238 secondly nevada is a winnable state for democrats so youre going to see a lot of us

6970250 i have come to the end of my rope tell me what to do
6970251 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
6970252 when the holy ghost comes upon you you shall receive power to be my witnesses
6970253 for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
6970254 the lord is not slack according to his promise as some count slackness but is longsuffering toward us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance

6970261 somebody says youve got a likability problem and the point i was trying to make was i think thats silly
6970262 he said he was unable to gain altitude and was going down
6970263 theyre a good defensive team theres no doubt about it but i dont think they play defensive football
6970264 theyll come up here maybe in mind to play counter attack but i just think theyre a solid defensive unit
6970265 to win games youve got to get forward you try and score goals so hopefully if they do try and come up here and win itll open things up for us
6970266 pace is always important but you dont have to be lightning quick in terms of playing at the back
6970267 some people say players lack pace but ill use tony popovic as an example
6970268 tonys never been quick but hes quick upstairs in terms of his thought process and his intelligence
6970269 i just like that in our side we do have a lot of pace and pace can sometimes get you out of trouble and then win you games
6970270 we dont expect to do to spain what we did last time
6970271 its a brand new game were not an overconfident team but we are confident
6970272 but they jump higher they run faster theyre stronger youve got to play ugly and make them feel uncomfortable thats the only way
6970273 i dont know what the odds on us winning are
6970274 but for certain we wont repeat the game we had before
6970275 i feel younger now than i did a couple of years ago
6970276 they know theyve got to see me come october when the nba season begins

6970282 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
6970283 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see rodriguez
6970284 were very supportive of dr schiller and we will hear a variety of proposals about getting the sport reinstated there are no plans in place but we are very interested in remaining on this international platform
6970285 but baseball is such a big business in the united states
6970286 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6970287 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6970288 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have
6970289 basically the less money you have the less money you think you need to become rich the more money you have the more money you think you need
6970290 i think as you get more wealth you set the bar higher
6970291 to me someone who has a net worth of 10 million to 15 million probably doesnt have to work again as long as they dont go crazy
6970292 but most people who have a net worth of less than 15 million dont think of themselves as rich
6970293 but when i see 5 million i think wow thats going to be a great customer but i dont think whoo ee

6970345 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc

6970377 trades for a long time was one of those second class ideas because everybody wanted to send their kids to university now the trades dont have to be a second option if they cant afford university it might be one thing they could look at first
6970378 women have a history of multi tasking and they are really committed to their job the trades are a heck of a career right now not only in terms of benefits and wages but respect it has changed a lot in the past few years in terms of being considered a very valid career

6970383 this is likely to include growing operations in emerging markets such as china and india

6970402 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
6970403 the top capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 would return to 20
6970404 the tax rate on dividends would also be 20 for families making more than 250 000
6970405 the obama plan will realize tremendous savings within the health care system to help finance the plan the additional revenue needed to fund the up front investments in technology and to help people who cannot afford health insurance is more than covered by allowing the bush tax cuts to expire for people making more than 250 000 per year as they are scheduled to do
6970406 overall in an obama administration the top 1 of households people with an average income of 1 6 million per year would see their average federal income and payroll tax rate increase from 21 today to 24 less than the 25 these households would have paid under the tax laws of the late 1990s
6970407 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
6970408 the events of the past week will be remembered that way too
6970409 obviously it didnt happen at sydney i got injured athens just didnt go well at all
6970410 ive just got to hope my body can stand up and on august 24 i can run the best race of my life if i can do that im confident i can be in the top 10
6970411 in the olympics you never know if youve cooked yourself until the gun goes off and you think to yourself why am i so flat
6970412 in athens i felt like i was a car that had five gears and only four were working
6970413 my biggest priority has always been just trying to get to the start line in one piece
6970414 ive never really worried about doing all the other things you do as added extras because if you cant run then its pointless doing it
6970415 i havent spent 25 years of my life to bypass an olympic games
6970416 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6970417 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6970418 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6970419 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6970420 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6970421 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6970422 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6970423 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6970424 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6970425 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6970426 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6970427 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6970428 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6970429 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6970430 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6970431 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6970432 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6970433 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6970434 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6970435 de klacht heeft betrekking op het product iphone 3g en de verkoopspraktijk en het is aan de algemene directie om uit te maken wie hierin de verantwoordelijkheid draagt
6970436 voor ons is het immers niet duidelijk waar en in welke mate apple dan wel mobistar hier in de fout gaat
6970437 tell him there really is an afterlife tell him im doing just fine
6970438 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6970439 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6970440 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6970441 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6970442 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6970443 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6970444 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6970445 we dont plan on doing sth we plan to do it
6970446 my business is the best business and you would be a fool not to join it
6970447 we must help georgia rebuild that which has been destroyed that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
6970448 i joined with people like joe biden to increase a billion dollars of investment
6970449 its a good time to pick up an electronic voting machine on the cheap provided youre not a stickler for things like accuracy or security states are scrapping tens of thousands of pricey touchscreen systems in response to mounting concerns about the machines reliability
6970450 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6970451 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6970452 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6970453 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6970454 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6970455 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6970456 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6970457 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6970458 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6970459 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6970460 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6970461 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6970462 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6970463 an den aufnahmen grunds tzlich hindern kann man google indes nicht
6970464 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6970465 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6970466 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6970467 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6970468 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6970469 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6970470 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6970471 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6970472 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6970473 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6970474 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6970475 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6970476 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6970477 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6970478 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6970479 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6970480 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6970481 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6970482 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6970483 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6970484 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6970485 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6970486 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6970487 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6970488 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6970489 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6970490 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6970491 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6970492 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6970493 who are open to doing something on the production side
6970494 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6970495 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6970496 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6970497 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6970498 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6970499 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6970500 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6970501 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6970502 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6970503 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6970504 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6970505 id say its a watershed day for the province without a doubt
6970506 this is not only the hebron project itself but its the beginning of a sustainable industry here now rather than asking people to come home for one project we can say come home for a career and retire in newfoundland and labrador where you grew up
6970507 i think we have some wonderful abilities now to bring people home that we never had before
6970508 bring it on i have no problem with that weve been way too long not charging enough for our work companies like us are getting a pittance compared to what we should get and well get more money and be able to pass it on to our workers
6970509 we have the shore based facility at the st johns waterfront and naturally when the rig arrives to support hebron we will be servicing that operation and it will absolutely affect our operation we will have more activity more vessel activity
6970510 we wont be unlike a lot of companies there may be infrastructure changes equipment purchases et cetera and the more lead time you have to make good sound decisions the better off you are i think the next couple of years will go pretty quick
6970511 theres a great deal of economic development around this project well see very shortly people taking up more office space people moving in
6970512 research and development is very very important not only for academics and the university but also in terms of innovation with individual companies
6970513 if work from this hebron doesnt go there then work from somewhere else will have to
6970514 wayfarer your footsteps are the road and nothing more wayfarer there is no road the road is made by walking

6970535 la inseguridad no se soluciona con reuniones demag gicas como la de hoy
6970536 pura propaganda de pura demagogia y de pura fara malla
6970537 la inseguridad no se soluciona con un aumento del n mero de polic as y de soldados ni con amenazas de mano dura ni con leyes m s severas ni con penas m s largas tampoco con reuniones demag gicas como la de hoy del presidente pelele felipe calder n con los gobernadores y los titulares de las secretar as de seguridad p blica y de las procuradur as
6970538 calder n privilegia los asuntos que s lo arrojan privilegios a una minor a rapaz como las reformas a la seguridad social y la aprobaci n de nuevos impuestos que afectan a los peque os y medianos comerciantes y empresarios
6970539 pero todo es pura faramalla si en verdad quisiera el gobierno espurio enfrentar la crisis de seguridad deber a retirar de inmediato la iniciativa de reforma energ tica que es a todas luces privatizadora
6970540 el presidente pelele deber a otorgar apoyos a los j venes y garantizarles oportunidades de empleo y de educaci n as como entregar becas a aquellos que estudian el nivel medio superior
6970541 que obviamente no se plantear ni se abordar en la reuni n de este d a dijo calder n deber a soli citarle la renuncia a juan camilo mouri o porque la titularidad de la secretar a de gobernaci n que es la responsable de la conducci n de la pol tica interna no puede estar en manos de un delincuente confeso de la misma manera calder n tiene la obligaci n de separar de sus cargos al secretario de seguridad p blica federal genaro garc a luna y al procurador general de la rep blica eduardo medina mora porque ambos funcionarios ocuparon la direcci n de la agencia federal de investigaci n y del cisen en la administraci n foxista y desde ese entonces s lo han demostrado ser ineficientes y carecer de integridad
6970542 yo sostengo que el gobierno usurpador debe atender este asunto el de la inseguridad y de la violencia con seriedad porque nada m s se ha dedicado a la faramalla todo es pura propaganda y pura publicidad
6970543 pero siento que sacaron al ej rcito de sus cuarteles sin ninguna estrategia nada m s para hacer presencia porque no hay ning n plan
6970544 la situaci n de inseguridad que impera en todos los rincones de la naci n viene a confirmar que felipe calder n no existe que es un cero a la izquierda y que es un inepto

6970547 the result is a disgrace there were four chinese judges and they gave everything to their fighter and nothing to paddy i am pure raging
6970548 his effort was second to none and he scored points which werent awarded to him
6970549 he will overcome this and be back stronger hes got the mentality to go on to better things
6970550 words cant describe how proud of him i am but the way the fight was scored was disgusting and hard to watch
6970551 he was fighting one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world and he had a great chance
6970552 if he had got off to a better start things may have been different
6970553 it is a real shame he didnt score i thought there were at least four or five points which he should have got but he is coming home with the bronze medal and he has done
6970554 he is still our hero and we want to get him home there is a big party waiting for him
6970555 being in beijing was amazing the support for paddy was incredible
6970556 it was hard to see him so emotional after the fight but everyone saw that he did not stop he did not tire and he did not give up
6970557 i am disappointed that he didnt score but we are very pleased with the bronze
6970558 by the end of the fight he was going for the knock out because thats all he could hope for he showed the guts he has
6970559 paddy has competed in the biggest and the best sporting event in the world now it is all about
6970560 to get to the semi final of the olympics is a great achievement i thought he would have got to the final but the judges seemed slightly biased towards his opponent
6970561 it was hard to see him fight and watch no points go up on the board but he will come back stronger from the experience
6970562 he did well because he was fighting a champion boxer
6970563 i know nothing about boxing but i thought he should have had a few points he worked very hard these last years to get where he is
6970564 the abbreviated timeline and restrictive commenting options raise serious concerns that the department of the interior is attempting to rewrite a bedrock environmental statute without allowing for adequate public involvement
6970565 you mentioned on tim russert a couple of weeks ago that maybe the last time you ran and i am paraphrasing that you were maybe a little to arrogant maybe a little too confident
6970566 look i want to make it clear to you i dont think that im the guy diogenes found the only honest man thats not the case im making im not making the case that you know ill never tell a lie what im saying is that i promise you ill tell you what i think i promise you i promise you i will tell you what i think is needed and ill make the case for it this is because some things are worth losing an election over
6970567 this is the key difference between 22 years ago and today
6970568 today i know exactly why i want to be president im not saying i know im right about everything but i know why i want to be president i know what i will try to do the difference between then and now is an easy call that vote was worth losing an election over
6970569 i respect the fact that you thought that vote was in support of the war and that i shouldnt have done it but as long as there is one single solitary soldier in harms way that i know i can protect that i know i can materially increase their chance of surviving i will do it
6970570 i also reject categorically the notion that there are fundamental lines of division based on ideology that separate this country it is not true
6970571 the country is neither liberal conservative or centrist but rather its pragmatic the american people are looking for pragmatic solutions to concrete problems they face every day
6970572 im very proud of my service with the national guard and proud to be associated with the men and women who serve in our military
6970573 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6970574 its a little challenging in that im always changing hats
6970575 im grading papers in the car between campaign stops its a little hard to transition some of the time but life is never dull
6970576 actually this time we went to joe and asked him to run
6970577 after bush won again i was flabbergasted i mean i didnt know anybody at all who voted for bush i just didnt think he could win again i was so disappointed in the fact that john kerry didnt win and that bushs policies were going to continue
6970578 we talked as a family before joe even knew about it and we went to joe two years ago and said we think you are the only one that can pull together the red states and the blue states and build consensus on issues that are important we think you should run and he did
6970579 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs

6970585 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter

6970590 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6970591 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6970592 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6970593 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6970594 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6970595 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6970596 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6970597 hell be a student assistant coach a position that is still evolving here at the university
6970598 hell have sessions with fellow student athletes during and after practices and on occasion attend coaches meetings and plan and coordinate practices i will not put him in a position to critique fellow players but i do want him to listen in and learn the process and maybe a few years down the road hell be able to offer opinion
6970599 tampa bay co owner oren koules called and told me i worked too hard in my life to not get drafted and he just said to worry about staying healthy

6970605 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long

6970607 if your costs of owning an asset are much higher than your cost of leasing that asset then the taxpayers are every property is different and any disposition of property would require public input and local government approval huber said
6970608 this administration has talked a lot about increasing ethics and the need for transparency and to ensure citizens decisions are being made on their merit but they really have been glaringly inconsistent in walking the walk
6970609 this is one of those cases from start to finish it doesnt pass the smell test
6970610 despite the significant costs associated with this exercise we have agreed to perform this function at no cost to the tax payers
6970611 theres always this presumption of impropriety of a smoke filled clandestine room where people go to make the real deal
6970612 i dont know that its always so evil and awful john spent a long time building relationships with these people and getting to know them
6970613 if you call on a piece of property will he return your call will he tell you what the status is and for what price thats the test
6970614 i will tell you any broker will tell you thats not the way it happens what happens is he goes out and finds somebody to buy it that he wants to do business with
6970615 john is very good at leveraging his political contacts into work with his firm but that doesnt necessarily mean venture has the resources to competently do the work
6970616 every interest in identifying as much property to sell off as they can because thats how they get paid
6970617 its a foregone conclusion youre going to come up with some property to sell

6970619 what the hell i have a bit so i will make a bar top

6970627 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art
6970628 some time ago i was speaking to a billionaire from italy who found an indian artist featured in one of the catalogues of a global auction
6970629 he said indian art was so inexpensive if he had to purchase similar work by an american artist he would have to purchase it for 1 million whereas he would be able to buy similar quality art for 50 000 from an indian artist
6970630 the economy has changed anyone can buy indian art be it a sheikh from dubai or collector from hong kong one does not go to the west to validate it
6970631 those were the times when our country was battling several issues and there was no one to validate art but not any more

6970663 15 15 kilometers ive never run that far in my life
6970664 thank you constable rundle thank you so much you have no idea how happy i am to see you
6970665 come the others are back at camp we managed to recover and repair most of our things and they should have it struck by now
6970666 we have liaised closely with our colleagues in suffolk to review all the information regarding steve wright and our outstanding cases including the investigations into the deaths of michelle bettles natalie pearman and the disappearance of kellie pratt
6970667 at this time no links have been found clearly if any further information comes to light and it is appropriate we will re examine our files
6970668 our investigations remain live inquiries and we always welcome any new information from members of the public in relation to any of these matters
6970669 there has got to be a possibility because of his lifestyle and the details that came out in the case
6970670 as far as im aware norfolk police havent interviewed him so i dont know how they can rule him out
6970671 i have had absolutely zero communication from them in the last 12 months i had one call to say a cold case team had been set up and that was it i am totally disgruntled with the police
6970672 theres no link as far as i know at the moment
6970673 the police have told me that and i have no reason to doubt them
6970674 i dont make links weve had so many false hopes over the years that i tend to blank it out suffolk homes
6970675 we have been against the appointment from the start and boycotted the process
6970676 here is the county council cutting services putting up charges and paying staff what the public sees as vast sums of money
6970677 the pay scale is complicit with the previous occupant of the post and we have not altered it it is not an increase the band is exactly the same
6970678 im delighted we have been able to appoint such an outstanding candidate she very much impressed the panel not least because of her experience in running the communications department in britains third largest city as well as at the local government information unit in london
6970679 there are major challenges facing local government in suffolk over the next few years and caryl is exceptionally well qualified to explain to residents how we will continue to provide excellent services to local people
6970680 i think learning from the experience of the chief executive they were very careful with the process
6970681 there was no last minute salary changes or bidding and this salary was within the banding set
6970682 i am pleased they learned their lesson and i am happy to agree she ms jackson was the best candidate for the post
6970683 i am flattered and delighted to be offered this great privilege to work on behalf of the people of this lovely county
6970684 because suffolks local government structures are likely to change significantly there is a massive job of work to do to engage people in the consequent changes that will affect all our lives suffolk homes
6970685 i live here and it would probably do me more harm than good
6970686 i want the neighborhood to be our customers after they came over and expressed their concern i dropped it

6970693 around one in seven couples could be affected by infertility
6970694 the implications can be devastating for some sometimes with unseen consequences for mental health and wellbeing we are potentially offering a big improvement in the lives of many couples in the region where ivf is clinically the right solution and has the potential to succeed
6970695 however the treatment may not be the right answer for every couple it involves a complex programme that can take up to a year and it is important that there are limitations where there may be clinical or other risks
6970696 part of the treatment involves specialist counselling so that couples have all the information and support that they need
6970697 couples will be tremendously excited about this news it has been very frustrating for people who cannot afford the big costs of going through private treatment if their one cycle with the nhs had not worked for them leaving them worrying if they would ever have a child
6970698 this will transform many lives and will roughly treble their chances through the nhs
6970699 this new policy is the result of an extremely successful collaboration of clinical experts nhs managers and patients that will ensure a much fairer approach across the region
6970700 i have been very impressed with the thoroughness of the approach by the east of england specialised commissioning group especially with their understanding of infertility their recognition that the inequity within the region was unacceptable and their recognition of infertility as something deserving of nhs funding
6970701 police have arrested a 32 year old woman from felixstowe on suspicion of engaging in a sexual act in the presence of an under 16 year old and a 38 year old man from felixstowe has been arrested on suspicion of rape
6970702 this relates to historic allegations dating back several years which are being investigated by police both have been bailed to return to ipswich police station on october 14
6970703 we can confirm that two members of staff in the fire service have been suspended
6970704 this is a police matter and therefore we cannot comment in any detail suffolk homes
6970705 there has been a narrowing down of differences between the various countries it is quite a remarkable feat that 45 different sovereign nations should decide to have one point of view over any issue

6970709 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6970710 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6970711 taking some time off isnt always the easiest thing to do but i feel like im able to do it ok and not lose my swing by taking days off
6970712 one thing i talked about before the game is we cant do two things walk people and commit errors because of their propensity to hit home runs
6970713 we got away with it tonight but you cant expect to do that all the time we were fortunate
6970714 in the second or third inning i told the guys tonight was the epitome of being effectively wild
6970715 i was getting away with some stuff i was missing my spots
6970716 thats kind of a weird feeling about the situation here in chicago
6970717 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox

6970720 from the size of the preserved bones we estimated that omo i was tall and slender most likely around 510
6970721 taken together the remains show that these early modern humans were much like the people in southern ethiopia and the southern sudan today
6970722 most of the anatomical features of omo are like modern humans only a few features are similar to more primitive hominids including neanderthals and homo erectus
6970723 omo ii is more primitive in its cranial anatomy and shares more features with homo erectus and fewer with modern humans
6970724 when such cases verbal abuse are reported we can only forward it to the education department for further action
6970725 however it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court
6970726 despite the reports the teachers who allegedly abused the indian students verbally and physically continue to teach and no apparent action has been taken against them

6970738 think about it if no one who ever could do taught then the bulk of our educational system would be gone think of all the college professors who are experts in their fields who both do and teach if no one who ever could do shared what they do no one would ever learn the doing

6970750 we have been seeing about 30 cases of cancer of the cervix per year and that has been constant now
6970751 arcisil prevents the development of the precursors to cervical cancer in other words it prevents women from developing cervical cancer it immunises her against the human papiloma virus
6970752 the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown
6970753 the real impact of hpv vaccination on cervical cancer will not be observable for decades
6970754 we must be certain that spending an estimated 2 billion to vaccinate a population of girls and women in canada who are already mostly well protected by their own immune systems safer sex practices and existing screening programs will not perpetuate the existing gaps in care and leave the actual rate of deaths from cervical cancer unchanged

6970762 the on ice stuff is pretty impressive when you consider how much ice time stajan gets
6970763 i was nervous i can tell you that i had never played over there in the minor leagues hadnt played over there at all in the big leagues i was just trying to find a way to get in a comfort zone so i could let my ability just take over and let my instinct take over
6970764 my only thought was just to try to make sure i catch the ball the glove ive been trying to work it in as fast as possible its kind of deep in the back of my mind about that and trying to make sure i catch everything
6970765 i looked at the play where he threw to second and it wasnt that bad
6970766 one thing we havent been able to work on is that play he had thursday night i told him when i sent him out there that there might be a pickoff play so be ready he was ready but the throw was a little low
6970767 on another day i think betancourt would have handled that throw and the guy would have been out
6970768 i think everybody says its one of the easiest positions
6970769 my mentality as a baseball player is whatever you ask me ill do it its like the same thing when i got injured from diving suffering a season ending broken thumb in 2006 they said would you dive again id probably say i would have done it on the first play
6970770 if you put me in at first in the ninth in a one run game id do it again thats the kind of player that i feel like i need to be
6970771 there would be enough time for him to get four or five starts up here in september
6970772 physically he could come up here and start but the quality of hitters is a factor
6970773 if he threw 4 2 3 innings thursday night and threw 70 75 pitches that might translate up here to three innings depending on who you are playing quality of major league hitters make the starter throw a lot of pitches add to it a young power pitcher and they can foul off a lot of pitches and take a lot of pitches
6970774 the danger of it is i dont want to mess with raul
6970775 he has been so good i dont want to toy with him too much but he is such a pro that wherever he hits he will give you his best effort and it wont get in his head
6970776 during the interviews every bone in my body wanted to ask follow up questions
6970777 i could have gone 30 minutes on each question instead i just bit my tongue and asked the primary questions and ignored my follow up questions id written down and ones i was dying to ask in that moment
6970778 i hope you enjoyed the forum i wanted to prove that voters could learn more about the candidates through a civil discussion than through an antagonistic debate i also wanted to challenge the goofy caricature that many people have about evangelicals
6970779 may god bless you in your work i have no intention of leaving my day job in fact im leaving the country during the two weeks of the conventions so i wont have to comment on anything ill be back in africa including teaching a full day seminar on reconciliation to the parliament of kenya thanks again

6970781 engage them and show that you love them before you show verses
6970782 the third step for christians to take is to be barnabases according to azumah who said that personal testimonies are more powerful when people know the one involved
6970783 he used the story of the samaritan woman recorded in john 4 as a case in point noting that the bible records how many of the samaritans from the town believed in him jesus because of the womans testimony john 4 39
6970784 samaritans azumah said were to jews as muslims are to christians
6970785 you might have the resources you might have enthusiasm and all the knowledge but wait for the holy spirit to come to you
6970786 first pray for ourselves for a heart for muslims second pray for christian minorities in the islamic world third pray that god may open up the muslim world for the gospel finally pray for individual ordinary muslims wherever they may be
6970787 many muslims come to jesus christ through visions and dreams
6970788 if we pray with muslims as our prayer topic the holy spirit will go

6970805 i posted my basement suite on craigslist tuesday at about 2 p m its on okay suite not the worst but not the fanciest im not one of those homeowners whos raised the house to create higher ceilings its about 540 square feet and the stove is at least 15years old i charge 650 which i thought was reasonable and in the ballpark for the part of mount pleasant i live in the calls started coming in at about 2 01 p m after the first 10 calls in half an hour that effectively prevented me from getting any work done i put a message on my machine telling people to send me emails instead by 9 that night i pulled the ad off craigslist because even the emails were overwhelming me in all id say ive had almost 100 calls some from the newspaper ad that i couldnt get pulled for a day one young guy offered me 100 over whatever anyone else was willing to pay so that he and his girlfriend could get out of the 340 square foot basement hole they were in on fraser street one couple described themselves as professionals in their early 30s who were dying to get out of their bachelor apartment on a busy intersection nearby people who worked at galleries in publishing at talent agencies called so did lots of graduate students and then slow off the mark towards the tail end of the 100 calls so did lots of men with the accents of various locales around the world and this was all happening in the middle of the month not at the beginning when presumably most of the vacant apartments had already changed hands the whole experience was actually scary i felt like the helicopter pilot in the evacuation of saigon someone whose whimsical choices about which of the supplicants i would call back would alter their lives it made me feel like going out and buying an apartment building just so i could rent it out to all the desperate and very nice people who called and emailed

6970819 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6970820 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president

6970837 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6970838 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6970839 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
6970840 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
6970841 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6970842 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6970843 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

6970906 weve had our strongest applicant pool in the past five years
6970907 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year
6970908 its only going to be a short amount of time before a new budget gets through and the congress is committed to moving peace corps in an upward direction
6970909 it is my goal to see a growing number of highly qualified diverse and determined americans of all ages committing themselves to serve our country as peace corps volunteers
6970910 achieving this goal will require a strong nationwide recruiting presence
6970911 i worry about what the budgetary implications are for the next president who we anticipate will have plans to expand peace corps
6970912 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska the hospital shall promptly contact appropriate authorities to take custody of the child
6970913 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6970914 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6970915 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6970916 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6970917 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6970918 the intrusiveness of a body cavity search cannot be overstated
6970919 to justify such a dehumanizing and humiliating invasion of privacy there must be some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify the specific individuals eligible for a strip search and the interest in preventing the introduction of contraband
6970920 when youre coaching these guys its not that you dont do it with your own college or pro teams you need to be on top of your game all the time because they deserve that
6970921 in a constant state of preparation and never feels like hes completely prepared
6970922 i feel like weve been through the wars together for years and whatever were facing whether its a tough year with the team or the ncaa tournament or whatever i recognize him and i know where hes at
6970923 he is different for this i think he feels so much responsibility that it goes beyond a tournament or winning a game or even a gold medal i have had to stand back and try to get a grip on whats going on
6970924 there is a similarity to when he was a young coach
6970925 but i dont think he has ever felt this sense of responsibility even then he feels hes carrying an amazing load
6970926 the reason is those kinds of signs may encourage or give children or parents a false sense of security
6970927 i love n c state football and i love this team
6970928 i love my teammates and i love this university so im really going to do anything i can to help this team win

6970930 but its like it becomes a second nature to him hes at home hes comfortable
6970931 but i guess they chose him because they think hes the best quarterback to help them win
6970932 were in a totally different situation not in a one horse show
6970933 they simmons and lindsay know how to do all the little things the right way make the adjustments holtz said
6970934 its not just knowing what to do its knowing how to do it when the defense changes those guys understand the whole scheme
6970935 its about being patient waiting for things to open up using your blockers and speed
6970936 i dont need to answer that you guys know that answer i am the best

6970971 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
6970972 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6970973 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20 billion id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer
6970974 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6970982 world aint what it seems is it gunny you keep that in mind the moment you think you got it figured youre wrong
6970983 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
6970984 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see rodriguez
6970985 were very supportive of dr schiller and we will hear a variety of proposals about getting the sport reinstated there are no plans in place but we are very interested in remaining on this international platform
6970986 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues or of being called up arent allowed to come
6970987 i think thatd be great but thats a decision major league baseball would have to make and now that we have the world baseball classic i dont see that
6970988 its a tremendous benefit for the defense especially with spygate and all that stuff
6970989 it helps us and it protects us to where you know a team cant steal your signals
6970990 but you know me im a little stubborn i dont prefer it
6970991 the big thing for lofa he really doesnt like to have anybody in his ear on game day
6970992 so for the first couple of times ive just tried to give him the call and let him get used to it
6970993 i was telling them to hurry up because that thing is going to shut off
6970994 if you rely too much on the receiver and kind of get away from the hand signals i could definitely see it being a problem
6970995 so we still sneak in some hand signals now and then
6970996 you get a little tight back or wake up funny or you tweak it whatever
6970997 you just have to let it calm down a little bit
6970998 hes much better today as i said wednesday hes got to be ready to play in the sept 7 regular season opener

6971009 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6971010 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6971011 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else

6971013 ive always had a dream to play on this team thankfully the opportunity to play with the team is here were going to try to do things right and try 100 percent to stay here
6971014 we all like him at second but i think he can play third
6971015 and well find out if he can play shortstop it will probably be at home it will probably be midweek at home but well find out

6971196 more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities
6971197 we have a system that locks away too many young first time nonviolent offenders for the better part of their lives

6971199 we have certain sentences that are based less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from

6971201 the race of criminals reported by crime victims matches arrest data
6971202 its going to take a lot more than 5 000 or so federal crack defendants a year to account for the 562 000 black prisoners in state and federal facilities at the end of 2006 or the 858 000 black prisoners in custody overall if one includes the population of county and city jails
6971203 the typical criminal commits from 12 to 16 crimes a year not counting drug offenses

6971223 the search for unpolluted drinking water is as old as civilization itself as soon as there were mass human settlements waterborne diseases like dysentery became a crucial population bottleneck for much of human history the solution to this chronic public health issue was not purifying the water supply the solution was to drink alcohol
6971224 dying of cirrhosis of the liver in your forties was better than dying of dysentery in your twenties
6971225 is made up of descendants of those early beer drinkers and we have largely inherited their genetic tolerance for alcohol

6971234 there is a short term special off peak promo going on for delhi to mumbai and mumbai to delhi only these sectors have had very light loads during the last few weeks it is good news for passengers
6971235 however average loads for low cost carriers in the mumbai delhi sector dropped even further to around 40 per cent
6971236 on the delhi mumbai route full service carriers are usually immune to the price sensitive market because most of their travellers are corporate so while the higher fares did not affect the loads of the full service carriers low cost carriers took a major hit
6971237 out of 54 daily flights between delhi and mumbai around 35 are operated by full service carriers which means low cost carriers do not have much capacity anyway so cutting back was out of the question
6971238 it also helped that goair started the zero rupee fares very early in july when the airlines saw that all the passengers were filling up goair flights they had to follow suit

6971246 to win games youve got to get forward you try and score goals so hopefully if they do try and come up here and win itll open things up for us
6971247 pace is always important but you dont have to be lightning quick in terms of playing at the back
6971248 some people say players lack pace but ill use tony popovic as an example
6971249 tonys never been quick but hes quick upstairs in terms of his thought process and his intelligence
6971250 i just like that in our side we do have a lot of pace and pace can sometimes get you out of trouble and then win you games
6971251 the only time id ever been fishing was once or twice when i was 8 with my grandfather

6971253 its not interesting i wanted a young female who was interested in the outdoors to teach her to be an expert fisherman
6971254 whitneys got such a personality that i think its going to be really good
6971255 i went from not fishing ever to fishing for sharks in key west
6971256 the most difficult juggling act is getting access to whitney
6971257 were kind of operating on a wing and a prayer when shes available we grab her
6971258 its taken me to so many places ive never been before
6971259 shes fantastic her personality just shines when the camera comes on
6971260 i can put her in front of the camera and give her a script and its magic
6971261 fish are kind of smart they will not bite if they dont think its a fish they can eat
6971262 each fish is different you have to fool them in a different way
6971263 she is just so peppy and so up that when the captains are talking to her shes just real inquisitive
6971264 in my lifetime of fishing theres an awful lot of men who invest an awful lot of money but at the end of the day dont come home with fish
6971265 we saw a huge dorsal fin of a hammerhead shark that was 700 to 800 pounds
6971266 we spun circles around the water to make it muddy so the shark couldnt get the tarpon
6971267 it was really cool but i almost cried because i didnt want the tarpon to get hurt
6971268 you hold them up take a picture and throw them back
6971269 i try to go whenever i can its very very thrilling its a wonderful workout
6971270 shes just such a little athlete shes like a little natural
6971271 she just catches on so quick to any kind of athletic thing
6971272 when you get a good fish on the line its a workout
6971273 no is not in her vocabulary you tell her this is what we want you to do she will find a way to do it
6971274 its been really fun watching her you feel like you are the one doing the fishing
6971275 she was on a trach tube very early after her stroke and one of the things they were to do would be to suction that trach tube
6971276 it is our belief that if she had received the care the tracheotomy care that they were told that she would receive that she would not have suffered respiratory arrest
6971277 representations and concealments are deceptive misleading and made with the intent to induce elderly citizens to become residents at extendicares facilities under a false pretense namely that extendicare will provide nursing care consistent with their representations
6971278 after what i saw thats the last place on gods earth id want to be put
6971279 on behalf of our daughter i think were fighting our damnedest to try and make sure this doesnt happen to other people
6971280 the late late radio show with tom snyder amp steve mason
6971281 few tools have done as much to break the wall of arab ignorance and lack of accountability as al jazeera debates that were previously thought unimaginable in the arab world are now heatedly discussed night after night and broadcast to tens of millions the impact of this development cannot be overstated
6971282 i have no clue and i dont want to know

6971284 nineteen of the 32 victims of the virginia tech massacre were over the age of 21
6971285 done nothing or very little to address this issue since the virginia tech massacre
6971286 were our security measures re evaluated in the wake of virginia tech absolutely
6971287 but not just because of virginia tech we looked at things after columbine that was frankly a game changer we now have rapid emergency deployment we dont wait for swat the first officers on the scene form an ad hoc response team and go in
6971288 we can usually be any place on campus in under a couple of minutes or less

6971291 he plays with me and loves me and i miss him a lot
6971292 every since cassidy her other dog died hes been my best friend
6971293 this fellow was wandering on the road and could have been hit
6971294 i feel for the family but im still concerned for the dogs safety
6971295 the dog is already gone and the man who adopted it doesnt want to release it so what can we do
6971296 what if someone in that crowd had said thats my dog
6971297 maybe its the wrong dog maybe theyre barking up the wrong tree
6971298 he was found one street away at almost the same address hes our dog
6971299 this is my first year in 4 h i take sewing projects

6971305 tiada sesuatu yang membuat kami seperti ini selain rasa cinta yang telah mengharu biru hati kami menguasai perasaan kami memeras habis air mata kami dan mencabut rasa ingin tidur dari pelupuk mata kami betapa berat rasa di hati ketika kami menyaksikan bencana yang mencabik cabik bangsa ini sementara kita hanya menyerah pada kehinaan dan pasrah oleh keputusasaan

6971378 obama has the judgment he has the intellect which no one doubts and i guarantee you he has the steel in his spine to lead this country of ours out of the deep hole we have dug ourselves into

6971474 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany of peaceful coexistence among warring sects ive seen zero evidence of that

6971482 god who gave us life gave us liberty can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
6971483 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them
6971484 inertia is the resistance an object has to a change in its state of motion
6971485 3 versus 0 02 isnt too much difference i guess
6971486 that inexperience is a good thing for us theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6971487 we saw that in our first match against the all blacks a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches

6971489 the environment this year is one thats a little bit more relaxed and about backing yourself
6971490 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6971491 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6971492 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6971493 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6971494 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6971495 please say something 1 15 just won best animation at the festival
6971496 the maoist party has received only a limited and not a full mandate
6971497 on the basis of that mandate it has been able to form the government but it has to work with coalition partners and cannot go on its own
6971498 there were really masses of amendments and suggestions absorbed at this meeting many of the delegations said the same thing in different words
6971499 timing is still a concern of course because of the congressional calendar
6971500 we want to see this process move as quickly as possible

6971502 at some stage there was child trafficking involved prior to them coming into contact with the agency involved in india

6971504 two rocks fell on each side of the boys and that kind of supported the weight around them
6971505 they were able to talk to each other and hold each others hands

6971511 we probably will see sheetflow in the north fort myers area as that water starts to run down from charlotte county
6971512 the more rain you get the more flooding youll have
6971513 if people need to get out we will help them evacuate but they need to call us
6971514 this wont be over for a couple of days so its important that we pace ourselves
6971515 it could hold tropical storm strength all along the panhandle
6971516 we could be dealing with hurricane gustav next week in the caribbean
6971517 wow that is high especially with gas prices theyre so high already and theyre going to raise up the tax prices no
6971518 its like throwing a drowning person a cinder block instead of a life preserver
6971519 its not a question of rich versus poor its a question of what in the short term is a more stable source of revenue to help get us through to better times
6971520 a sales tax or any kind of tax increase is going to hurt people in the pocketbook on the other hand if we dont do something to increase taxes were going to have to cut programs that hurt those very same people hardest
6971521 the launch of these three new blogs clearly makes mediabistro com a central source for daily news in the rapidly growing mobile sector
6971522 we will continue to add content and services for the mobile community over the coming months
6971523 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6971524 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6971525 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6971526 our goal from the outset has been to fairly compensate people harmed by this tragedy
6971527 we deeply regret what occurred and are working hard to become an industry leader in the areas of personal and process safety
6971528 bps claims of good intentions and promises of future compliance are simply not reliable

6971548 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically

6971606 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6971607 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6971608 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6971609 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement

6971614 immigration judges should have the tools necessary to control their courtrooms and protect the adjudicatory system from fraud and abuse
6971615 this proposed rule seeks to preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings
6971616 prejudicial to the administration of justice or undermines the integrity
6971617 the simple fact of focusing on ethical issues is a step in the right direction

6971631 alberto jim nez tampoco ha hecho caso alega que no nos puede dar los programas de desarrollo rural porque no hay recursos alega que no se nos pueden dar paquetes de chivos porque all en la zona de la mixteca ya no hay campo para que se puedan alimentar yo creo que eso es una burla una ofensa para la gente
6971632 yo creo que ellos como secretarios deber an ver la forma para resolver estos problemas tan lacerantes la gente tiene muchas necesidades sin embargo estas secretar as tienen alguna forma para hacer que no se sienta tanto la pobreza en el estado
6971633 han hecho en este a o y medio muchas promesas se han comprometido a muchas cosas y no nos han hecho nada ellos alegan muchas cosas que no les han dado recursos que no tienen recursos pero la realidad es que est n en campa a

6971644 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6971645 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6971646 i saw that announcement we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6971647 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor
6971648 we will turn our attention to providing the assistance that georgia needs to rebuild its infrastructure provide humanitarian relief aid its damaged military and help shore up its currency

6971669 dont feel you have to give but if you do give from the heart
6971670 last year we were fortunate to come out with that win there
6971671 i thought we played pretty good we just couldnt put it in last year and obviously were doing a much better job of that this year
6971672 this is what the seasons about and we wanted to make him proud this game
6971673 we kind of had some mental errors there at the end of the half and let them score 14 but we redeemed it and got back at it
6971674 we were down 28 0 and we make it a 28 14 ballgame and have got them on the ropes
6971675 if wed had another two minutes in the second quarter it might have been a 28 21 ballgame at the half its one of those things where we just ran out of time there at the end of the first half but tas a big old physical football team and they just beat us into submission i guess you could say
6971676 you could be right got time for a cup of tea
6971677 the focus in the mortgage market is now on availability more than anything else with financially strong and experienced lenders the most likely to offer credit in addition there are a number of dedicated specialist lenders with strong pedigree who may be able to help meet borrowers needs

6971689 how about if obama and biden come together from the denver convention and make a stop in santa fe we are the closest swing state to colorado and obama has yet to visit the north post convention might be an ideal time
6971690 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6971691 the linebackers defensive ends everybody played well especially in the second half
6971692 in the first half though we werent hitting on all cylinders offensively but we started to click in the second half but the defense played big the whole way
6971693 we had some new guys on the offensive line but they stepped right up and played just like we left off last year
6971694 because of all of the early season errors and then we decided to turn it into a war documentary in the second half
6971695 a game like this tells you a lot about our players and they responded well to adversity against a good football team in clayton
6971696 we made a lot of mistakes you cant turn the ball over four times and sanderson played real hard
6971697 but the thing we have to build on is our kids didnt quit we stayed with it for the full 48 minutes of play
6971698 we came out here with a chip on our shoulder
6971699 we had something to prove to show that he was still with us
6971700 after my first touchdown i hit the side of my helmet and pointed up to the sky
6971701 atlas may be gone but i wanted everyone to know that he is still with us in spirit
6971702 for these players i think its very important to bring success back to this community the storied program that northern is there is no reason that we shouldnt have success and fun like we did tonight
6971703 i thought both teams played well considering this was only the third game of the season
6971704 but the most important part of the season is yet to come for us
6971705 its good to have a couple of hard fought games early in the season like that
6971706 he stopped turned around and theres the alley right there go get it
6971707 it is nice in the first game of the season to be that explosive
6971708 the great thing about it is so many running backs got their hands on it and did good things when they got it
6971709 the defense played exceptionally well except for that fake punt
6971710 they are both veterans and it is expected of them because they are both great backs
6971711 they are both explosive and can score at any time
6971712 how nasty is thumbing down adoptive parents for listing their family and circumstances that brought them to adopt

6971716 shes grown a lot this time and taken a major step to win a stakes race in adelaide to this one here because there was some good form in this race
6971717 shes a competitor and she loves the valley so well probably keep her here for that champagne in about a months time
6971718 shes a very powerfully built filly and theres a lot of stakes races at 1200
6971719 we were going through the nominations on monday and we had von costa de hero which was pretty exciting
6971720 david said dont worry about that youve got a very good filly in the other race
6971721 one army soldier from the first infantry division who was escorting the politician was among those killed there is an ongoing investigation into the incident
6971722 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
6971723 but who has pushed me the most brandon johnson because he aint going to let no freshman take his spot

6971750 if i were president i would convene an asia energy summit with china india japan the world bank the asian development bank and the united nations environment program to adopt a ten year strategy for a major energy transition in asia
6971751 that doesnt imply an effort to oppose chinas emergence as an influential power but it does mean maintaining our military presence pdf in east asia strengthening our alliance with japan and our relations with other asian countries and working through groups like the apec forum to further american interests and values

6971772 the government accepts that our policies must evolve to remain relevant in the current media landscape it is no longer realistic to disallow all forms of party political films

6971780 his death is a great loss to the armed forces and the government but i know he did not die in vain we are continuing what he fought for
6971781 he got along well with his troops and led them in achieving their work and mission
6971782 he was so frugal and did not want any extravagance
6971783 he always encouraged us and trained the children to only spend for the essentials and not for what they want
6971784 he told our kids that shoes did not make students excel or do good in school but hard work and intelligence did
6971785 he did not want to break the trust of our children so he would make sure to fulfill whatever commitment he made

6971789 is there something radically wrong with the education and culture of our young men and women that they should not know the answers to these reasonable questions or is it that i have become a monomaniac and am therefore unable to perceive how unfair my questions are

6971798 i dont want them here and i am sure that the majority of the sunshine coast community probably dont want them here and whilst we cant prevent them from coming we will do everything we can to make it uncomfortable for them and will be watching their activities very closely

6971805 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design

6971818 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to obtain that objective
6971819 but likely mostly so with companies or in categories most tied to track and field when you combine his most recent performance with the high profile scandals in the sport the result is a less compelling spokesperson
6971820 when you look at the lifespan of a professional athlete its growing longer because its starting younger and i think thats motivating sponsors or businesspeople to get involved earlier on because if they dont then maybe someone else is going to

6971823 his achievements probably arent as important as the fact that hes an athlete
6971824 the research ive been doing lately really seems to indicate that if you were to compare the fame of a person with their fit with the product the fit is more important
6971825 if the marketing plan itself was based solely on the performance naturally it takes a little bit of a hit
6971826 but if you have an athlete who is a quality person who still has a long career ahead of him and is a pretty young guy has a pretty good reputation as being a solid citizen all these things have to be weighed in the boardroom
6971827 turn out to be winners although hes no bargain because he was already considered the best in the world
6971828 chances are good that if hed done only slightly worse they might not really be getting their moneys worth because im sure they were cutting deals based on his potential

6971888 this move didnt come out of the void but after many meetings away from media between representatives of hezbollah and some salafist groups
6971889 but we have some reservations concerning the attack against the sunnis in may

6971898 the security of the negros rights depends almost wholly now on what the negro shall do himself to maintain them
6971899 the colored people some of whom usually vote the republican ticket are not looking forward to the war dance with as much joy as ever
6971900 useless to expect that the democratic party as a whole profess a sincere and wholesome regard for the welfare of the negro citizen

6971931 i knew i had done something wrong my beloved and i have parted ways i did not want to but she did she had told me the only reason she stayed with me for as long as she did was the fact she didnt want to hurt me that it was my own jealousy and ignorance that drove her from my arms i am lost and confused as i am finding myself asking what to do now that she is gone i am a complete wreck i am back where i started lonely and hurt as i figured out a long time ago that i would grow old and lone but when i met her i threw caution to the wind and drove head first now i have no one to whisper beautiful words into my ear
6971932 i figured out no matter how much i try i cannot lift this depression spell and no matter how much my friends try and help it never seems to work however she has touched my heart in a new way no matter what it was in the past that hurt just talking to her lifts that burden she lifts me from this depression like no other more powerful then any drug i talk to her and its as if my wounds are healing dont listen to what they think or say im struggling just to hold on i dont know how years ago i thought i knew the direction in which my life was heading i was engaged with in my mind was the most beautiful woman alive and i had everything i ever wanted it was not until we broke up did i realize how fragile love is its not something you can neglect its not something you can win its something you have to earn once earned you still have to keep at it can never stop pursuing that passion romance should never die for it if does the relationship will decay what are angels are they are higher power sent by a god up high that wears wings and has a halo an angel does not have to be any greater then you or i they can be a person as an angel can be described as an act of kindness when you love someone so much that they can do no wrong in your eyes that no matter how ugly of a situation can always see your beauty that when you talk to them even the act of expressing words sends goosebumps down your skin an angel does not mean they have to wear a halo or wings but to love you no matter what comes their way to love you no matter what you do or say

6971940 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
6971941 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters

6971989 ayat diatas dari quran jelas merujuk pada pertemuan antara sungai sungai besar dan lautan dan samudera yang lebih luas dimana sungai dalam sebagian kasus masuk kedalam air laut ber mil mil tanpa mencampurnya antara dua entitas air ini adalah fenomena yang sangat dipahami oleh ilmuan masa kini juga quran dengan jelas dan tidak dapat diragukan menekankan pada alas an untuk itu ketawaran yang satu dan keasinan yang lainnya dalam istilah ilmiah adalah perbedaan rapat jenis antara dua entitas yang juga merupakan penjelasan yang diberikan ilmuan modern
6971990 ia tuhan membuat diantaranya sebuah tongkat dan sebuah larangan keras
6971991 muhammad tidak punya laboratorium tidak juga alat riset untuk menemukan semua misteri ini dan memahami halangan ini yang jelas tertulis dalam quran ini membuktikan kalau kitab ini tidak dikarang oleh manusia namun karya satu tuhan

6971993 memang air tawar dan air asin terpisah secara fisik keluaran dari sungai menggantikan air laut namun tidak ada batasan seara termodinamis atau secara energies campurannya bersifat spontan dengan proses yang seketikan sangat ditentukan oleh pertimbangan entropi satu satunya batasan adalah kinetik dimana perlu waktu sedikit untuk mencampur kedua zat tersebut bersamaan

6971998 ive had this self centered streak that has caused me to be where i am
6971999 i was an irish catholic kid who thought it had not changed i admit one of my real dilemmas is i have two kids who went to ivy league schools im not sure my grandfather finnegan will ever forgive me for allowing that to happen but all kidding aside i wasnt a big princeton fan

6972001 i will not cut one single solitary cent of the money that we need to build those vehicles to protect these kids and they cost billions of dollars
6972002 playing the populism card the idea that rich are bad poor are good the nobility of america lies in the poor i think thats a losing general election argument i think its a losing argument period
6972003 the rich are as patriotic as the poor if you ask of them
6972004 i knew what the political vote was it was to vote no

6972008 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6972009 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6972010 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6972011 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6972012 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6972013 after overcoming so much adversity in his life eric lamaze deserves gold

6972018 i dont make any predictions about where were going to be in the conference
6972019 we deserve to be where we are picked but i think were doing ok were working hard and getting after it
6972020 we want to do better and i think we will do better
6972021 it was like weve been playing together longer than we have
6972022 we look a lot stronger than we did last year we have to just keep our heads up and hope for the best
6972023 were still rebuilding but the team comes in with a better understanding of what i expect
6972024 were trying to set realistic goals as a senior captain i just want to lead the team well and help us do well
6972025 we have to be very prepared but we get pumped up for that game
6972026 it always takes at least two years to get back on track in recruiting
6972027 our goal is to just do the best we can improve on some of the things we did well last year and get stronger in areas where we didnt do as well
6972028 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do

6972048 ano kamei san please help tanaka san as much as possible
6972049 our wide receiver position is kind of odd when you consider getting down to 53 so it made me look at the third game differently than i have in the past
6972050 in the past i always wanted the starters to come out in the third quarter thats not the case this time it could happen with a few guys but thats not the purpose of the third game this time
6972051 one is hes feeling better and i want him to feel good for the opener but then the other side of the coin is he hasnt really played a competitive down he probably has to do that so just how much he does ill have to wait and see
6972052 but thats the thing they say with backs it just takes time they said with a normal person just take six to eight weeks and hang out but this business you cant do that
6972053 he is a great young guy and a big strong player that we looked at as contributing this year its unfortu nate that he got hurt but now hes feeling good and hes back so i have my fingers crossed that he can get some playing time and feel good before the opener
6972054 were going to play probably three running backs im not positive who thats going to be yet but weve always said there is probably going to be a running back by committee we dont want to wear some of them down too much the nice thing about our backfield right now is that it was a question mark for all of us and i dont think its a question mark anymore
6972055 ran really well inside the tackle box got to the hole with good explosiveness and quickness and ran behind his pads bet ter hes got that marcus allen style more of an upright smooth weavy runner who did some nice things
6972056 he did some good things against our first defense he made some people miss broke tackles and has instant acceleration
6972057 theres about five or six guys weve talked about that will play
6972058 very smooth and hes had some really strong days over the last week hes really emerged
6972059 still slowed by his back a little bit but we think that he can do some things
6972060 makes plays and he knows the offense he can play inside or outside hes not as fast as some of those kids but his route running and knowledge of the system could get him on the field
6972061 has made some great plays out there but we need his practice habits to be more consistent
6972062 hes healthy now and hes doing a really good job devins really picked it up and hes been more consistent
6972063 should be extremely important to our running game on the perimeter because hes a big body that can go in there and dig safeties out when the defense moves up to stop the run hes a guy who should be able to go in there and put his face on you and do some damage
6972064 he is going to have a limited role right now where we can utilize his speed and quickness some guys are fast but they cant make you miss this guy is fast and he can make you miss
6972065 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6972066 the first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6972067 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
6972068 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
6972069 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
6972070 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6972071 the white house isnt a place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power
6972072 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
6972073 some good some bad it seems like ive said that all camp
6972074 well we have a week to get better and have more consistent of the good
6972075 there were some times out there we tried to slow it down and it actually worked against us
6972076 were used to going at a faster pace today when we got in that slower tempo we didnt perform quite as well
6972077 its hard to have a full time job family and go to these classes that are required
6972078 it takes a special person who is willing and can do the work of a firefighter
6972079 during the day its difficult to get the amount of people at a fire that you would normally need
6972080 at a fire scene you wont know one from the other
6972081 we have some who are career firemen at other departments and volunteer with us just because they love it
6972082 every volunteer fire department is handicapped from a manpower standpoint during the daytime hours which puts us in a position to rely on neighboring fire departments
6972083 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6972084 so its probably not wise for russia to throw these threats around
6972085 its more or less smokeless tobacco that is being targeted
6972086 tobacco is the no 1 cause of preventable disease and death in georgia
6972087 eighty percent of people start smoking before the age of 18
6972088 more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise
6972089 its about everybody at the institution rallying around the vision
6972090 the owner of chock full o nuts a white man named william black advertised in the tabloids for light colored counter help an example of nth degree discrimination
6972091 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
6972092 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god
6972093 but the natural man lost man unbeliever does not receive the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him nor can he know them for they are spiritually discerned
6972094 it is impossible to govern the world without god and the bible let us with caution indulge in the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion reason and experience both forbid us to expect that our national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
6972095 all religions are an insult to mankinds intelligence and american society and all of humanity would be better off without them
6972096 this group of 535 men and women will have accomplished a rare feat in two decades of record keeping no sitting congress has passed fewer public laws at this point in the session 294 so far than this one thats not to say theyve been idle on the flip side no congress in the same 20 years has been so prolific when it comes to proposing resolutions more than 1 900 according to a tally by the nonpartisan taxpayers for common sense

6972100 recent rainfall in some parts of the state along with the warm summer weather provides ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes
6972101 mosquitoes can be more than just a nuisance they can also make people seriously ill now is the time to fight the bite
6972102 its cheaper to rent a small automobile than drive your own personal vehicle considering todays gas prices
6972103 we have more people requesting smaller vehicles at this time we dont have quite as many in our fleet
6972104 the state provides mileage reimbursement if you drive your personal car but theres a test to make sure youre using the most reasonable cost option
6972105 the manufacturers have made it pretty clear theyre probably going to be focusing on smaller more fuel efficient cars
6972106 if customers continue to request those cars our fleet will probably evolve in that direction
6972107 people still drive the same sometimes people still ask to rent suvs
6972108 overall while many of our customers want more fuel efficient cars were still seeing steady demand for larger cars
6972109 who would tell all those stories raymond was the show
6972110 we think the provision of reasonably adequate security would have prevented ms morelands abduction and death
6972111 we have an obligation as a park to allow people on the beach with 111 nests were facing a tough fall season
6972112 there are a lot of people who feel this is not about science
6972113 i just dont see the need for the full beach closures in areas where there is space to walk or drive behind them
6972114 the occasional orv passing behind a nest is not going to have the disorienting effect that lights burning in a house all night will have

6972129 i know it was far away from my hometown and i had no friends or relatives in the area but as i learned more the more strongly i wanted to help out
6972130 it appears that there is a substantial degree of supplanting and not 100 percent supplementing
6972131 weve heard this argument before its looking at one piece of the education puzzle but not the whole puzzle
6972132 if we assume that the general assembly would have found the money for additional teachers some would say that the lottery funds are supplanting what would have been provided by the general assembly

6972136 i am fascinated by the club and circuit party scene and i am working hard to get my sounds across the country
6972137 the reason is those kinds of signs may encourage or give children or parents a false sense of security

6972171 it appears that there is a substantial degree of supplanting and not 100 percent supplementing
6972172 weve heard this argument before its looking at one piece of the education puzzle but not the whole puzzle
6972173 if we assume that the general assembly would have found the money for additional teachers some would say that the lottery funds are supplanting what would have been provided by the general assembly
6972174 pleased to see that the committee is asking the right questions and seeking the answers that the taxpayers deserve
6972175 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6972176 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6972177 the anti intellectual presidency the decline of presidential rhetoric from washington to george w bush
6972178 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
6972179 but its not my place to judge her i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver
6972180 the obama campaign is committed to north carolina and nothing shows that more than that sen obama was here on tuesday and wednesday
6972181 is the obama campaign planning to close down offices in states they have initially targeted
6972182 weve made an improvement we dont measure the teams success on how many medals we get
6972183 that was more than 20 years ago and people still say hey i saw the saturday night live skit
6972184 we do it because we love it and theres enough satisfaction in it for us
6972185 if some people think its dorky well they dont have to watch it
6972186 i think it kansas speedway is certainly capable of hosting a second date
6972187 they would do great should the opportunity of a second date present itself
6972188 they have certainly proved worthy of consideration for a second date in the years of competing there with how the crowds have been
6972189 it always has been a stronghold of nascar fans depending on how far west you get and what you describe as the midwest certainly kansas city is right in the middle of it i would say it is still underserved
6972190 we certainly had a great following here in phoenix in 2002 and generally we were very positively thought of
6972191 but the community had not really fully embraced our sport i thought if we were able to get a second race we might be able to light the fuse here in phoenix
6972192 once the second date looked like it was coming people who normally were not that interested in our sport were suddenly intrigued by what might happen we went from being an interesting little sport that happened in the fall every year to being among the very few cities in the country that has two races
6972193 it really helped put nascar front and center in the minds eye of the community
6972194 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
6972195 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
6972196 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
6972197 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
6972198 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
6972199 i think aaron rodgers has done everything right from a focus standpoint
6972200 he was put in a situation thats different hes done a very good job of focusing through that and at the end of the day you need to focus on playing quarterback and i thought he did that very well tonight
6972201 it has been a good pre season so far a lot of growing as a player and i think tonight was a good step for our offence after last week and to get the kind of time i got tonight we really needed to take a step forward and i think we did that
6972202 im happy for him hes in a tough spot over there he needed this outing
6972203 he looked sharp their offence looked good so i think theyre going to be pretty good
6972204 we audibled to just a go route because it was press and there was no safety over the top and there was a young guy in front of me
6972205 when he first came in there i was like jay when you see that 38 in there youve got to throw it up
6972206 first play was a little underthrown and i told him that if they give us the same look the next play then lets just go right back at it
6972207 when do we bring you into a project and why
6972208 why do you make a sitemap instead of the technology team
6972209 why do you suddenly get to tell me what to design if im a designer and youre not
6972210 have you ever noticed that mac users tell you what they love about their system but windows users tell you what they hate why is that
6972211 ever purchased a brand new apple mac book or macbook pro etc what was your experience like from opening the packaging looking over the very simple setup getting started page to powering it up and logging in for the first time

6972229 der wettkampfgedanke steht bei dem tramper rennen nicht im vordergrund
6972230 wenn ich morgens unter der dusche stehe denke ich das k nnen andere menschen nicht
6972231 die autofahrer die einen mitnehmen sind meistens kommunikativ und wollen wissen wer da neben ihnen sitzt
6972232 keine dunklen oder ungepflegten klamotten und ein allgemein positives erscheinen
6972233 das erste mal in der ganzen amerikanischen geschichte eine frau oder einen afroamerikaner
6972234 i had a guy from a national newspaper track me down and say have you got any comment to make all of your new album has come up on the internet and i was going its impossible its ludicrous because only four or five people had copies so i said read out the song titles that are up on the internet and he read out the track listing from the last album so i was like thats on the internet is it its also in hmv in the o section you idiot
6972235 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into mode about this
6972236 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
6972237 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law
6972238 das ist f r mich keine basis f r ein spiel wir haben so viel selbstvertrauen dass wir gewinnen wollen
6972239 der sieg ist auch das ziel von rapid wir spielen im eigenen stadion
6972240 die reaktion und die tore waren gut wenn wir weiter so treffen freut das auch den trainer es gibt keinen grund etwas zuver ndern
6972241 die austria interessiert mich nicht wir richten uns nicht nach dem gegner sondern wollen unsere philosophie durchbringen
6972242 der karli hat sein sachwissen mit dem lask beweisen und beweist dies auch jetzt mit der austria
6972243 aber es gibt einige man muss sich nur die spiele der j ngsten zeit und die aktuelle tabelle hernehmen
6972244 austria k rnten und sv kapfenberg haben gezeigt dass rapid zu hause auch probleme haben kann diese wollen wir versuchen auszunutzen wir spielen nicht auf remis sondern auf sieg
6972245 wir wollen versuchen in f hrung zu gehen und das spiel zu machen
6972246 wir haben in dieser saison schon bewiesen dass wir mit schwierigen situationen gut umgehen k nnen wir haben gegen sturm salzburg und lask sieben von neun punkten geholt und sind gut in form
6972247 die voraussetzungen f r ein spannendes und gutes spiel sind gegeben

6972250 shes got a smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child id hide and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
6972251 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6972252 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6972253 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6972254 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6972255 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6972256 the tatas will be accorded red carpet welcome to set up the project in maharashtra and will be given land and necessary facilities
6972257 every night i come up on stage and i actually feel good when i see people of different races sitting out there and showing their support i believe that fiji is where it is today not because of the tireless contribution and the massive effort of one race but its the contribution of a multi racial society
6972258 ive learnt a lot the biggest challenge is to stand up in public and speak i have grown from strength to strength and now im a confident speaker
6972259 um to check in our bags and get some food we were hungry where did you go
6972260 oh well why didnt you tell us you just gave me your bag and walked away
6972261 dont you have a bag right there that you can check
6972262 oh well i have to check mine actually because i forgot that i can not bring my shampoo and conditioner on with me do you want me to put your knife in my bag too
6972263 yes do you want to use my locks for your zippers
6972264 no need for locks im sure it will be fine
6972265 there is no fear in love true love has no room for fear because where fear is there is pain and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love
6972266 the world is a gigantic playground dont hesitate to use it
6972267 if all the water in the pond were gone how would the fish survive
6972268 oh gosh please be there and if i have to run an extra 5 miles for nothing that would suck but i guess it will be good training for my marathon
6972269 oh there you are why did you leave me in the bathroom of all places couldnt you have picked a better place to leave me than a bathroom it stinks in here
6972270 you had me all worried i am sooo glad i found you
6972271 the world is a gigantic playground dont hesitate to use it
6972272 in the ensuing gunbattle 15 militants were killed and one was arrested alive
6972273 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6972274 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6972275 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6972276 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6972277 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6972278 sleep o for a long sound sleep and so forget it
6972279 quiero a alguien capaz de retar mis ideas y no simplemente a alguien que diga que s a todo
6972280 oh thats great my partner would love that he was a monk for 4 years
6972281 satanists arent devil worshipers you know i know some satanists and they arent devil worshipers
6972282 ok then what about devil worshipers are they welcome here at the cathedral
6972283 well devil worshipers are actually christians because god made the devil
6972284 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
6972285 das allerletzte nachdem wir schon f r juni eine deadline gesetzt hatten
6972286 ich habe zur ckgeschrieben dass ich mit dem angebot noch nicht zufrieden bin aber auch dass ich weiter beim lask bleiben m chte und noch mit keinem anderen klub in kontakt stehe
6972287 es wird keine verhandlungen mehr geben florian klein hatte lange genug zeit sich das zu berlegen entweder er findet bis 31 august einen neuen arbeitgeber oder er sitzt bei uns auf der trib ne
6972288 we were 3 2 down in injury time and you get out with the draw you should be feeling lucky
6972289 but im not feeling lucky at all im feeling that game should have been dead and buried well and truly prior to that
6972290 we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal
6972291 but it tends to be the situation that when youre not ruthless and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6972292 to the glorys credit they never stopped trying and even in the second half when they probably had a little more possession and a little more territory we still had ample chances of killing the game off and we didnt do it
6972293 and dont try to say i wasnt talking to you
6972294 mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind
6972295 war does not determine who is right only who is left
6972296 a ship without marines is like a garment without buttons
6972297 whether you like it or not history is on our side we will bury you
6972298 cost of a single tomahawk cruise missile 22 raptor 135 million
6972299 the deadliest weapon in the world is a marine and his rifle
6972300 whoever stands by a just cause cannot possibly be called a terrorist
6972301 nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result
6972302 war is delightful to those who have not yet experienced it
6972303 diplomats are just as essential in starting a war as soldiers are for finishing it
6972304 all that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing
6972305 older men declare war but it is the youth that must fight and die
6972306 freedom is not free but the u s marine corps will pay most of your share
6972307 if your attack is going too well youre walking into an ambush
6972308 when the pin is pulled mr grenade is not our friend
6972309 a man may die nations may rise and fall but an idea lives on
6972310 if you cant remember the claymore is pointed toward you
6972311 the more marines i have around the better i like it
6972312 never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder
6972313 try to look unimportant they may be low on ammo
6972314 heroes may not be braver than anyone else theyre just brave five minutes longer
6972315 in the end it was luck we were this close to nuclear war and luck prevented it
6972316 it is generally inadvisable to eject directly over the area you just bombed
6972317 if at first you dont succeed call an air strike
6972318 teamwork is essential it gives them other people to shoot at
6972319 the real and lasting victories are those of peace and not of war
6972320 in war you win or lose live or die and the difference is just an eyelash
6972321 you cant say civilization dont advance for in every war they kill you in a new way
6972322 it is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it
6972323 anyone who truly wants to go to war has truly never been there before
6972324 whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart whoever wants it back has no brain
6972325 my first wish is to see this plague of mankind war banished from the earth
6972326 if a man has done his best what else is there
6972327 the bursting radius of a hand grenade is always one foot greater than your jumping range
6972328 every tyrant who has lived has believed in freedom for himself
6972329 a lot of wonderful people love their country and hate the military
6972330 a soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon
6972331 all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
6972332 an eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind
6972333 god is not on the side of the big battalions but on the side of those who shoot best
6972334 i have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another
6972335 i venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people
6972336 if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other
6972337 im fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in
6972338 if you could go die in a fire thatd be great lpine
6972339 in war there is no prize for the runner up
6972340 it is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it
6972341 it is only the dead who have seen the end of war
6972342 it is well that war is so terrible or we should grow too fond of it
6972343 mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind
6972344 never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few
6972345 no one ever goes into battle thinking god is on the other side
6972346 older men declare war but its the youth who must fight and die
6972347 politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
6972348 put your trust in god but be sure to keep your powder dry
6972349 the battle of waterloo was won on the playing fields of eton
6972350 the death of one man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic
6972351 the only winner in the war of 1812 was tchaikovsky
6972352 the victor will never be asked if he told the truth
6972353 the whole art of war consists of guessing at what is on the other side of the hill
6972354 there never was a good war or a bad peace
6972355 to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace
6972356 to jaw jaw is always better than to war war
6972357 today we did what we had to do they counted on america to be passive they were wrong
6972358 war does not determine who is right only who is left
6972359 war is too serious a matter to entrust to military men
6972360 when the rich wage war its the poor who die
6972361 when you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite
6972362 you can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake
6972363 you can make a throne of bayonets but you cant sit on it for long
6972364 when the enemy advances withdraw when he stops harass when he tires strike when he retreats pursue
6972365 war can only be abolished through war and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
6972366 their sword will become our plow and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow
6972367 the object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his
6972368 history teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap
6972369 england has been offered a choice between war and shame she has chosen shame and will get war
6972370 britain and france had to choose between war and dishonor they chose dishonor they will have war
6972371 darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that
6972372 all men are brothers like the seas throughout the world so why do winds and waves clash so fiercely everywhere
6972373 cluster bombing from b 52s are very very accurate the bombs are guaranteed to always hit the ground
6972374 whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword obviously never encountered automatic weapons
6972375 let your plans be as dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt
6972376 theyll be no learning period with nuclear weapons make one mistake and youre going to destroy nations
6972377 it doesnt take a hero to order men into battle it takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle
6972378 any soldier worth his salt should be anti war and still there are things worth fighting for
6972379 the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to the destruction of nations
6972380 tyrants have always some slight shade of virtue they support the laws before destroying them
6972381 if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles
6972382 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
6972383 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
6972384 if the wings are traveling faster than the fuselage its probably a helicopter and therefore unsafe
6972385 the truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do the hard part is doing it
6972386 you cant say that civilization dont advance however for in every war they kill you in a new way
6972387 the commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise
6972388 i think the human race needs to think about killing how much evil must we do to do good
6972389 any military commander who is honest will admit he makes mistakes in the application of military power
6972390 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
6972391 never think that war no matter how necessary nor how justified is not a crime ask the infantry and ask the dead
6972392 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
6972393 the tyrant always talks as if hes preserving the best interests of his people when he actually acts to undermine them
6972394 we sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would harm us
6972395 if we cant persuade nations with comparable values of the merits of our cause wed better reexamine our reasoning
6972396 keep looking below surface appearances dont shrink from doing so just because you might not like what you find
6972397 there are only two kinds of people that understand marines marines and the enemy everyone else has a second hand opinion
6972398 war is a bloody killing business youve got to spill their blood or they will spill yours rip them up the belly shoot them in the guts
6972399 i think that technologies are morally neutral until we apply them its only when we use them for good or evil that they become good or evil
6972400 some people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world but the marines dont have that problem
6972401 mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind
6972402 war does not determine who is right only who is left
6972403 a ship without marines is like a garment without buttons
6972404 whether you like it or not history is on our side we will bury you
6972405 cost of a single b 2 bomber 2 2 billion
6972406 so long as there are men there will be wars
6972407 the deadliest weapon in the world is a marine and his rifle
6972408 whoever stands by a just cause cannot possibly be called a terrorist
6972409 nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result
6972410 war is delightful to those who have not yet experienced it

6972441 god is not on the side of the big battalions but on the side of those who shoot best
6972442 i have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another
6972443 i venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people
6972444 if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other
6972445 im fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in
6972446 if you could go die in a fire thatd be great lpine
6972447 in war there is no prize for the runner up
6972448 it is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it
6972449 it is only the dead who have seen the end of war
6972450 it is well that war is so terrible or we should grow too fond of it
6972451 mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind
6972452 never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few
6972453 no one ever goes into battle thinking god is on the other side
6972454 older men declare war but its the youth who must fight and die
6972455 politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
6972456 put your trust in god but be sure to keep your powder dry
6972457 the battle of waterloo was won on the playing fields of eton
6972458 the death of one man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic
6972459 the only winner in the war of 1812 was tchaikovsky
6972460 the victor will never be asked if he told the truth
6972461 the whole art of war consists of guessing at what is on the other side of the hill
6972462 there never was a good war or a bad peace
6972463 to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace
6972464 to jaw jaw is always better than to war war
6972465 today we did what we had to do they counted on america to be passive they were wrong
6972466 war does not determine who is right only who is left
6972467 war is too serious a matter to entrust to military men
6972468 when the rich wage war its the poor who die
6972469 when you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite
6972470 you can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake
6972471 you can make a throne of bayonets but you cant sit on it for long
6972472 when the enemy advances withdraw when he stops harass when he tires strike when he retreats pursue
6972473 war can only be abolished through war and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
6972474 their sword will become our plow and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow
6972475 the object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his
6972476 history teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap
6972477 england has been offered a choice between war and shame she has chosen shame and will get war
6972478 britain and france had to choose between war and dishonor they chose dishonor they will have war
6972479 darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that
6972480 all men are brothers like the seas throughout the world so why do winds and waves clash so fiercely everywhere
6972481 cluster bombing from b 52s are very very accurate the bombs are guaranteed to always hit the ground
6972482 whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword obviously never encountered automatic weapons
6972483 let your plans be as dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt
6972484 theyll be no learning period with nuclear weapons make one mistake and youre going to destroy nations
6972485 it doesnt take a hero to order men into battle it takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle
6972486 any soldier worth his salt should be anti war and still there are things worth fighting for
6972487 the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to the destruction of nations
6972488 tyrants have always some slight shade of virtue they support the laws before destroying them
6972489 if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles
6972490 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
6972491 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
6972492 if the wings are traveling faster than the fuselage its probably a helicopter and therefore unsafe
6972493 the truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do the hard part is doing it
6972494 you cant say that civilization dont advance however for in every war they kill you in a new way
6972495 the commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise
6972496 i think the human race needs to think about killing how much evil must we do to do good
6972497 any military commander who is honest will admit he makes mistakes in the application of military power
6972498 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
6972499 never think that war no matter how necessary nor how justified is not a crime ask the infantry and ask the dead
6972500 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
6972501 the tyrant always talks as if hes preserving the best interests of his people when he actually acts to undermine them
6972502 we sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would harm us
6972503 if we cant persuade nations with comparable values of the merits of our cause wed better reexamine our reasoning
6972504 keep looking below surface appearances dont shrink from doing so just because you might not like what you find
6972505 there are only two kinds of people that understand marines marines and the enemy everyone else has a second hand opinion
6972506 war is a bloody killing business youve got to spill their blood or they will spill yours rip them up the belly shoot them in the guts
6972507 i think that technologies are morally neutral until we apply them its only when we use them for good or evil that they become good or evil
6972508 some people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world but the marines dont have that problem
6972509 were in a world in which the possiblity of terrorism married up with technology could make us very very sorry we didnt act
6972510 no way in hell am i posting a topless photo of myself for you guys
6972511 being a republican or democrat was as much a hereditary statement on the civil war as it was an expression of ideology
6972512 the definition of who the people are has changed dramatically
6972513 the door creaks open a man peeks out and says yeah what do you want i say is this the caucus he shuts the door i heard them talking he cracks it open again whats your name he says i tell him he shuts the door i hear them talking they were actually deciding whether to let me in the caucus
6972514 jesus mary and joseph i place my soul in your hands
6972515 its just another charm offensive to get the shamans off their backs
6972516 americans can afford optimism partly because their institutions including the constitution were conceived by men who thought tragically
6972517 we are in territory that none of us have been in before
6972518 and let them know that i am doing my best and try to get their vote
6972519 they are splitting up their resources because there are so many candidates
6972520 there are people connected with my campaign who may not have been connected to a campaign that was run in may
6972521 this seems to be an election year that has everyones interest
6972522 if there are issues that resonate with them they will begin to tune in to that
6972523 im not sure but they dont look normal they dont smell normal either
6972524 i just dont get horses such big creatures yet afraid of everything how lame
6972525 how could any horse not find me attractive im not much different than a horse and i have much prettier hair
6972526 we have told them that if they see any suspicious objects or persons who may be seen in the station frequently they could be terrorists and that they report it to us
6972527 rpf commandants and inspectors have instructed us to keep a close eye on any suspicious persons as we go about our daily selling activities
6972528 to me the idea is to engage somebody to look at something and they dont even know its science
6972529 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it

6972533 its a large fire but fortunately its in a remote area
6972534 weve evacuating as a precaution but the big thing is to keep everyone safe including our own
6972535 if we dont give up setpiece goals this is a battle
6972536 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6972537 the last three decades of my life scattered around my feet like cherry blossoms after a spring rain
6972538 our defensive coaches had a great scheme to stop him
6972539 we were going to stop him and make everyone else hurt us we did a great job of doing that he is a great athlete
6972540 we made some mistakes had some miss snaps on offense but there are no excuses
6972541 he is only a sophomore and he is going to get a lot better
6972542 i like how he did but i expect a lot out of our backs he has got a chance to shine over the next few years
6972543 we were real concerned because jones has a lot of speed and we dont have as much speed as weve had in years past
6972544 i thought our defense played excellent and i thought our offensive line really took control of the game we felt real good about that
6972545 when we start playing as a team gelling as a team cut down on mistakes we are going to be fine
6972546 once i got the first snap the nervousness just went away
6972547 i was just in a rhythm i was feeling good
6972548 weve got some experience back at quarterback and wide receiver
6972549 theyre expected to do that theyve played a lot of football
6972550 i thought after the first series we completely shut them down
6972551 thats a tough offense to have to get ready for the first game
6972552 but when youre out there in single coverage youre going to give up some passes its a tough position to play
6972553 he made one bad read all night he didnt see that middle linebacker coming on that inside slant thats something weve got to get away from throwing picks
6972554 i changed the play we scored on it and we were already up i shouldnt have done that but it was just clicking
6972555 now well go back and look at some tape and see where we need to get better
6972556 nothing but dry food from now on i want to see ribs on this dog next time you bring it in
6972557 maam youd eat dry dog food if you were hungry enough
6972558 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
6972559 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6972560 if you want creative workers give them enough time to play
6972561 i was struck by one story the book about a man who went to his fireplace and told it
6972562 the first duty of a leader is to make himself be loved without courting love to be loved without playing up to anyone even to himself
6972563 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race
6972564 i think we are definitely capable of running under three minutes
6972565 i think we can break the australian record its 2 59 70
6972566 we ran three minutes point six and this is our b team and with sean wroe in here i think we can do that it just depends how the race is going and the changes pan out

6972572 he danced for us in the introduction he danced for us at the end i mean he put on a show to me hes just like michael phelps
6972573 because ive walked by and ive heard guys who are a little disappointed in the way he acts in front of the camera
6972574 this guy has worked his tail off everyday on his knees throwing up in practice
6972575 he deserves to dance if you think its disrespectful work harder so you can be the one dancing
6972576 im serious he bought my nuggets because i didnt really want to go to the cafeteria i came straight to the track and my masseuse again bought me more nuggets and i just had two though because my coach said i should not eat so many nuggets before a race
6972577 he enjoys the moment that inspired michael johnson to run fast why cant that inspire usain bolt
6972578 it makes me think that people dont believe in hard work anymore i mean s t if you work hard you can achieve things
6972579 i talked to the prime minister he told me that everything in jamaica is blocked off
6972580 we have some of the best coaches in the world
6972581 theyre qualified at all levels in all disciplines you name it 100m 50m hurdles high jump we take every event seriously
6972582 britains first safe text street has been created complete with padded lampposts to protect millions of mobile phone users from getting hurt in street accidents while walking and texting
6972583 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6972584 the first time im going to ask you the second time im going to tell you by the third time im going to give you a swat or remove your toys depending on the situation
6972585 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6972586 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders while i realize the dangerous precedent of allowing the lowest common denominator dictate what is and is not a valid form of expression unfortunately the current tone has totally obfuscated the original aims of the piece while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation due to these profound misunderstandings i simply feel that from an artistic point of view the work has lost the ability to have any valuable impact poetic or otherwise i have not been pressured by the leipziger messe nor by the computerspiele museum in this decision to the contrary they have offered their support in defending the right of artists to speak freely and in whatever context they may choose

6972595 the children heard the lion and first thought it was a cow but when they realised it was lion they ran screaming into their classrooms to hide
6972596 luckily the school keeps its gates locked because the children arent allowed to leave during break
6972597 we would be talking a different story today if the school wasnt fenced
6972598 i dont want to hear that pupils are being eaten by lions because a school was not fenced the money for fencing is there

6972609 one of our key findings was that we were not leveraging our affiliation with harvard as effectively as we could be
6972610 theres a lot of confusion out there as to who we even are
6972611 i highly suspect though i have not started the software examination yet that the phone jack works but that the linux distribution does not yet support the soft modem drivers to make it run and to avoid confusion asus decided to plug the port instead
6972612 the modem jack in the asus eee pc is plugged because there are no drivers for it
6972613 it would be hell to get everything on a macbook properly working in linux
6972614 if i had a neo 1973 this would be easy

6972616 i was recently talking to a friend about the fortune 100 company she works for in it she told me the company has 35 000 employees including over 5 000 it employees and its not a web firm it has numerous consultants doing it work as well to me from a background where my last job had 50 it employees and 1 000 total a 1 in 7 ratio of it employees seems extremely high yet she mentioned even simple changes to systems software take over six months so what ratio does your company have and what is reasonable how much does this differ by industry
6972617 climate change is governed by hundreds of factors the very idea that we can manage climate change predictably by understanding and manipulating at the margins one politically selected factor is as misguided as it gets

6972666 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
6972667 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6972668 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20 billion id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer
6972669 this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security

6972687 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
6972688 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
6972689 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
6972690 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
6972691 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
6972692 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6972693 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6972694 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6972695 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6972697 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6972698 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6972699 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6972700 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6972701 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6972702 directly wrote articles edited and approved without checking sources news and articles with seriously untrue information concerning the pmu18 case
6972703 paying the price for his news on a matter which is not yet over but which unravels in a very strange manner
6972704 instigated objections against legal protection agencies for investigating and arresting journalists nguyen viet chien and nguyen van hai
6972705 we think this has a negative effect on other journalists who want to report whatever story they can find

6972713 when he came in as coach in 2005 he decided we werent going to settle for being maybe a contender he got the guys into good training facilities and good teams overseas he instilled a new philosophy of working hard and together with no superstars and picking each other up everyone bought into it
6972714 the sum of our parts is much greater than any individual this team is doing it the right way
6972715 winning or losing isnt going to affect how i feel about myself as a player but it sure is going to be nice having a medal in the house
6972716 one of the reasons im here is because i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own
6972717 given that responsibility and that im the leader of this team theres some accountability on my part to be here and do my job
6972718 seriously wtf was biden leaked in the middle of the night is the obama camp that sloppy

6972723 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6972724 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6972725 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6972726 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6972727 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6972728 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6972729 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6972730 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6972731 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6972732 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6972733 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6972734 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6972735 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6972736 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6972737 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6972738 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6972739 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
6972740 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6972741 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6972742 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6972743 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6972744 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6972745 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6972746 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6972747 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6972748 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6972749 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6972750 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6972751 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6972752 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6972753 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6972754 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6972755 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6972756 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6972757 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6972761 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6972762 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6972763 we no longer just have one or two people working at any given time
6972764 we gave at least three or four working here and theyre very in tuned with what to look for
6972765 what we have learned is try and lower your cameras so we can shoot at someones face and not just get the top of their heads
6972766 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6972767 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6972768 a potential willing suitor for a company that recently has been all about headline risk is providing solid footing for the financial sector

6972770 lets hope he is right most of us think he is the bulls would agree on his comments about valuations
6972771 he thinks he can appease women with flowers instead of dealing forthrightly with the problem
6972772 what no flowers for ken maybe he couldnt figure out what kind he likes
6972773 ken and ingrid were right i should not have done this and i neglected for several years to do anything about my association with this group for that i am sorry
6972774 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6972775 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6972776 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6972777 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6972778 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6972779 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6972780 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6972783 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6972784 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6972785 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6972786 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6972787 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6972788 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6972789 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6972790 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6972791 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
6972792 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
6972793 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
6972794 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
6972795 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6972796 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6972797 we will continue to review all of our liquidity facilities to determine if they are having their intended effects or require modification

6972799 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6972800 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6972801 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6972802 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6972803 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6972804 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6972805 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6972806 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6972807 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6972808 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6972809 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6972810 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6972811 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6972812 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6972813 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6972814 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6972815 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6972816 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6972817 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6972818 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6972819 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6972820 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6972821 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6972822 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6972823 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice

6972829 online banking is a big part of our history as a company
6972830 we were a trailblazer in looking for ways that our customers conduct business when where and how they wanted to
6972831 it allows us to be competitive in a free classified marketplace to reach additional users customers who only use free classified marketplaces
6972832 consumers are more likely to look for items on a paid to post site because theres an implied trust and that value is magnified by the name recognition and marketing efforts of our national affiliates
6972833 its a space that everybody is trying to get into our position is we will just continue to serve our viewers as best we can and look for other opportunities to meet the needs the community has
6972834 its definitely added a new revenue steam to the web site than we had prior

6972836 we are still monitoring and analyzing prices to see if they are out of line with trends
6972837 ive been doing this for more than 20 years and utahs gas prices always been lower than nevada and california
6972838 would be selling it below cost this is telling me that the local refineries are higher than the national average
6972839 the market is what it is prices reflect the intersection of supply and demand

6972849 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6972850 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6972851 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6972852 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6972853 hes been very special i actually wanted to take him out in the sixth inning but he pleaded begged told me hed be ok he said i cant come out of this game i said ok go get em and he went out and got em

6972856 id like to have that opportunity to make that decision ive been asked that question a lot the answer is i dont know

6972879 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6972880 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6972881 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6972882 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6972883 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6972884 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6972885 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6972886 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6972887 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6972888 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6972889 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6972890 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6972891 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6972892 when youre coaching these guys its not that you dont do it with your own college or pro teams you need to be on top of your game all the time because they deserve that
6972893 in a constant state of preparation and never feels like hes completely prepared
6972894 i feel like weve been through the wars together for years and whatever were facing whether its a tough year with the team or the ncaa tournament or whatever i recognize him and i know where hes at
6972895 he is different for this i think he feels so much responsibility that it goes beyond a tournament or winning a game or even a gold medal i have had to stand back and try to get a grip on whats going on
6972896 there is a similarity to when he was a young coach
6972897 but i dont think he has ever felt this sense of responsibility even then he feels hes carrying an amazing load
6972898 not possible because there arent enough decent colleges and universities around
6972899 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6972900 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6972901 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6972902 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6972903 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6972904 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6972905 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6972906 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6972907 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6972908 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6972909 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6972910 prepare to die workingmen j p morgan amp co want preparedness for profit
6972911 her fiery denunciation of capitalism does not square with the fact that upon her death she left an estate valued at over 100 000 much of it in industrial stockholdings
6972912 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6972913 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6972914 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6972915 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6972916 byington had a penchant for writing letters to the editor all across the country he wrote on virtually every subject grammatical usage president harrisons foreign policy the equality of races and why the ostrich hides his head in the sand
6972917 byington wasnt afraid to stick out like a sore thumb to make a point being an anarchist in the 1890 1920 period was unpopular to take a stand for what he believed in despite the prevailing opposition to anarchism was admirable and i think one of the marks of greatness
6972918 in many ways the two were cut from the same cloth but byington was brainier maybe this is why thoreau is famous and byington is not after all an article titled the attributive noun becomes cancerous which byington wrote for american speech in october 1926 wouldnt have been the most engaging reading by any means
6972919 no legal tender law is ever needed to make men take good money its only use is to make them take bad money kick it out
6972920 byington is sometimes erroneously listed as the author who was really rudolf erich raspe because his name appears on the spine
6972921 i beg to differ young man your interpretation of the passage is incorrect going back to the hebrew the essence of the passage reads as follows
6972922 the younger man was speechless as byington read the passage in hebrew aramaic greek latin and german to compare the meaning little did the student know that his audience in this small country church would include a scholar whose achievements were greater than any of the instructors at the divinity school the young student later returned to ballard vale as the regular minister and the two men became fast friends
6972923 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6972924 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6972925 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6972926 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6972927 this play is true within the substantial limitations of one persons subjective experience
6972928 like the lead in a romantic comedy pre makeover it was like a john hughes movie was throwing up on her all the time
6972929 we were muscular disgruntled jocks whose clothing constantly wicked moisture away from our bodies
6972930 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6972931 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6972932 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6972933 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6972934 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6972935 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6972936 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6972937 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6972938 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6972939 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6972940 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6972941 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6972942 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6972943 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6972944 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6972945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6972946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6972947 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6972948 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6972949 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6972950 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6972951 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6972952 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6972953 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6972954 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6972955 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6972956 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6972957 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6972958 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6972959 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6972960 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6972961 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6972962 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6972963 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6972964 conhe o essa can o desde crian a existe um aspecto misterioso nela do qual sempre gostei
6972965 this is the biggest game any of us have ever played in
6972966 its bigger than the nba championship its bigger than any college championship
6972967 what i do care about though is this gold medal
6972968 i cant go back home to north carolina without it
6972969 ive even watched power walking race walking on tv i never knew that was an olympic sport
6972970 this isnt what the administration was expecting when they went into the process of negotiating these agreements
6972971 any successful politician in iraq is going to have to run as a nationalist
6972972 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground
6972973 the president said he never heard any democrats making the argument that
6972974 i am glad that the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6972975 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6972976 the fact of the matter is the iraqis demanded some timeline for our departure and the bush administration acceded to their demands
6972977 we should not forget that this is possible only because of the surge a strategy many predicted would fail and that some cannot even today recognize as a stunning success
6972978 if you believe as most iraqis do that theres been a heck of a lot of progress over here what is the next thing theyre going to say
6972979 when are these guys finally leaving so we can get on with our lives
6972980 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6972981 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue
6972982 we are going to do everything we can to create a situation where merriman is not in pain and the leg gets some strength back
6972983 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6972984 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6972985 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6972986 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6972987 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6972988 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6972989 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6972990 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6972991 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6972992 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6972993 if you trust every web site but not a government
6972994 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6972995 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6972996 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6972997 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6972998 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6972999 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6973000 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6973001 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6973006 it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come goodell
6973007 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6973008 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6973009 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6973010 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize new york jets chairman robert wood johnson
6973011 gene was an outstanding advocate for the players and he made many great contributions to our sport he was also a good and decent man he will be sorely missed new york giants president john mara

6973021 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6973022 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6973023 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6973024 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6973025 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6973026 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6973027 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6973028 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6973029 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6973030 nosotros sabemos que ellos no se van a parar a atacarnos pero querr n imponer su estilo y ah es donde debemos ser inteligentes
6973031 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6973032 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6973033 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6973034 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6973035 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6973036 the legacy act is crucial to the restoration of the national treasure that we have right here on our doorstep the great lakes
6973037 once its completed the kinnickinnic river legacy act cleanup will contribute significantly to the ultimate goal of getting the milwaukee estuary area of concern off the list of contaminated sites around the great lakes
6973038 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6973039 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
6973040 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6973041 you get used to it in the beginning its like coffee or wine you dont really like it but then you try it a second time to be like the adults and gradually you end up really liking it
6973042 but i dont know if it was because of the alcohol or the taste of the fish
6973043 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6973044 who would tell all those stories raymond was the show
6973045 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6973046 these service members are very attractive to marketers they must have the knowledge they need to make sound financial decisions
6973047 after the training they can take the certification test to know how much information they have retained
6973048 5 1 percent is still a relatively low unemployment rate but higher than we usually see in the triangle
6973049 if you look at economic growth and employment charlotte and the triangle continue to lead the state
6973050 i think unemployment will continue to trend higher this year and into 2009 to 5 5 percent to 6 percent which is very high for the raleigh durham area
6973051 the product offers a lot but delivers nothing the only thing this product will flush from your system is cash
6973052 it is aimed at folks who have already lost their homes and may be very vulnerable to promises of big winnings really this is just heartbreaking
6973053 any time there is an offer of a free trial period it should raise a caution flag
6973054 more and more online businesses rely on a cancellation policy that puts the responsibility for canceling the account at the end of the trial period on the consumer read the fine print and make sure you understand how the billing works and what you need to do to avoid unanticipated payments
6973055 a decision has to be based on some discriminative factor
6973056 warren buffett said the economy is still in a recession and unlikely to improve before 2009 but that stocks appear better valued than a year ago
6973057 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6973058 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6973059 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment add to this mix a jump in inflation and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6973060 i lost a bit of my concentration in the second set i dont know why
6973061 ive just recovered from a cold ive played a lot of matches these last couple of weeks tonight im paying for it
6973062 ive rekindled the fire ive found a great feel around the court im really on the right track
6973063 ive known caroline since i was eleven i knew that you have to be 100 percent in order to beat her it was just not the case today
6973064 i feel really confident its been a really good month for me
6973065 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didnt happen
6973066 a generation that refuses to give back their jerseys they will not be stopped the museum awaits

6973068 rich folks are as patriotic as poor folks but we dont talk that way
6973069 i dont want to be president if thats the way i have to win because i cant govern that way
6973070 if you werent the nominee the right wing would not be so exercised
6973071 visibly sneered at witnesses in senate hearings who questioned agents acts
6973072 celebrities don t have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6973073 are there two hs in the middle or does the first one absorb the second
6973074 because of whats coming we have to make some difficult decisions and take the necessary steps to prevent a future calamity
6973075 i like to invest in wonderful companies that an idiot could run because sooner or later one will
6973076 in fact you could say that this country is like that too
6973077 today is the day the lord has made love you
6973078 i am going to punch grant from u haul in the head
6973079 it was too slow i never really made any money
6973080 i underestimated the amount of time it would take for it to become solvent
6973081 i kept having this dream where i was in an art gallery writing and i thought what the hey
6973082 i needed a place to live so i bought this live work space and started this art gallery
6973083 i have no experience running a gallery but i do collect art thats my experience with art
6973084 its going to be a great loss for all the artists in that area
6973085 theres just not enough venues for artists to show and sell their stuff through
6973086 people that i didnt know came to see my work they came specifically to see me and that helps
6973087 every time i visited the gregory kate gallery i was welcomed like a guest in a friends home chris and i had many heart to heart conversations and i felt very nurtured as an artist
6973088 i was sad to find out he was closing the gallery doors because the world needs more exhibit spaces with people like chris running them who believe in the importance of art in peoples lives
6973089 i live here and it would probably do me more harm than good
6973090 i want the neighborhood to be our customers after they came over and expressed their concern i dropped it
6973091 the reason we applied is that times are very hard and we thought maybe people would like music
6973092 what do i need to do to have the communitys business
6973093 do i renovate the patio work on landscaping offer different food tell me what you want what can i do to have your business
6973094 the economy is so bad we need to be innovative
6973095 i want to do business in the neighborhood i dont want to be a nuisance id rather have neighbors come here than customers from los gatos come once a year
6973096 noni watch this noni noni noni noni noni noni noni noni noni noni are you watching watch this

6973107 and he said no that i had to stay to talk with their fbi representative
6973108 when the officer told me i couldnt leave i packed up my camera gear sat in my car and waited for cpl tom robison
6973109 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6973110 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6973111 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6973112 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6973113 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6973114 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6973115 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6973116 i just think john brumby should be here and explaining this to victorians
6973117 hes sent a lot of mixed messages lately he was there in the parliament on thursday patting himself on the back claiming job growth claiming it for the government and when the job losses are announced hes vanished
6973118 they cant send a message that theyre going to back off population growth just a few weeks after theyve been celebrating population growth

6973140 who gave you this chocolate osama bin laden tell us
6973141 if we dont give up setpiece goals this is a battle
6973142 i started out so well and came back and had some really poor events and being physically exhausted after the first day knowing i was going to come in the second day with only four hours of sleep just getting yourself up for every event to keep plugging away it was tough
6973143 i came out here to help usain who was trying to win three gold medals and set three world records
6973144 its just a great feeling this is what weve all been working for
6973145 but im going to try to get over it really quick my night came a couple of nights ago and i need to cherish that moment
6973146 this is the biggest game any of us have ever played in
6973147 its bigger than the nba championship its bigger than any college championship
6973148 what i do care about though is this gold medal
6973149 i cant go back home to north carolina without it
6973150 ive even watched power walking race walking on tv i never knew that was an olympic sport
6973151 i knew i had to play the game of my life to keep us in this
6973152 its my best game as of yet but theres more to come youll see
6973153 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
6973154 and kind of showed everyone that the sport is really awesome
6973155 i love n c state football and i love this team
6973156 i love my teammates and i love this university so im really going to do anything i can to help this team win
6973157 i really cant find the words to describe that type of quarterback and athletic ability that he displayed on the field
6973158 but its like it becomes a second nature to him hes at home hes comfortable
6973159 but i guess they chose him because they think hes the best quarterback to help them win
6973160 when youre coaching these guys its not that you dont do it with your own college or pro teams you need to be on top of your game all the time because they deserve that
6973161 in a constant state of preparation and never feels like hes completely prepared
6973162 i feel like weve been through the wars together for years and whatever were facing whether its a tough year with the team or the ncaa tournament or whatever i recognize him and i know where hes at
6973163 he is different for this i think he feels so much responsibility that it goes beyond a tournament or winning a game or even a gold medal i have had to stand back and try to get a grip on whats going on
6973164 there is a similarity to when he was a young coach
6973165 but i dont think he has ever felt this sense of responsibility even then he feels hes carrying an amazing load
6973166 jamie is capable of buying us some time on passing plays and were going to need all of the extra time we can create
6973167 russell loved the facilities at state and it was close to home
6973168 jesus said to them i am the bread of life whoever comes to me will never hunger and whoever believes in me will never thirst
6973169 im not going to take you to a wild club or anything like that where youll get into trouble
6973170 im going to take you places where youll see people you need to see see other football players see basketball players see guys and girls not surround you with bad things
6973171 the linebackers defensive ends everybody played well especially in the second half
6973172 in the first half though we werent hitting on all cylinders offensively but we started to click in the second half but the defense played big the whole way
6973173 we had some new guys on the offensive line but they stepped right up and played just like we left off last year
6973174 he has done everything asked of him from the university division of athletics and mens basketball program to atone for his actions and has learned and grown from his mistake
6973175 were in a totally different situation not in a one horse show
6973176 they simmons and lindsay know how to do all the little things the right way make the adjustments holtz said
6973177 its not just knowing what to do its knowing how to do it when the defense changes those guys understand the whole scheme
6973178 its about being patient waiting for things to open up using your blockers and speed
6973179 someone said he looks like the tiger woods of the amateurs and thats exactly how it looks
6973180 its hard to compete when someone is playing so well and youre playing the opposite
6973181 i didnt play my a game or my b game
6973182 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
6973183 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
6973184 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6973185 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it
6973186 i knew what was going on i was falling behind in counts and not being aggressive
6973187 tonight i came out attacked the strike zone and got ahead
6973188 it is nice in the first game of the season to be that explosive
6973189 the great thing about it is so many running backs got their hands on it and did good things when they got it
6973190 the defense played exceptionally well except for that fake punt
6973191 they are both veterans and it is expected of them because they are both great backs
6973192 they are both explosive and can score at any time
6973193 he stopped turned around and theres the alley right there go get it
6973194 we came out here with a chip on our shoulder
6973195 we had something to prove to show that he was still with us
6973196 after my first touchdown i hit the side of my helmet and pointed up to the sky
6973197 atlas may be gone but i wanted everyone to know that he is still with us in spirit
6973198 its a good night to be a wildcat and its going to be a great season to be a wildcat
6973199 were going to run the ball more clayton head coach gary fowler has rubbed off on me weve got to get the ball to our playmakers mallie and c j and tonight we did that
6973200 we made a lot of mistakes tonight and gave up some big plays at the end of that half
6973201 we stopped tackling and they were the more physical team tonight
6973202 for these players i think its very important to bring success back to this community the storied program that northern is there is no reason that we shouldnt have success and fun like we did tonight
6973203 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6973204 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6973205 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6973206 its good its just nice to be back in there
6973207 because of all of the early season errors and then we decided to turn it into a war documentary in the second half
6973208 a game like this tells you a lot about our players and they responded well to adversity against a good football team in clayton
6973209 we made a lot of mistakes you cant turn the ball over four times and sanderson played real hard
6973210 but the thing we have to build on is our kids didnt quit we stayed with it for the full 48 minutes of play
6973211 i thought both teams played well considering this was only the third game of the season
6973212 but the most important part of the season is yet to come for us
6973213 its good to have a couple of hard fought games early in the season like that
6973214 every sport thats being competed at the olympics is cool to watch because theyre just the best in the world at it the track and field stuff is amazing i got to watch the 100 and 200 and some hurdles
6973215 tom my motor home driver says hes gonna put up a badminton court hes really excited about it because we played in school but you play for a week or something and thats all the badminton we ever played
6973216 joel welser does a tremendous job covering college basketball he gives his readers knowledgeable and insightful information on college hoops
6973217 joel welser writes clean knowledgeable copy that always hits deadline
6973218 i have been pondering michael and saras relationship for a long time and could never find the answer until i wrote to nick santora on myspace i asked him if michael and his wife ever got their marriage annulled or gone through a divorce or were they still married
6973219 hi so glad you are excited yup hes still legally married
6973220 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6973221 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
6973222 baku tablisi cayhan pipeline that has the potential to compete with the russian pipelines
6973223 we are now in a fight against the great russia
6973224 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6973225 georgian prime minister vladimer lado gurgenidze jewish made a special call to israel tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the haredi communitys most important rabbis and spiritual leaders rabbi aharon leib steinman
6973226 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
6973227 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
6973228 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
6973229 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
6973230 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
6973231 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
6973232 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
6973233 there are a few countries that will say told you so
6973234 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
6973235 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
6973236 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
6973237 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
6973238 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
6973239 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
6973240 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
6973241 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
6973242 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
6973243 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
6973244 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
6973245 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
6973246 this may not be a culmination but only step one
6973247 if you dont stop this kind of behaviour it escalates
6973248 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6973249 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
6973250 diese aktionen dienen nicht ernsthaft der stabilisierung der lage in der region
6973251 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6973252 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6973253 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6973254 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6973255 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6973256 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6973257 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6973258 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6973259 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6973260 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6973261 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6973262 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6973263 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6973264 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6973265 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6973266 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6973267 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6973268 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6973269 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6973270 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6973271 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6973272 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6973273 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6973274 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6973275 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6973276 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6973277 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6973278 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6973279 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6973280 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6973281 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6973282 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6973283 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6973284 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6973285 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6973286 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6973287 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6973288 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6973289 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6973290 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6973291 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6973292 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6973293 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6973294 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6973295 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6973296 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6973297 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6973298 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6973299 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6973300 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6973301 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6973302 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6973303 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6973304 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6973305 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6973306 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6973307 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6973308 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6973309 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6973310 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6973311 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6973312 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6973313 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6973314 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6973315 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6973316 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6973317 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6973318 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6973319 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6973320 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6973321 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6973322 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6973323 we have never been in a situation so severe never ever before
6973324 the current situation is unprecedented as nearly the whole country is in crisis
6973325 how can your english be so good do they teach english in pakistan
6973326 are the women allowed to go out of the houses in your country
6973327 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6973328 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6973329 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6973330 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6973331 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6973332 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6973333 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6973334 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6973335 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6973336 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6973337 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6973338 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6973339 this is a planning took where all things are going
6973340 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6973341 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6973342 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6973343 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

6973351 el gobierno desv a la presi n hacia spanair ante la cr tica de las v ctimas
6973352 el gobierno culpa a spanair de mala informaci n durante las primeras horas
6973353 se une ahora la falta de informaci n de spanair y del gobierno hacia las familias de las v ctimas que se lamentaban ayer de que dos d as despu s del fatal accidente siguen sin disponer de una explicaci n veros mil de lo que sucedi en la pista de barajas
6973354 spanair no s lo no ha estado a la altura de sus responsabilidades sino que ha practicado un secretismo que ha molestado incluso al mismo gobierno al que no facilit ning n tipo de informaci n en las horas siguientes a la cat strofe
6973355 especialmente lamentable fue la comparecencia de sus directivos que se limit a una serie de vaguedades que s lo sirvi para acentuar el enfado de los familiares de las v ctimas
6973356 tiene un importante papel que jugar a la hora de impulsar la investigaci n y ayudar a los perjudicados
6973357 deben facilitar sin demora toda la informaci n de la que dispongan a los familiares de las v ctimas que est n en su derecho a saber
6973358 los pol ticos han entrado en escena de una manera protagonista
6973359 muchas v ctimas se est n quejando del trato recibido y de la falta de informaci n en la identificaci n de los fallecidos
6973360 critic la gesti n de spanair en la misma l nea que el gobierno ha lanzado sus insinuaciones
6973361 no se queden en mera t ctica preventiva de imagen es necesario que el ejecutivo y los departamentos competentes dispongan los medios materiales y humanos necesarios para que la comisi n t cnica y el juzgado de instrucci n que investiga los hechos cumplan con su cometido con rigor y rapidez
6973362 se parapetan tras un escudo de evasivas que no hace otra cosa que crispar m s los nimos
6973363 han hecho todos los gestos que est n en su mano para demostrar que no se eluden responsabilidades pero en las ltimas horas se ha entrado en una din mica de acusaciones veladas hacia la compa a y de muestras de cierta descoordinaci n entre las distintas administraciones que en nada contribuyen a calmar los nimos
6973364 se debe mantener una actitud de transparencia informativa que no siembre dudas o alimente conclusiones err neas
6973365 tambi n es necesario que desde la administraci n se den muestras de que se intensifican los controles y mecanismos de inspecci n para garantizar la seguridad en el transporte a reo

6973367 es probable que en el curso de la negociaci n con icv haya pagado gran parte del coste pol tico que pretend a ahorrarse

6973371 todo lo que contribuya a mantener los puentes del di logo entre el govern y el gobierno central debe ser saludado de manera positiva aunque hay que insistir en la necesidad de que los partidos catalanes hablen con una sola voz para evitar confusiones
6973372 debe recomponer su unidad interna y deben rehacerse tambi n las complicidades con ciu aprovechando la pr rroga de tres meses que el gabinete de zapatero ha puesto sobre la mesa

6973374 las posibilidades de que el pib del tercer trimestre no pase de cero son muy elevadas
6973375 el esfuerzo para mejorar la calidad debe venir de la oferta complementaria y de un mejor trato al cliente para ello hace falta personal de hosteler a m s formado lo cual implica que est mucho mejor pagado y en cantidad suficiente

6973390 we learned a lot about them and they no doubt learned a lot about us
6973391 it hasnt sunk in yet theres probably been too much focus on the importance of the game this week
6973392 the two points is far more important than it being jason and myselfs last game at win stadium
6973393 i think when i have a little quiet moment to myself there will be thoughts i think good memories rather than sadness
6973394 were one of the better defensive sides in the comp and where we have struggled a little bit has been our attack
6973395 ben rogers is a points player and last week he showed he can definitely add something to our team
6973396 we still have to work in that area were maybe defending a bit too much maybe coughing up too much ball
6973397 were having to really be desperate on defence when we can ease the pressure a bit by holding on to the ball and getting down their end
6973398 it was almost sad to see grossman enter the game and do almost nothing then get wildly booed by the crowd
6973399 this wasnt anything different than what weve seen in the past
6973400 it the foul on griffiths was outside the box i think everybody saw that was clear
6973401 i think every time we get this referee we just have a bit of bad luck you know so thats unfortunate
6973402 i wasnt in charge then since ive been in charge anyway i wont say it i wont get myself into trouble i cant afford a fine we are not allowed to say anything
6973403 i dont know where the four minutes of stoppage time came from and then he stopped time for the last minute
6973404 the players are gutted they all felt where did the four minutes come from and then it extended it felt like six minutes in the end where that came from we dont know bitterly disappointed
6973405 weve picked up a point it should have been three theres no denying that fact and i think newcastle found themselves very lucky today
6973406 realistically after the first half the game should have been dead and buried we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal
6973407 but it tends to be a situation that when you are not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6973408 we just need to have a bit more of an awareness

6973435 swastiks partnership has resulted in transforming our call center services from 25 seats into a 300 plus delivery center serving top clients

6973454 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure

6973458 that the department of health and human services funds do not support coercive or discriminatory policies or practices
6973459 simply because they adhere to life affirming patient protecting standards of medical ethics such as the hippocratic oath if current trends of coercion are allowed to continue patients will not be able to find physicians who share their life affirming values
6973460 the recent all out campaign by those who oppose conscience rights to muzzle these hhs regulations actually has served to highlight the need for the regulations
6973461 their comments have demonstrated the poisonous hostile and intolerant environment they have created for healthcare professionals who practice medicine according to life honoring standards of ethics
6973462 we must defeat this new rule in order to ensure access to accurate comprehensive health care including birth control and abortion services for every person who wants and needs it
6973463 receive a massive influx of our tax dollars to expand their deceptive operations and to attract hundreds of thousands of women who think theyll be getting medical care but instead will receive a large dose of anti choice ideology
6973464 clearly abortion advocates do not believe in the right to choose if the choice is not to participate in abortion or provide drugs that can take the life of a human being
6973465 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
6973466 we have observed these abuses the festival will be used to correct these abuses observed in the way our female members dress some songs that our choirs sing and in the celebration mass some bishops have frowned at these things and have decided that we should find a way of addressing the issues
6973467 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest
6973468 this is another opportunity for us as joint stakeholders in nation building to collaborate and ensure the success of the festival in question
6973469 it will not only bring out cultural features and arts that can be of liturgical benefit to the catholic church but also showcase the moral values of our culture and people to the world

6973727 the ones that really appealed to me were those that also told a bit of story about the relationship
6973728 i knew that i wanted to include the letters that were in the film which include one from napoleon to josephine and another from beethoven apart from that i had free reign
6973729 i think that was a real peak in letter writing
6973730 although admittedly im sure a lot havent survive from before that
6973731 in the introduction i say that i felt many letters were written for the benefit of the writer rather than the recipient and that some of them seemed to have grown out of the convention for making declarations of love rather than deep passion with some men theres an awful lot of self servingness a sense of look at how great i am and youre lucky enough to be receiving my prose thats why the title love letters of great men is slightly tongue in cheek
6973732 in my case the anguish of absence is so great that it would be intolerable were it not for the firm hope i have of your indissoluble affection towards me in order to remind you of it i sent you the thing which comes nearest that is possible my picture
6973733 henrys so interested in anne that he sends her a picture of himself the letters i really like are those that tell the real story
6973734 while hes commanding armies and revolutionising military strategy hes also chasing josephine all over europe
6973735 i rush into your apartment i have left everything to see you to press you in my arms you were not there your husband is very very unhappy
6973736 you dont have to be a great writer to writer a great love letter
6973737 sincerity will always shine through you can always tell if it comes from the heart
6973738 i think its so tragic that he cant find his own voice in the end he does send her a short email saying youre the one but obviously hes completely lacking in confidence about being able to express himself and i just think theres something very sad about that
6973739 throughout the letters there is a lot of wailing and plenty of expressions of anguish desperation and suffering this book is not about simple happiness its about the rollercoaster ride of being in love which can often be painful doing research for this book has made me realise that nothing really changes people will always fall in love and go through all these emotions no matter what century they live in
6973740 you know i would with pleasure give up all here and beyond the grave for you
6973741 unlovely objects are all around me excepting thee the charms of all the world appear to be translated by thee
6973742 tell me that you are well tell me that you little son is well then tell me that your very dog if you have one is well defraud me of no one thing that pleases you for whatever that is it will please me better than anything else can do
6973743 do catch them in the air those 2999 1 2 little kisses from me which are flying about waiting for someone to snap them up
6973744 oh phoebe i want thee much thou art the only person in the world that ever was necessary to me other people have occasionally been more or less agreeable but i think i was always more at ease alone than in anybodys company til i knew thee
6973745 but the time will come when you will sigh for any heart that could be fond then you will recall to your memory the passionate heart you have forfeited and the genius you have betrayed
6973746 id be only too happy if she deign sometimes to cast a pitying look upon her slave
6973747 for myself i have been a martyr the whole time i appeal to you by the blood of that christ you believe in do not write to me if you have done anything this month which it would have pained me to have seen

6973759 when sheila and steven came from the hospital that first week we had just one crib the second one hadnt come yet and i looked at both of them in there and i just said oh my god ive got charlie brown and lucy steven was just so sweet it was like he had peanut butter stuck to the roof of his mouth and sheila she wanted a queen dom now

6973762 if you had told me id only fence four victories i wouldve said thats impossible no one can do that poorly ive had days almost this bad throughout the few years but this was absolutely the worst
6973763 i dont think she really expected me to say anything but were both so supportive of each other and i wanted her to be doing well so badly i really felt for her
6973764 ive learned a lot through this before this day there couldve been a good argument of was this worth it and now i dont have a medal but i can definitely tell you its worth it
6973765 i didnt walk off like i hadnt walked away all three years of this and im so thankful because it ended on the most beautiful note

6973788 i couldnt go downstairs and stand up and try to cook at all costs people with aids need to eat because theyll go down very very quickly
6973789 they come here for the socializing and the community as much as the food
6973790 people should never have to choose between food and medicine
6973791 if thats the case logic tells me were going to have a domino effect
6973792 attitudes towards drinking and driving throughout the eastern bay of plenty need to change

6973794 having scored such a hit at previous ibm and blackpool conventions with his vampire and dove act we were thrilled to discover that rafael has three other stage pieces unseen in england that he will be performing over the weekend
6973795 said noel britten who books the acts for the convention
6973796 you think that you should try getting maria out the door in time for school on a monday
6973797 very droll ill be more specific whats it like in outer space
6973798 no i mean it its just so incomparably huge thats the first thing you notice
6973799 well thats some relief and here i was worrying that travel to the stars meant finding out all about how tiny and insignificant alan jackson is
6973800 quite the opposite in fact because coming back means putting everything back into perspective looking at the world with new eyes seeing everything as larger than life
6973801 ooh there was a button on that one wasnt there
6973802 i wonder if ill ever see what youve seen out there all those stars and planets and civilisations
6973803 no but on the whole it truly was wonderful it was it was like waking up in a whole new life every day different and new and full of things you could see a thousand times over and never get bored and youd look up sometimes and thered be twelve suns in the sky and youd wonder if people ever slept there if it ever got dark enough and then youd wonder whether the people had to sleep at all and youd start to think what that would be like never having to sleep its an infinity of possibilities and its realising that no matter how far you may go no matter how many wonderful things you see youll still only be glimpsing a fraction of a sliver of whats really out there
6973804 the fact that there are worlds and worlds out there to explore and i would walk away from them in an instant if it meant a night like this one a wonderful ordinary night like this one
6973805 most people wouldnt call waiting up for their alien invasion repelling children ordinary
6973806 every night so many times so easily the man who couldnt die how
6973807 it has to end i cant go on not much longer tell me how do you do it
6973808 go back where you came from theres no game no ones making you stay
6973809 quick how long has this been happening how many times
6973810 ten maybe something like that every night for a week at least
6973811 you heard the man everyone out theres been an accident lets give them some air thats it come on
6973812 hey if you want to watch someone die im three stages over at quarter to nine free admission if you show your ticket for koshey
6973813 just a bit more master and then ah there you are go to sleep now
6973814 do you have a cloak or a blanket he should be wrapped
6973815 just gave him a bit of my artron energy a few more minutes and ill be although i dont suppose you have a cup of tea
6973816 like i said just give me a few minutes and ill be fine
6973817 i believe i know what happens next unfortunately hard to believe hed go to such lengths on his own do you know did someone goad him into this
6973818 id best be off nice job with the crowd control there by the way whats your name
6973819 you shouldnt exist according to all the laws of you shouldnt be possible
6973820 of course hed fixate on you and hes always been so obsessed with death that
6973821 for what its worth though you seem quite nice as impossible things go
6973822 youll give me the mother of all headaches good luck with your problem ah james was it
6973823 im looking for a jet boat i need an ambulance so then i came forward and then i picked up the microphone and starting talking to her
6973824 this happen up there and you just cant pass it by
6973825 youve got to jump in there and do what you can because youre kind of isolated
6973826 onaanvaardbaar want het zal me ervan weerhouden mijn verdediging voor te bereiden en te voeren
6973827 go on in ill be with you in a moment
6973828 you dont have to play any games i know why youre here just give me the damned thing you can watch me take it
6973829 i dont have anything to say i dont want to talk about it i do not want to listen to you just give me the goddamned pill and then get the fuck out of here
6973830 ive had time to think gotten a little distance and ive come to the conclusion that you only made one mistake just one in the whole business
6973831 i on the other hand made two the mistake you made was out of inexperience i dont have that excuse
6973832 you thought that the little pieces of lisa that were left floating around in the mind of that monster meant that she was still there and that there was still hope that was your mistake
6973833 mostly just memories ianto the point is that if you had more experience you would have known that the only thing you could have done for lisa once the conversion process started was to put a bullet between her eyes
6973834 but you didnt know that there was no way you could know that
6973835 i hope i would have had the courage to do same thing if i were in your position
6973836 except i would never have the patience and self discipline to hold things together as long as you did
6973837 i knew when i hired you that something was wrong
6973838 what would you have done if youd found out about lisa back then
6973839 id have put her down as quickly and painlessly as possible and then retconned you
6973840 the second mistake no calling it a mistake is too self serving it wasnt a mistake a mistake means unintended consequences and i meant this this was just wrong i should never have ordered you to kill her
6973841 i can use the excuse that you had completely blindsided me that i felt betrayed and scared but the truth is that that is no excuse i did it to hurt you and for no other reason
6973842 i have a problem with my temper always have had i let it get me then i am so sorry
6973843 damn you why are you here why are you doing this
6973844 do you get some kind of sick thrill from acting like this from from acting like you really care if i forgive you or whose fault it was or or anything
6973845 im not acting i am truly sorry and i do hope you can forgive me someday
6973846 someday i wont remember who the hell you are ten minutes after you leave here so why should you care
6973847 i am not going to retcon you ianto i want you to come back to work
6973848 we need you ianto i need you you made a mistake out of love given that mistake you did your best to handle the situation and you didnt do badly at all
6973849 and i finally got a chance to see who you really are you showed me your determination your resourcefulness your capacity for loyalty and your courage i do not consider those traits grounds for dismissal
6973850 no you did not their deaths were a consequence of your actions yes you are partially responsible yes but you did not kill them it was the cyberman that is what they do ianto they kill people you do not
6973851 you will have to carry some of the responsibility for their deaths and i know believe me i know how hard that will be but you did not kill them ianto
6973852 i know you were used to thinking of that thing as lisa you cared for her and kept her alive and hid her from those who would have destroyed her and now you think the woman that you loved the woman you had sacrificed so much to save discarded you like a piece of garbage and killed those people nearly killed all of us
6973853 but it wasnt lisa it wasnt lisa ianto you need to understand that it wasnt lisa
6973854 lisa died in london eighteen months ago ianto she was never here
6973855 there were bits of lisa left in the mind of that monster just bits and it used those bits to manipulate you to make you care for it keep it alive
6973856 and there seemed to be enough of her left that the input from those fragments confused the cyberman brain you were right the conversion wasnt complete or it would not have been so confused but those memories were not her ianto lisa was dead lisa died in the battle the lie you told me that first time you brought me coffee was the truth after all
6973857 we still have the job to do ianto i think it is worthy of doing more than that it is a necessity i know that we can do it better if you are with us i know you have a lot to sort through
6973858 and i know you can never forgive me for what i had to do
6973859 i understand that ill be sorry about it but i understand but the job ianto i need your help with that i believe we have a duty i think you believe that too
6973860 i forgave you while i was standing in the door of the storage room while that thing made use of a memory stolen from lisas brain to try to regain control of you when i realized what it had been doing to you all these months why you did what you did i forgave you then ianto
6973861 we cant make it not have happened but we can start again if we try hard enough we can start again i want to try ianto i hope you will want that too come back when you are ready well be waiting

6973945 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals

6973983 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6973984 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6973985 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6973986 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6973987 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6973988 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6973989 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6973990 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6973991 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6973992 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6973993 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6973994 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet

6974010 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6974011 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6974012 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents

6974023 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6974024 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6974025 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6974026 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6974027 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6974028 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6974029 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
6974030 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6974031 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6974032 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6974033 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6974034 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
6974035 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
6974036 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
6974037 betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
6974038 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
6974039 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
6974040 every seat will be a great seat as we listen to barack obama communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the challenges americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
6974041 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6974042 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6974043 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6974044 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6974045 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6974046 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
6974047 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6974048 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6974049 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6974050 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6974051 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6974052 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6974053 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6974054 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6974055 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6974056 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6974057 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6974058 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6974059 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6974060 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6974061 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6974062 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6974063 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6974064 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6974065 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6974066 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6974067 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6974068 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6974069 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6974070 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
6974071 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6974072 he hasnt demonstrated it yet this is early in the campaign
6974073 probably the most under qualified person since george bush to seek the presidency
6974074 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6974075 i deeply regret any offense my remark might have caused anyone
6974076 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent its a point im not joking
6974077 we were totally cut off said beaubien a two time stanford all american
6974078 tonight was for the 99 times they have beaten us
6974079 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6974080 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6974081 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6974082 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6974083 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6974084 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6974085 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6974086 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6974087 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6974088 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6974089 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6974090 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6974091 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6974092 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6974093 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6974094 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6974095 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6974096 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6974097 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6974098 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6974099 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6974100 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6974101 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6974102 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6974103 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6974104 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6974105 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6974106 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6974107 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6974108 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6974109 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6974110 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6974111 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6974112 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6974113 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6974114 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6974115 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6974116 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6974117 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6974118 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6974119 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6974120 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6974121 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6974122 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6974123 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6974124 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6974125 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6974126 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6974127 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6974128 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6974129 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6974130 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6974131 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6974132 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6974133 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6974134 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6974135 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6974136 its what you have to do in order to have a chance against the usa
6974137 if you try to go showtime against them that wont work because thats what they want to do and they do it better
6974138 but its a long shot for spain i dont want to say something that will make me look stupid its a basketball game so anything can happen but the usa is playing really good
6974139 combines technical ability physicality and discipline which they did not show in previous tournaments
6974140 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo

6974142 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6974143 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6974144 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6974145 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6974146 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6974147 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6974148 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6974149 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6974150 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6974151 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6974152 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6974153 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6974154 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6974155 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6974156 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6974157 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6974158 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6974159 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6974160 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6974161 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6974162 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6974163 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6974164 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6974165 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6974166 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6974167 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6974168 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6974169 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6974170 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6974171 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6974172 they told me there are going to be resources here
6974173 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6974174 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6974175 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6974176 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6974177 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6974178 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6974179 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6974180 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6974181 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6974182 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6974183 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6974184 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6974185 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6974186 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6974187 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6974188 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6974189 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6974190 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6974191 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6974192 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6974193 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6974194 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6974195 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6974196 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6974197 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6974198 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6974199 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6974200 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6974201 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6974202 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6974203 do you guys have the playbook from the 11 or 12 games its 12 joe were going to play
6974204 if you gave me that i could probably tell you what were going to do were going to play it by ear
6974205 we might end up with two tight ends and two running backs
6974206 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6974207 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6974208 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6974209 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6974210 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6974211 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6974212 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6974213 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6974214 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6974215 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6974216 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6974217 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6974218 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6974219 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6974220 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6974221 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6974222 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6974223 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6974224 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6974225 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6974226 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6974227 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6974228 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6974229 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6974230 while you were sleeping the world changed in an instant
6974231 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6974232 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6974233 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6974234 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6974235 as soon as i dropped the camera i looked around everywhere and there was nothing in the sky
6974236 it was miles and miles away and as big as a football
6974237 it wasnt there when i took the camera away from my eye but it was there when i took the photo
6974238 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is
6974239 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit

6974246 wat is vrede voor het merendeel van de mensen doet dit woord
6974247 oh man i need to tell you about this dream i had last night
6974248 well i was standing in the middle of this big room and there were these little ufos flying around they looked just like marvin the martians ufo from the bugs bunny cartoon hey are you listening to me
6974249 so anyway these ufos were like buzzing my head like little flies and then next thing i know im standing at the new york stock exchange in my boxers getting ready to ring the bell and my whole high school graduating class is hey did you hear that part
6974250 why do you waste your money on that silly lottery
6974251 because i think i would enjoy getting a check for a couple hundred million dollars
6974252 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
6974253 a penguin in your hand is worth two penguins in the bush

6974255 one bird in your hand is worth two bushes in the white house
6974256 the historicity of the book of mormon record is crucial we cannot exercise faith in that which is untrue nor can doctrinal fiction have normative value in our lives only scripture writings and events and descriptions from real people at a real point in time people who were moved upon and directed by divine powers can serve as a revelatory channel enabling us to hear and feel the word of god
6974257 record of gods dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the americas
6974258 an abridgment of the record of the people of nephi and also of the lamanite written to the lamanites which are a remnant of the house of israel
6974259 that the title page of the book of mormon is a literal translation taken from the very last leaf on the left hand side of the collection or book of plates which contained the record which has been translated the language of the whole running the same as all hebrew writing in general and that said title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other mans who has lived or does live in this generation
6974260 the son of lehi who came out of the land of jerusalem who was a descendant of manasseh
6974261 the lamanites now a down trodden people are a remnant of the house of israel the curse of god has followed them as it has done the jews though the jews have not been darkened in their skin as have the lamanites
6974262 the nephites suffered extinction about 400 a d but the lamanites lived on in their degraded course and are today extant upon the land as the american indians
6974263 not only in the book of mormon are the descendants of lehi called jews but also in the doctrine and covenants
6974264 the book of mormon tells that a small band of israelites under lehi migrated from jerusalem to the western hemisphere about 600 b c upon lehis death his family divided into two opposing factions one under lehis oldest son laman see lamanites and the other under a younger son nephi
6974265 perhaps it can be anticipated that before long some scholar will examine the dna of early inhabitants of eastern siberia and the dna of early american indians for confirmation of their relationship all that would be left would be for an interested mormon to compare the two findings to the dna of israelites who lived about 600 b c e
6974266 so far dna research has lent no support to the traditional mormon beliefs about the origins of native americans instead genetic data have confirmed that migrations from asia are the primary source of american indian origins
6974267 while dna shows that ultimately all human populations are closely related to date no intimate genetic link has been found between ancient israelites and indigenous americans much less within the time frame suggested in the book of mormon
6974268 i dont think there is one iota of evidence that suggests a lost tribe from israel made it all the way to the new world it is a great story slain by ugly fact
6974269 work shows that amerisraelite lamanites could not possibly have been the principle ancestors of the american indians as claimed in the current introduction to the book of mormon
6974270 who have substantiated crawfords conclusion through agreement that the indian gene pool is siberian not middle eastern
6974271 farms has played a role in offering revisionist interpretations that seek to reconcile faith with science but the dna research may make this effort more difficult as the views of intellectuals and those of traditional mormons continue to diverge
6974272 the most recent mitochondrial dna study demonstrated that there were three known separate migrations to the new world one certainly connected to siberian peoples the other thought to be asian among amerindians samples were taken in canada the united states and peru none were taken in mesoamerica where most lds scholars believe the story of the book of mormon took place
6974273 while farms researchers are careful to note the importance of cultural influences on the construction of categories they express confidence in an israelite genetic presence in central america and perhaps as far away as arizona to the north and colombia to the south as we have seen genetic studies of indigenous peoples throughout north central and south america have failed to link native americans from these locations to ancient hebrews
6974274 we have an active research project addressing some of these questions but most of the data is still too preliminary to make any hard conclusions most of all the evidence to date would point to asian populations as the source of at least the great majority of contemporary native american gene pool
6974275 that the americas were moderately populated at the time of arrival of the lehi group the jaredites and any other group that may have come from the middle east
6974276 believes that the presence or absence of genetic linkages to the near east in the americas is neither proof nor disproof of the book of mormon
6974277 it would not surprise woodward if geneticists ultimately failed to find any traces of mtdna mitochondrial dna from lehis party jaredites or mulekites
6974278 genetic research particularly that using mitochondrial and y chromosome markers provide quite emphatic refutation of any such relationship between jews and native americans
6974279 now what do we as mormons do weve got a problem our beliefs are not validated by the science
6974280 let me repose a question that tom has put to us is there scientific evidence based in molecular biology to substantiate the statement in the introduction to the book of mormon that lamanites are the principle ancestors of american indians the answer is no
6974281 the mistake of overreaching the mistake of saying we know more than we know
6974282 about mistakes that were held by people decades ago without trying to understand the context in which they made those statements
6974283 the idea that america may have been overwhelmingly peopled by folks from northeastern asia is perfectly compatible
6974284 as biologists we accept the published data dealing with native american origins and view those data as reasonably representing american asian connections
6974285 the data accumulated to date indicate that 99 6 percent of native american genetic markers studied so far exhibit siberian connections
6974286 there has been little if any evidence seriously considered by the mainstream scientific community that would indicate a middle east origin or any other source of origin for the majority of contemporary native americans
6974287 we propose that book of mormon is the account of a small group of people who lived on the american continent interacting to some degree with the indigenous population but relatively isolated from the general historical events occurring elsewhere in the americas
6974288 that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the lord
6974289 and behold it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations for behold many nations would overrun the land that there would be no place for an inheritance wherefore i lehi have obtained a promise that inasmuch as those whom the lord god shall bring out of the land of jerusalem shall keep his commandments they shall prosper upon the face of this land and they shall be kept from all other nations that they may possess this land unto themselves and if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land and there shall be none to molest them nor to take away the land of their inheritance
6974290 other nations unto them and he will give unto them power and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten
6974291 when lehis party arrived in the land did they find others there
6974292 how then could lehis prophecy about other nations being brought in have been kept long in abeyance after that
6974293 the early nephites generally did the same thing within a few centuries
6974294 the lord took every precaution to see that nothing might interfere with this posterity of joseph in working out their god given destiny and the destiny of america he provided and so told lehi at the very beginning of his settlement that it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations for behold many nations would overrun the land that there would be no place for an inheritance 2 nephi 1 8 the lord so kept the land for a thousand years after lehi landed he so kept it in his wisdom for another thousand years after the nephites were destroyed perhaps to give the lamanitish branch another chance
6974295 came out from jerusalem at the time that zedekiah king of judah was carried away captive into babylon
6974296 chances are extremely high that at least some and perhaps a majority of modern day native americans are descended from the jaredites and would have asian blood and of course brother murphys writings and public comments virtually ignore the jaredites
6974297 hints at an epic genre rooted in the ancient near east
6974298 all of the people upon all of the face of the land who had not been slain
6974299 men women and children being armed with weapons of war
6974300 discovered by the people of zarahemla and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons
6974301 and if the lord somehow did not at those times bring in other nations then surely he would have done so after cumorah 1100 years prior to columbus
6974302 following the close of nephite recorded history mongolians vikings and perhaps small groups of wanderers from other lands came to the americas and intermarried to a greater or less extent with the descendants of book of mormon peoples their posterity constituted the numerous aboriginal tribes found in the new world by the europeans
6974303 and it came to pass that they did multiply and spread and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth from the sea south to the sea north from the sea west to the sea east
6974304 no one knows the details of book of mormon geography but the prophet joseph smith revealed some information that suggests that at some time in their history the spread of the nephites unto the land northward included what we know today as north america
6974305 the whole face of the land had become covered with buildings and the people were as numerous almost as it were the sand of the sea
6974306 neither the nephites nor the jaredites repented when rivers of blood flowed on their battlefields and millions of their number were slain by the sword
6974307 the history of this american continent also gives evidence that the lamanites have risen up in their anger and vexed the gentiles this warfare may not be over it has been the fault of people in the united states to think that this prophetic saying has reference to the indians in the united states but we must remember that there are millions of the remnant in mexico central and south america
6974308 we therefore cast a glance southward into old mexico and through the great countries beyond down through central america and south america where there are millions and millions of lamanites direct descendants of father lehi
6974309 about twenty five centuries ago a hardy group left the comforts of a great city crossed a desert braved an ocean and came to the shores of this their promised land there were two large families those of lehi and ishmael who in not many centuries numbered hundreds of millions of people on these two american continents
6974310 lamanites share a royal heritage i should like to address my remarks to you our kinsmen of the isles of the sea and the americas millions of you have blood relatively unmixed with gentile nations
6974311 how do you lose the genetic link of millions of people who allegedly have not mixed their blood with another culture
6974312 here let me say again according to the book of mormon many of those great islands that are found in the indian ocean also in the great pacific sea have been planted with colonies of israelites do they not resemble each other go to the sandwich islands to the south sea islands to japan go to the various islands of the pacific ocean and you find a general resemblance in the characters and countenances of the people who are they according to the book of mormon israelites were scattered forth from time to time and colonies planted on these islands of the ocean
6974313 bless thy saints in this great land and those from other lands who will use this temple most have in their veins the blood of father lehi
6974314 thou kind and gracious father our hearts swell with gratitude for thy remembrance of the sons and daughters of lehi we thank thee o god for lifting the scales of darkness which for generations clouded the vision of the descendants of lehi
6974315 bless thy saints that they may continue to live here without molestation may they live in peace and security may they be prospered as they cultivate their farms and pursue their vocations may the sons and daughters of father lehi grow in strength and in fulfillment of the ancient promises made concerning them
6974316 it has been a very interesting thing to see the descendants of father lehi in the congregation that have gathered in the temple so very many of these people have the blood of lehi in their veins and it is just an intriguing thing to see their tremendous response and their tremendous interest
6974317 we invoke thy blessings upon this nation of mexico where so many of the sons and daughters of father lehi dwell
6974318 may thy eternal purposes concerning the sons and daughters of lehi be realized in this sacred house may every blessing of the eternal gospel be poured out upon them and may the suffering of the centuries be softened through the beneficence of thy loving care

6974326 i am ashamed to call myself a democrat in the city of lorain tonight we are supposed to be the party of the working class people and here we are turning down jobs for working class people
6974327 the bottom line is this caught everybody off guard no one anticipated a guilty verdict
6974328 lorains chief building official was arrested friday on charges of bribery and dereliction of duty
6974329 the national retailers are looking at this area and seeing it has tremendous potential for not only profits but market share
6974330 i dont think of retail as saving our job market but it does help make lorain a more attractive community to locate in

6974344 its a white building beside norling near the main traffic
6974345 yes in front of the lugar theatre you cant miss it
6974346 but people confuse the colour of things and say its in a yellow building when its white
6974347 i called my friend to wait on the road when i couldnt find his new apartment
6974348 i said its opposite taj above the road gave the name and told them to walk along that was the only landmark i could think of and if i went into details i would end up confusing them
6974349 his cell was switched off and even though we asked the drivers who drop him off we were still not able to locate his place
6974350 all the drivers we spoke to said yellow building near the rapa hall but when its dark and the areas not lit up you cant really make out the colour of a building
6974351 the only direction they gave me was a white building above the chorten with a white car parked in front
6974352 we need street names and house numbers if we are to deliver letters at home
6974353 it was never used because people used the post boxes at bhutan post and they never thought that a home address was required
6974354 it would have worked had the post office got rid of its post box facilities
6974355 this is a really revolting case and it turns the stomach what we have heard
6974356 i was struggling and i spent my savings on the dogs and tried to get them new homes
6974357 when i was told amy had the same results in the same subjects i couldnt believe it it still hasnt sunk in
6974358 weve both done really well much better than we expected to do
6974359 our parents and the rest of our family are really pleased
6974360 we understand that because we look just the same people get us mixed up
6974361 we have the same friends and enjoy the same activities like sports but we dont spend all our time together and think in exactly the same ways
6974362 well both be studying physical education and a btec award in sport
6974363 alex is determined to become a gym instructor whereas i would like to do something within sport but im not sure what yet
6974364 but if things continue like they are were both destined to end up working in the same place doing the same thing
6974365 in all cases non british applicants must have resided within the uk for a three year period immediately prior to their vetting application for a non police personal vetting clearance
6974366 to ensure that vetting is carried out in a fair and non discriminatory way the residency requirement also applies to uk residents who have been absent for an extended period during the preceding three years
6974367 i have always wanted to be a policewoman but when i came back in may i found that gmp were not recruiting
6974368 i decided to try for a police staff job instead i applied for the position of project assistant and the letter arrived i was excited as i thought it was calling me for an interview now i dont know what to do for the next three years
6974369 i did do a bit of research to check it on the internet and i found some information on the home office website which said some groups were exempt from the rule it gave the example of backpackers who have been away for between six and 12 months i can only assume that if i had come back earlier i would have been ok
6974370 i know there have to be rules but this is political correctness gone mad
6974371 national vetting policy states anyone applying for a job with the police service must have been a resident here for at least three consecutive years
6974372 this requirement is in order to meet the stringent vetting procedures which all gmp staff must be subject to
6974373 it was amazing even after i had withdrawn the money for myself i could still hardly believe it
6974374 i went for a drink at a bar on the same street and heard what was happening from a friend i met there
6974375 people at the cash machine were texting everyone they knew to tell them about it
6974376 by 8pm there were about 30 or 40 people queuing to use the cashpoint and about the same number standing watching
6974377 i was in the bar and people were talking about it when i asked what was going on i couldnt believe it
6974378 i went across the road but i was a bit apprehensive because i thought it was a wind up
6974379 i only had 30 in my account it is not a lot but it certainly helped
6974380 i can confirm that an incident took place involving one of our automatic telling machines dispensing the wrong notes
6974381 we will not be pursuing people to return the cash
6974382 i had been struggling with the guy in the kitchen and he pushed me down but then i got up and socked him one on the jaw just like ricky hatton hes the man isnt he
6974383 i then went through to the bedroom and found my wife barbara with her head all bleeding i began shouting for the police and the pair ran off
6974384 i wasnt frightened and i dont feel brave i hit him because i was angry and it was instinct my main worry was for my wife
6974385 mr ratcliffe had something about him and he behaved with great courage and fortitude in a very difficult situation
6974386 it is really nice to feel this guy has been inspired by me i am so glad it turned out well for him you have to admire his guts having a go but i would not recommend this for everyone because there are some nasty people out there
6974387 i am in the us at the moment but am back next week and ill invite him to my gym there might be some nice surprises for him
6974388 the last time research was done it was valued that it was worth 17 5m and that was two years ago we would expect it to be more than that
6974389 we certainly know that this weekend many of the hotels bars and restaurants will be full because of the number of people who travel to manchester for the pride event
6974390 this is one of the citys pillar events and one that has been identified as being important to the brand of manchester because of what it says about manchester
6974391 manchester pride is a great showcase for the city attracting people nationally and internationally
6974392 businesses will benefit during this time as people coming for the weekend will spend in restaurants and shops while they are here
6974393 a lot of retailers are planning special promotions because they know the strength of the pink pound it will bring people into the city and they will come back
6974394 as the years have gone by the parade has grown and it has really enhanced manchesters reputation as a welcoming and fun place not just in britain but in europe and beyond
6974395 clearly the more people who come and visit manchester and enjoy themselves the better it is for the economy but the real benefit isnt just economic
6974396 the number of people enquiring about emigrating is up by about 25 per cent this year and manchester is right at the top of list
6974397 were getting more enquiries from the north west than anywhere else
6974398 its been a pretty dreadful summer and with the credit crunch people are looking at the fantastic alternative lifestyle in places like australia
6974399 were just sick of the british weather its miserable so were heading down the west coast of france and then onto spain and portugal
6974400 there are many great things about this country but were looking for somewhere with the sun and the sea
6974401 were planning to go for a year but if we find somewhere we like we might settle there
6974402 this was a deliberate punch on the ambulance member trying to perform his public duty
6974403 unfortunately these days its increasingly common to get punched kicked and spat at sometimes its because of a medical condition but other people are just aggressive and abusive
6974404 at a minimum the nsg make clear that nuclear trade with india shall be terminated if it resumes testing for any reason
6974405 if india cannot agree to such terms it suggests that india is not serious about its nuclear test moratorium pledge
6974406 a number of nsg states have the common sense and courage to propose some common sense restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india to reduce the risk that such trade will assist indias nuclear bomb programme
6974407 even with the additional conditions and restrictions that were proposed an india specific exemption from nsg rules would be a serious mistake that would blow a hole in the nuclear non proliferation system
6974408 at this point we can expect that washington and new delhi will now try to wordsmith the nsg guideline on india to the point of being meaningless and force a decision at the next nsg meeting
6974409 when ruby came along it made us realise just how few green spaces there are in the city and how much nicer it would be to have little pocket parks in unexpected places
6974410 we have a good residents committee and approached local business
6974411 rain bar and jw lees have been fantastic they own the banking here and agreed we could make changes
6974412 after about a year of meetings and form fillings it is great to see the grass and trees in place now and it does make a difference
6974413 too many sealed surfaces can cause huge drainage problems and the more grass we can get into the city the better
6974414 these guys have been really good to work with and it demonstrates what can be achieved with some ambition and organisation they had to assure the council that they will take care of the site and maintain it which is why careful consideration had to be given to what was done here
6974415 manchester is full of little corners like this which could be improved it does not need to be a huge space a small corner of land or even a gable end can be transformed
6974416 but if every residents association in the city worked like this one who knows the differences that could be made
6974417 to have an entertainment venue so close to the church and open until 1am is something we must tolerate but to have what would effectively be a nightclub open until almost 4am would be intolerable
6974418 we fully accept that we live in a vibrant city where people go out and enjoy themselves and as a restaurant i wish ithaca every success
6974419 but some reason and good sense must prevail and respect should be shown when we are looking at what in effect are the precincts of the church
6974420 we should remember that st marys is unique with a church on this site since 1794
6974421 this has come at a very bad time for me personally i have been waiting since may for heart surgery which is now imminent and it will mean my being in hospital for about a week then months recuperating

6974437 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
6974438 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6974439 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6974440 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6974441 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6974470 im really impressed by the presentation elva adsit did about up and coming national media marketing businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative

6974482 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
6974483 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
6974484 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there

6974493 i am personally committed to a principled and respectful dialogue and engagement with all public officials i will continue to pursue these opportunities but this dialogue cannot simply occur between a bishop and a catholic politician it must occur between the catholic politician and his constituents i call all people of good will in our community to step up their efforts to persuade all public servants that human life is precious and human dignity must be defended while there are few examples over the last 31 years of catholic public servants who have taken an anti life position having a conversion while serving in public office we nonetheless have to continue to try to persuade and engage them in dialogue we commit ourselves to pray daily for them at our masses and to invoke the intercession of st thomas more patron of statesmen and politicians on their behalf

6974642 he hung around with the football players tossed the ball
6974643 bob took him in his bmw and they went around everywhere it was just joyful to see kourtlyn and his face and how he reacted when he got home
6974644 whats impressive its something he doesnt share with other people
6974645 its not a publicity thing its him being who he is he understands he can make an impact on other peoples lives and he takes the time to do that
6974646 its not because he wants the attention or its someone making him its just because
6974647 one morning it was 8 oclock and theres this knock on the door and the door opens and its him stoops has stopped in at the hospital with his own family on thanksgiving mornings and also near christmas
6974648 its pretty neat when you think about it i see a lot of kids at the
6974649 or i see a lot of them that have already had their match and had their transplant and are recovering from it and i know the difference it makes in their lives
6974650 theyll say i have to tell you i dont like
6974651 and hell say well thats ok everybodys got to like somebody and by the end its not even about football its about a friend
6974652 he has this amazing way to remember all their names
6974653 i cant tell you the number of patients and parents who are in the middle of this very stressful thing and they think bob has this special place in his heart just for them
6974654 and he does he just has a way of making them all feel special
6974655 they had all these balloons and stuff i thought oh thats nice the nurses threw a party for me adrian peterson were there i was just baffled they brought out the cake and everything it was pretty awesome
6974656 they were leaving out that thursday afternoon to go to texas
6974657 one of the biggest games of the year always i totally couldnt believe it
6974658 he knew each of the kids by name and that really impressed me hed sit there and talk to them for a little while and not just the kids but the parents its a hard time for the parents too
6974659 it was great to see that kind of a person and to play for that kind of a person ill always take that and know that no matter how busy you get or how famous you get theres always time for other people
6974660 the neat thing is watching him bring his players and teach them how to be a good person too
6974661 i always say im not a big football fan but im a bob stoops fan because of all he does
6974662 they can be in the dumps because theyre up there in the bone marrow unit there for several weeks at a time
6974663 and he can walk in and you can just see it you can feel it
6974664 and the parents are just so grateful because youll do anything for your kid to just feel better
6974665 thats what he tells the kids in the bone marrow clinic
6974666 honestly it gives them something positive to look forward to to do
6974667 someone special who is special to a lot of people who thinks of them as special
6974668 i had one kid who told me except for this cancer thing this has been the best year of my life
6974669 making memories the rooms and halls of childrens hospital are filled with stories some heart wrenching some uplifting stories of pain and suffering and sacrifice coach stoops
6974670 i cant tell you how many times i go and theres the football that hes signed right by the casket or in the slide show there he is with them and how much it means to the families
6974671 he gave me his cell phone number and told me to call if i ever needed anything
6974672 generation but not quite children of the new millennium generation
6974673 because so many of us remain home well into their mid twenties right at the time that our own parents the baby boomers are needing more care

6974675 was revolutionized and got its biggest economic boost in popularity among women and because we are more sexually active it has also lead to a more active awareness of our bodies ie gay men and their hiv aids status
6974676 dude i just met you and you may be my friends best friend but youre a selfish asshole

6974697 i just think john brumby should be here and explaining this to victorians
6974698 hes sent a lot of mixed messages lately he was there in the parliament on thursday patting himself on the back claiming job growth claiming it for the government and when the job losses are announced hes vanished
6974699 they cant send a message that theyre going to back off population growth just a few weeks after theyve been celebrating population growth
6974700 im asking guys on my own staff who arent coming what do i do
6974701 the reason i left was because i knew i was going to be with coach stoops i knew we were going to win
6974702 i like to think i have a pretty good balance on how we work and how we include our families
6974703 its hard to beat that when you can include them and also have success success wise and financially theyve done well those are all important factors in everybodys assessment of jobs
6974704 its the atmosphere and culture he creates he hires guys to do their jobs and lets their families be a part of it
6974705 youd be na ve to believe that goes on everywhere
6974706 that begins with coach stoops where some people will stand for it he pushes and fosters that culture and environment if you get in that situation where family has to take a backseat that puts a lot of stress and strain on everyone involved where here that is never an issue
6974707 i appreciate my little guy running around on the sidelines during a scrimmage or practice its not like this everywhere ive worked in a lot of good places but its not like this everywhere
6974708 i remember when my son would fall asleep on the couch waiting up for me a couple of years ago id pick him up and take him upstairs now i cant get him off the ground and you think wow where did this come from that puts it all in perspective
6974709 ive worked on staffs where the head coachs kids were grown they were out of the house which meant we could stay at the office all night
6974710 you may creat lots of splashes in your life but the wavees that come from those splashes will disturb the peace of all your fellow creatures
6974711 remember that you are responsible for what you put in your circle and that circle will also touch many other circles
6974712 you will need to live in a way that allows the good that comes from your circle to send the peace of that goodness to others the splash that comes from anger or jealously will send those feelings to other circles you are responsible for both

6974715 my friend ive come to listen i want to understand
6974716 do you think mccain is seriously and i mean this professionally flirting with the idea of accepting a second place on the ticket with john kerry and creating a fusion ticket to run against the president
6974717 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along and they dont have fundamental disagreements on major policies
6974718 i think around the anniversary we get edgy and i think were edgy right now and i think well get past it
6974719 we think this can have devastating impacts on our ocean ecosystem
6974720 the ocean ecosystem can no longer handle all this excess co2
6974721 this corrosive ocean acidified water has come on to our continental shelf years 50 to 100 years before we ever thought it would be occurring
6974722 saltwater fish are delicate and they need a stable environment
6974723 now with acidification thats going to make it harder for animals to deposit a skeleton they cant put that shell down they cant grow theyre going to go extinct
6974724 it will change 150 percent by the end of this century
6974725 global warming and acidification are damaging the phytoplankton at the basis of the oceans enormous food web putting the entire biosphere in jeopardy

6974728 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
6974729 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
6974730 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
6974731 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6974732 the white house isnt a place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power
6974733 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
6974734 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6974735 theres a lot of ugly things in this world son i wish i could keep em all away from you thats never possible

6974750 some of these characters really got the raw deal when landed with their fictional mothers
6974751 it requires a great amount of self control and will power to avoid sex on certain days of the month especially if alcohol may be involved which most people do drink at some point in time
6974752 thankfully most of us are off the pep pills and sedatives nowadays
6974753 the pill allowed women to do what men had been doing sexual experimentation without having to get married
6974754 but if women hadnt been able to sexually experiment in the first place thanks to the pill would societies attitudes towards unwed mothers have changed
6974755 this is a competition of the world that only happens every four years
6974756 eavie you werent even alive last time this happened in some countries they kill the people if they dont win medals i think i heard once or that might have been the world cup but anyway lets watch watch watch
6974757 because you cant see if its a boy or a girl and thats rubbish
6974758 its a bit unfair for the people who are the best at it because it looks easy for them so you dont know how hard it really is
6974759 well tax the rich less and theyll spend more thereby stimulating the economy amp creating jobs for poor people
6974760 well fund our top sports people so they win lots of olympic medals thereby stimulating and inspiring the lard arses to get up and exercise too
6974761 it was a good entry but they were out of synch

6974768 man this chick is serious im gonna get my ass handed to me
6974769 so much to say about sisters and family dynamics the label thing for instance once youre defined as the baby or the smart pretty lazy one youre that to your family for the rest of your life and nothing can shake it you could be running a multi national empire and to your sisters youre still the slacker who probably still sleeps in till mid afternoon
6974770 would you like to come to a party at my house next week
6974771 so sorry we cant commit to a playdate right now life is a little hectic

6974774 wheres the knife i know its in my back somewhere
6974775 personally i would rather lie through my teeth with some kind of platitude that not even they believed so as not to make matters worse
6974776 mm how odd that a mother felt the need to video you covertly maybe she needed more information that she was getting from you verbally
6974777 of course when someone you know is seriously ill or bereaved the best thing to do is murmur platitudes tell them theyll be fine and scarper people should really should keep the details of these ordeals to themselves except to the extent that its funny after all laughters the best medicine isnt it no one wants to hear the sad stuff
6974778 he so quiet he needs to contribute more to classwork
6974779 i have absolutely no idea who your son is do you happen to have a photo
6974780 which stain remover do i need to use to deal with that disgusting teeshirt
6974781 not that youd know it as usually you send the nanny because youre too busy working clearly not one of us
6974782 im guessing hes your first lighten up girl before we all deck you
6974783 no actually i dont bother with that nor will you in six months time
6974784 ever since i moved out of the tenderloin ive been at a loss trying to get my hungover noodle craving fixed

6974788 i thought lotte took the comments with good grace and a degree of humour
6974789 my mum says i have to get off the internet now
6974790 ok heres a question which would you rather have your four year old witness going on between you a shagging or b a big row
6974791 when i was a child the idea of catching your parents
6974792 yes but shes shagging at the moment shell get back to you later dont worry though she doesnt smoke in front of me
6974793 oh baby it is all about the crab cones and the lychee mojitos lovely helpful staff and what a fabulous seafood menu
6974794 lets give banana blossom a try it gets great reviews on yelp
6974795 bay watch formerly first watch is one of my favorite breakfast places
6974796 you cant give me some kind of inhaler something to help me breathe
6974797 but the doctor who examined me yesterday said no such thing was available
6974798 bitch i work in the morning and i was already there on saturday
6974799 at what age did falling down start hurting so dang much
6974800 you havent been to x ray yet you should have gone awhile ago
6974801 wow your breathe feels like really hot or something like its practically burning my skin
6974802 they took my alcohol the government they took my alcohol
6974803 the only way we can achieve energy and climate security in this country is to reduce our dependence on oil we should take back tax breaks for big oil companies and invest in green energy technology we should have a windfall profits tax to fund everything from mass transit to high speed rail to the next generation of safe efficient cars finally we should restrict speculation and price gouging and stand up to opecs monopoly we need solutions of the future not drilling ourselves deeper into dependence on oil
6974804 this is reversible man this is reversible we dont have to go down this road i refuse to believe the majority of people believe this malarkey
6974805 unfortunately todays presidential hopefuls are largely full of hot air on the climate energy issue not one of them is proposing anything hard
6974806 i didnt want it you wanted it its your problem
6974807 i was recommended to go to this dentist from an ex boyfriend and he is amazing
6974808 to the outside world its a big fat market where you have people like paris hilton going to parties now she doesnt have anything to do with anything i think the festival is close to being out of control
6974809 i still wouldnt watch or read anything about her but thats not the point i think the polo set have had their true colours revealed
6974810 freak disgusting degrading screwed up arent these terribly strong words used for minor nudity
6974811 sit down get your breasts out and have a cup of tea luv
6974812 doesnt have to go to the lengths shes gone to to make money
6974813 shes a fruitcake and i dont find her attractive actually but i do love her even though she obviously doesnt give a damn about me
6974814 the entire polo scene is populated by tacky tarty girls whose access to money does not afford them any class
6974815 you cant succeed by taking your clothes off and not expect repercussions for having taken the low road to success or have we become so pc weve forgotten our morals
6974816 women now typically have only one or two children and they expect them and their births to be perfect
6974817 i can honestly say that i have never come across a midwife who would even acknowledge that for some women vaginal birth is akin to abuse and in these circumstances an elective caesarean is the most appropriate method of giving birth
6974818 please remember that the goals here are a healthy child and a healthy mother
6974819 dont be silly youre not in labour and youre coping very well
6974820 would rather that people like you couldnt breed in order that my ideal of childbirth could be maintained
6974821 listen to what theyre saying is it about me and the baby
6974822 but it all looked so pink and fluffy in the magazines
6974823 what do you want women to do die on the streets giving birth while youre having a hissy fit because someone rightly questions your ridiculous demand for an epidural the minute your contractions start
6974824 midwives are often very spiteful people dedicated to ensuring that babies are born with the maximum of suffering and indignity
6974825 perhaps it would be better if the nhs did not exist so the majority of women could give birth in private hospitals dedicated to providing them the consumers with a service for which they are prepared and able to pay
6974826 do you cry more now than you did before the birth
6974827 you can do it go for the burn give me more more
6974828 i am certain yang peiyi lin miaoke lei cixin are scratching their heads wondering why silly grown ups are complaining about a perfect show now thats something these girls need to be shielded from stupidity
6974829 the appropriateness of having lin miaoke performing whiling playing yang peiyis recording is of course debatable
6974830 until it was pointed out to them by the global media
6974831 i cant say enough about this place got to be one of my regular stops
6974832 a great place for breakfast food and sandwiches served in ample quantity with a basic standard diner ambience
6974833 well im not your waiter that guy over there is
6974834 just visited amp enjoyed the new pizza joint amp in all places west oakland near the main post office and west oakland bart
6974835 tiny place with open windows and a pizza oven when its warm outside
6974836 how nasty is thumbing down adoptive parents for listing their family and circumstances that brought them to adopt
6974837 the shame attached to unwed motherhood did serve a useful purpose once upon a time while we have happily retired the word bastard and the attendant emotional pain for mother and child acceptance of childbearing outside marriage represents not just a huge shift in attitudes but potentially a restructuring of the future human family by elevating single motherhood from an unfortunate consequence of poor planning to a sophisticated act of self fulfilment we have helped to fashion a world in which fathers are not just scarce but in which men are also superfluous
6974838 lots of women can do and always will raise children without fathers whether out of necessity tragedy or other circumstance but that fact cant logically be construed to mean that children dont need a father
6974839 attending lamaze classes counting contractions bottling expressed milk for nighttime feeds
6974840 boys need relationships with men to understand how to sustain relationships in the world the assistant professor of psychology at cornell university and a former gender scholar at stanford university said in a
6974841 but it does not have to be the one man in the mothers bedroom the boys she encountered actually had more male influence in their lives than boys from traditional families where the father was often the only man they knew on average the american man sees his children for 11 minutes a day
6974842 we need young men and women who will commit and marry and raise children in stable homes unprogressive though it sounds the world in which we live requires no less
6974843 i need to spend the rest of my life with you
6974844 i need to spend the rest of my life with you
6974845 well in your case you just havent reached the point yet where youre not prepared to keep going on
6974846 we cant let x work from home she wont do any work
6974847 already even in the office why havent you sacked her then
6974848 remember your children are your responsibility not the states and not your employers
6974849 have had one day off school in five years for m y mothers funeral
6974850 marry a non sexist man is the most important thing and always ensure your career is as important and ideally high earning as his
6974851 if a child only wants it smother when its ill then the child will have to lump it and learn the world does not revolve around it even if its god chicken pox
6974852 my child is sick im doing meeting by phone today
6974853 oh my god were going to have to iron his clothes when he goes to school
6974854 a healthy person is someone who hasnt had enough tests done
6974855 even parkers assertion that fathers are being written out of the picture is less than watertight who is saying that children dont need a father or at least a father figure experts and studies agree that children function best in a two parent household
6974856 in her book raising boys without men how maverick moms are creating the next generation of exceptional men peggy drexler found that while male role models were important for healthy boys
6974857 any fool with a dick can make a baby it takes a real man to raise his children
6974858 do you mean as opposed to stuffing them up the chimney for the afternoon
6974859 it depends on the person and on the age of their chidlren
6974860 if a woman decides to become pregnant or accidentally but thats her responsibility
6974861 she should either be prepared for her career to take a hit or arrange for someone else to care for her children whilst she goes back to work
6974862 the real question is do most women really want to go back to work rather than care for their children i think we all know the answer to that one
6974863 the money spent on recruitment and training of graduates the teaching of management skills to an ever changing population of people moving on it costs a bomb
6974864 now i am all in favour of young people getting work and experience and moving round the economy
6974865 its less than the cost of the non currently procreating majority doing their career management
6974866 the golden payback years can come when the children are school age
6974867 im guessing to be honest that ive seen a lot more companies than you have so maybe have a different picture of the potential
6974868 who is saying that children dont need a father or at least a father figure
6974869 all other things such as a person getting another job are equal but its the pregnancy issue that puts companies off the most
6974870 is it not every civilised persons responsibility to aim for equality for all and not promoting any one group
6974871 most women naturally have the skills it takes to be a secretary
6974872 part of the responsibility is to allow my daughter to have a relationship with her daddy
6974873 cant women even consider how it feels for a man who is dying for child to be told his child will be aborted regardless of what he thinks
6974874 most women naturally have the skills it takes to be a secretary
6974875 her point about abortion is a delicate one but cant women even consider how it feels for a man who is dying for a child to be told his child will be aborted regardless of what he thinks clearly women should hold the casting vote but i cant understand why women seem incapable of putting themselves in a mans shoes in that situation
6974876 why its just like you could read what was inside of me
6974877 oh look scarecrow its a man a man made out of tin yes
6974878 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6974879 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6974880 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6974881 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6974882 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6974883 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6974884 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6974885 if you are in cahoots with mccain and you scrw with my guy with an october surprise i will make you regret it for the rest of your life obama isnt zhvania obama matters

6974922 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
6974923 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
6974924 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
6974925 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
6974926 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
6974927 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
6974928 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
6974929 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
6974930 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
6974931 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples

6974936 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6974937 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems

6975106 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6975107 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6975108 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
6975109 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
6975110 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home
6975111 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
6975112 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
6975113 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
6975114 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
6975115 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
6975116 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game
6975117 si te da pereza pensar imagina lo que te costara vivir
6975118 but there is much that must be done both in and beyond the judicial system
6975119 a real worry is the knowledge that some victims will not come to the criminal courts to give evidence because of fear and equally they look askance at the family court because of the uneven standard of security we can and must do better

6975125 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6975126 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven
6975127 now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6975128 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6975129 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6975130 when im campaigning around the country now it doesnt matter if im in a coffee shop across the street from the statehouse in carson city or at an event with the washoe county democrats or down in tupelo mississippi everyone wants to know about iraq
6975131 people can come here and have personal contact with someone who might become the new leader of our nation
6975132 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6975133 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6975134 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6975135 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6975164 our biggest question going into the game was how was our defense
6975165 we had some young line backers in there we had some starters that were hurt and they were able to step in and we were pleased with that
6975166 we were able to do a little bit more early on this year i dont think we lost a beat
6975167 theres a whole world of music that you dont hear anymore and its on 78 rpm records

6975182 ich bin v llig berw ltigt der gl cklichste mensch der welt die siegerehrung war ein wechselbad der gef hle f r mich ich wusste nicht ob ich lachen oder weinen sollte ich glaube ich habe beides gemacht als die deutsche nationalhymne gespielt wurde bekam ich eine g nsehaut
6975183 ich wusste dass ich schnell laufen kann also war mir eine medaille so gut wie sicher aber f r gold musste ich verdammt hart arbeiten denn heather fell lie sich nicht absch tteln
6975184 ich hatte deshalb richtig bammel da waren ble st rze dabei
6975185 um ehrlich zu sein ich wei noch gar nicht so recht was ich machen soll das ganze interesse an mir die viele fragen das ist alles sch n aber f r eine f nfk mpferin eher ungew hnlich ich versuche so gut wie m glich damit umzugehen
6975186 ich hoffe dass der f nfkampf jetzt mehr in den mittelpunkt r ckt hier in peking vor 40 000 zuschauern zum abschluss zu laufen war fantastisch bei internationalen wettk mpfen in berlin kommen in der regel weniger zuschauer als beim training von hertha bsc das ist schon traurig
6975187 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
6975188 i really wanted to register voters and thats what ive done the most for the league
6975189 i think people should definitely have a voice and informed voting is one of the most important things we americans can do
6975190 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6975191 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6975192 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6975193 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6975194 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6975195 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6975196 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6975197 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6975198 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6975199 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6975200 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6975201 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6975202 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6975203 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6975204 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6975205 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6975206 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6975207 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6975208 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6975209 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6975210 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6975211 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6975212 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6975213 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6975214 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6975215 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6975216 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6975217 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6975218 who are open to doing something on the production side
6975219 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6975220 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6975221 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6975222 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6975223 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6975224 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6975225 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6975226 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6975227 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6975228 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6975229 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6975230 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6975231 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6975232 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6975233 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6975234 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6975235 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6975236 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6975237 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6975238 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6975239 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6975240 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6975241 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6975242 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6975243 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6975244 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6975245 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6975246 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6975247 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6975248 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6975249 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6975250 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6975251 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6975252 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6975253 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6975254 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6975255 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6975256 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6975257 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6975258 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6975259 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6975260 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6975261 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6975262 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6975263 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6975264 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6975265 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6975266 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6975267 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6975268 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6975269 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6975270 exactly what they said was that if the dalai lama comes to costa rica hu jintao wont come and thats not convenient for costa rica
6975271 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
6975272 the tragedy is that we no longer have a representative government in this country and in most countries the hope is that the little people will come to accept that
6975273 it is an honor to receive this award on behalf of our nations older adults
6975274 falls are the leading cause of injury death and the most common cause of trauma related hospital admission for older americans i am pleased the safety of seniors act is now a law because it will go a long way in protecting people from falls as they grow older
6975275 i congratulate john berrey on his appointment to the advisory council on historic preservation
6975276 john is a valued partner in working to bring relief to the residents who live near the tar creek superfund site and the environmental clean up of the site he is the first chairman of the quapaw tribe to successfully work to lift the moratorium on chat sales at tar creek this accomplishment allows the chat to be used as a resource and not simply as a waste as a result selling of chat is now a benefit to the tribe i know john will bring the same kind of innovation and dedication to his work on the council
6975277 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject
6975278 todays announcement is good news for the future of our aerial refueling fleet our air force and our armed forces as a whole

6975284 ive been spending all my time literally not figuratively focusing on how id govern i havent focused nearly as much as the other guys on how id win
6975285 the irony is i was probably a better tactical candidate 20 years ago than i am now
6975286 obama has the judgment he has the intellect which no one doubts and i guarantee you he has the steel in his spine to lead this country of ours out of the deep hole we have dug ourselves into
6975287 but id look at beau and hunter asleep and wonder what new terrors their own dreams held and wonder who would explain to my sons my being gone too
6975288 and i knew i had no choice but to fight to stay alive
6975289 the most prepared to be president of the united states
6975290 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than senator biden
6975291 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
6975292 one of the reasons were in trouble is the last eight to 12 years both political parties have concluded youve got to be able to get your whole platform down to a bumper sticker but things are much more complicated and serious than that im going to treat the american people with respect im going to give them my rationale im not going to assume they cant understand it
6975293 left wing democrats in congress like bernie sanders and dennis kucinich arent content with the liberal domination of network television higher and lower education major newspapers news magazines the arts and
6975294 what thats all about is that the american people want to bring our troops home

6975315 but we were very surprised this year when a profusion of wild flowers came up without us doing anything
6975316 i think it was because we disturbed the earth and all the dormant seeds came to life
6975317 a pair of wild ducks have already raised their first family at the pond

6975324 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6975325 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6975326 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6975327 i want somebody who is going to be able to

6975338 ill never know what the listeners feel from my music and thats too bad

6975352 in kosovo there was a un presence there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing there was a standstill in negotiations no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play
6975353 without the issue of kosovos independence i dont think that we would have seen this georgia story unfurl as quickly as it has
6975354 those opposed to recognizing kosovos independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence but that provoked the intervention of one state georgia which wanted to keep control of all its territory
6975355 the backdrop behind russias moves was the wests behavior in kosovo with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence despite moscows opposition
6975356 more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two rebel georgian regions which would allow them to intervene when they wish
6975357 russia cant expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions

6975372 i needed a place to live so i bought this live work space and started this art gallery
6975373 i have no experience running a gallery but i do collect art thats my experience with art
6975374 its going to be a great loss for all the artists in that area
6975375 theres just not enough venues for artists to show and sell their stuff through
6975376 people that i didnt know came to see my work they came specifically to see me and that helps
6975377 every time i visited the gregory kate gallery i was welcomed like a guest in a friends home chris and i had many heart to heart conversations and i felt very nurtured as an artist
6975378 i was sad to find out he was closing the gallery doors because the world needs more exhibit spaces with people like chris running them who believe in the importance of art in peoples lives
6975379 i live here and it would probably do me more harm than good

6975539 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
6975540 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
6975541 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
6975542 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am
6975543 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
6975544 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful

6975586 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
6975587 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen

6975589 each client owed on average approximately 48 000 00 with the highest single tax liability being nearly 480 000 00 most of the clients cases were successfully concluded within one year but it is important to remember that the amount of time it takes to negotiate a settlement with the irs depends on a variety of factors including how quickly the taxpayer can provide financial documents requested by the irs
6975590 i strongly encourage taxpayers struggling with irs back taxes to call my law firm
6975591 sometimes people do not realize that they have options the irs is willing to negotiate and even cease collections if you show them you cannot afford to fully repay your tax liability the lawyers at my law firm are skilled at negotiating with the irs and know how to get taxpayers the resolutions they deserve

6975617 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6975618 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners

6975829 developing national state and local obesity prevention policies present one of our greatest opportunities to prevent and reduce one of the primary causes of chronic disease
6975830 it is now clear that a future without significant investment in prevention will include devastating health and economic consequences
6975831 actions by state health departments and their partners are producing promising results in communities related to the two most important areas for obesity prevention increasing physical activity and healthy eating
6975832 but a lack of funding for health promotion and disease prevention is cited by state health department respondents as a major barrier to preventing and treating obesity in their states

6975844 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6975845 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6975846 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law

6975848 im happy for you i bet jeannies thrilled jennifers a great girl

6975853 jennifer knows me and on some level she didnt actually want me to be that person again you know me better than anyone and you wanted me back the way i am
6975854 jeannie thinks i should make you my medical proxy and power of attorney shes sending the paperwork in the next data burst from earth after she gets home
6975855 she she trusts you to make the hard decisions to ultimately do whats best for me and um so do i it doesnt have to mean anything youre my team leader it should be up to you to make those calls anyway
6975856 it does mean something though it means a hell of a lot actually
6975857 you should probably know that um youre already the executor of my will i would have let you know before but i sort of hoped that youd never have to find out
6975858 well you dodged the bullet this time we both did
6975859 you i think in a way that by telling jennifer i was trying the words on for size it wasnt you know intentional i um im actually kind of hoping she gives me a pass considering that i was non compos mentis
6975860 no im not im fully compos mentis now and i i just ill go
6975861 every time something like this happens and i think im gonna lose you i swear to myself that if the universe would just cut me a little slack and let you off the hook ill stop kidding myself you know and then youre fine and everything goes back to normal and its easy to pretend that i could live without you
6975862 i forget sometimes that you dont actually know so im telling you now

6975876 we want to know the structure and composition of the soil at the surface at the ice and in between to help answer questions about the movement of water either as vapour or liquid between the icy layer and the surface
6975877 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6975878 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules

6975880 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6975881 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6975882 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6975883 it was too slow i never really made any money
6975884 i underestimated the amount of time it would take for it to become solvent
6975885 i kept having this dream where i was in an art gallery writing and i thought what the hey
6975886 i needed a place to live so i bought this live work space and started this art gallery
6975887 i have no experience running a gallery but i do collect art thats my experience with art
6975888 its going to be a great loss for all the artists in that area
6975889 theres just not enough venues for artists to show and sell their stuff through

6975920 this work represents a key step forward in producing a device to focus helium atoms
6975921 the remaining step is to combine the high reflectivity with a carefully deformed surface in order to create a focused atomic spot that is still quite a challenge
6975922 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway

6975938 although the indians can fill the dam between june 21 and aug 31 they can only do so by releasing at least 55 000 cusecs downstream we made a call to the indian indus basin water treaty commissioner who promised to get back after checking the facts from irrigation authorities in occupied kashmir

6975970 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6975971 it has been a long battle to assert the right of all new zealanders to be heard on this controversial issue
6975972 quite frankly in a democracy it should not require so much effort the referendum should be held at this years election
6975973 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try to avoid this being an election issue
6975974 they put an enormous amount of effort time and money into it so it is not a surprise
6975975 we will continue to engage in the debate it is all part of the process of changing the culture of violence in this country
6975976 the fact that these people are so determined to change the law back again just gives us more of an opportunity to educate people as to why we shouldnt be able to legally hit our children

6975989 there really wasnt a person to teach him and i told him what the best guys do
6975990 he read about it and started to do things and the rest of the team followed suit
6975991 at this point he is over the injury bug and its just a matter of keeping him healthy
6975992 if we did push him when he isnt as fit he might overrun and cause another injury wed rather be a bit more conservative and let him steadily regain his fitness
6975993 i always watch my diet because you can get out of shape pretty fast
6975994 i dont have to watch it much now that im running but i dont eat much junk food
6975995 it is a time commitment but also a lifestyle commitment

6976003 representations and concealments are deceptive misleading and made with the intent to induce elderly citizens to become residents at extendicares facilities under a false pretense namely that extendicare will provide nursing care consistent with their representations

6976017 she was murdered and you are responsible from the evidence its clear that sarah lunde did not have an easy life but it was her life and you chose to end that life and for that you deserve the maximum punishment
6976018 can you tell me the reason why maybe this happened
6976019 because of the volume of the circumstantial evidence we went that way
6976020 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6976021 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces

6976023 were committed to weaving the best security possible through the testing programs we provide to customers
6976024 we chose palmsecure because it is extremely accurate easy to use scalable and perceived more positively by test takers who often associate other biometric technologies such as fingerprinting with the police and criminal activity

6976026 being an international school exam security is something that we are always concerned about and watching for
6976027 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6976028 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6976029 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6976030 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
6976031 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
6976032 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6976033 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6976034 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6976035 ive been spending all my time literally not figuratively focusing on how id govern i havent focused nearly as much as the other guys on how id win
6976036 the irony is i was probably a better tactical candidate 20 years ago than i am now
6976037 obama has the judgment he has the intellect which no one doubts and i guarantee you he has the steel in his spine to lead this country of ours out of the deep hole we have dug ourselves into
6976038 but id look at beau and hunter asleep and wonder what new terrors their own dreams held and wonder who would explain to my sons my being gone too
6976039 and i knew i had no choice but to fight to stay alive
6976040 the most prepared to be president of the united states
6976041 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than senator biden
6976042 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
6976043 one of the reasons were in trouble is the last eight to 12 years both political parties have concluded youve got to be able to get your whole platform down to a bumper sticker but things are much more complicated and serious than that im going to treat the american people with respect im going to give them my rationale im not going to assume they cant understand it
6976044 im reevaluating whether us airways is the program for me
6976045 i want to emphasize that i do appreciate there are thousands of employees and that they need to make a living
6976046 but the sense that im getting is that us airways is not in tune with a lot of their frequent fliers and perhaps management could be a little more responsive
6976047 we suggest that vermont state senator lyons wake up from her deep sleep or self imposed stupor and look out over the global horizon to see a brave new world of international trade
6976048 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
6976049 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them
6976050 we hope the rebels are reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
6976051 while there has been resistance the groups there have been running around because wherever they withdraw they bump into some of our battalions
6976052 can set off a chain of reprisals and only increase the danger facing civilians
6976053 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6976054 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6976055 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6976056 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6976057 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6976058 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6976059 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6976060 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family
6976061 the war against terrorism is our own war and it will continue until its logical end

6976075 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6976076 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6976077 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6976078 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6976079 the official who spoke did so on condition of anonymity
6976080 officials said the obama campaign had taken the trouble to print material bearing the names of several potential ticketmates thereby minimizing the significance of a report that a printing company in kansas was churning out signs bearing bayhs name
6976081 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
6976082 i dont really know how anyone is keeping money from the dvd just churning cash
6976083 they opened the floodgates to competition which is fine but the demand didnt increase so when you throw in a bunch of sellers all of a sudden you find your ceiling
6976084 amazons more expensive for product listings but theyre reaching a wider audience
6976085 we believe further listing fee reductions are likely over the next few years as the company is pressured by amazon coms third party business and free google product search listings
6976086 price point is high on the product and on the player and ebays a discount marketplace
6976087 on amazon they want selection and service on ebay they want everything but theyll give up service to get the lowest price

6976094 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
6976095 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
6976096 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
6976097 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
6976098 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
6976099 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
6976100 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen obama directly hawaii law limits access to vital records to family members only a fact which slowed down the ability of researchers to compare the purported obama birth certificate which displayed from the start a peculiar provenance and inexplicable features to genuine specimens therefore it would seem that either maya k soetoro ng as she is now called supplied the document or its image to half brother barack or his campaign or obama his campaign used it without her permission
6976101 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
6976102 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
6976103 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
6976104 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
6976105 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
6976106 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president
6976107 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6976108 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6976109 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6976110 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6976111 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6976117 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france

6976121 long rumored as a candidate for national office biden launched a presidential bid in 1987 that was gaining traction until a video was leaked to the press that showed striking similarities between a speech by biden and an address by british labour party politician neil kinnock biden sought to beat back the controversy but subsequent allegations about plagiarism and resume inflation in law school forced him from the contest

6976219 life is like a box of legos before you even start you have to dump them all out and make a big mess of things but after you make that mess you can see where all the pieces are at lying in that lego pile you made
6976220 slowly but surely you will find the right pieces as your sort through that big mess and start building something whatever it is that your mind could possibly dream
6976221 after some time building picking and choosing from dozens of different legos with different functions you start to see those pieces creating a whole you start to see your very own creation coming to life
6976222 finally right after you place that very last piece and see your creation come to life you can look at the mess you made without much worry
6976223 all you needed was a little bit of determination the right pieces and some time to build your idea into reality

6976247 in werkelijkheid wil caers die spelers volledig onder zijn hoede nemen en weghalen van de club uiteraard kunnen wij dat niet toestaan caers kent onze jongeren perfect wij vinden het niet kunnen dat we op die manier onze talenten waar we alles voor doen verliezen en binnen een paar jaar wellicht aangesloten zien bij lierse

6976256 we hebben de laatste dagen zo slecht geslapen maar die zilveren op de 4 x 100 meter maakt alles goed
6976257 ik durfde niet kijken mijn hart kon zoveel spanning gewoon niet aan pas toen ik hoorde dat kim de stok zonder problemen in haar handen had gekregen ben ik naar de televisie gestormd wat ik toen zag was fantastisch ik kan het nog steeds niet geloven
6976258 ik had honderd procent gehoopt dat dat zou lukken maar natuurlijk verwacht je zoiets niet zeker niet na wat er in de halve finale van de 100 meter was gebeurd we hebben de laatste dagen zo slecht geslapen maar dit maakt alles goed
6976259 belgi heeft lang op die medaille moeten wachten maar eindelijk is het gelukt dat ons land zoveel geduld moest oefenen bewijst dat een medaille op de olympische spelen behalen niet eenvoudig is daarom vind ik het dubbel zo leuk dat het mijn dochter en haar vriendinnen gelukt is een mooier afscheid van de atletieksport bestaat niet

6976296 yeah when the channel decided on jade they asked me if it was okay with me if i had any ill feelings towards her id have said no to jade but the truth is there was no ill feelings towards jade my only precondition was that jade should be treated well at big boss i knew how it felt when to go into a foreign country and be in a hostile situation big brother to my delight the big boss contestants were very nice to jade i felt so proud to see how she was treated it just reiterated the fact we indians are very forgiving and welcoming

6976307 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6976308 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6976309 people are realizing that the job of police officers is to investigate crimes not protect us
6976310 it doesnt surprise me that individuals want to assure that they have the right to carry a weapon concealed for their safety
6976311 its drawing peoples attention to the issue we will probably continue to see a rise
6976312 the overall interest in self defense continues to rise in the country there are plenty of news stories about murders and rapes across the country
6976313 the odds of them being there at the time that you need them is probably zero
6976314 perhaps had there been a gun there legally it may not have been as tragic as it was
6976315 we have seen things happen like this during previous election years when there is a candidate that has an abysmal record on the second amendment
6976316 what people are seeing is a systematic smear effort by the nra which is basically an arm of the republican party
6976317 its a scare tactic and a smear that is just as false and just as absurd as the e mails going around suggesting barack is not christian
6976318 senator obama has affirmed over and over again exactly what the constitution says that the second amendment protects the right to bear arms
6976319 its disconcerting because more guns typically mean more crime especially in the streets of virginia
6976320 the gun was just lying around and he picked it up and eventually used it

6976324 it wasnt there when i took the camera away from my eye but it was there when i took the photo
6976325 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is
6976326 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
6976327 callers saw him at around 9 30pm on thursday and said he had been falling down and staggering about
6976328 when police arrived they found him in the garden of number six several doors away from his own home
6976329 there has been a dearth of evidence presented by the defendant concerning current deficits in adaptive functioning
6976330 mr intellectual functioning must be compared to the society or population where his conduct and behavior occurred
6976331 denounced obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that obama is not ready to be president
6976332 if i asked for a show of hands on impeachment i know what id get
6976333 and if i asked you about the war in iraq
6976334 thered be 250 hands in the air saying the troops should have been brought home last year
6976335 but many of you are old hands in politics youve been in the trenches for years
6976336 you know that weve got a big ship there in washington the titanic with a lot of right wing momentum pushing it forward it isnt easy to stop that ship and turn it
6976337 but if you can stop that ship if you can start to turn it
6976338 you can get the momentum going in your direction and really get something done with healthcare with jobs with ending the war with all the things democrats care about and thats what were doing with this election
6976339 now barack has taken some positions lately that i dont support myself
6976340 but we need to put that aside and get behind him in this very special year
6976341 we wont have this opportunity in four years or eight years i didnt think wed elect a person of color president for another 20 years at least
6976342 you know its going to be a tough race the republicans are good at dirty campaigning theyre going to remind you that obama is black theyre going to tell you about the years he spent living outside the u s when he was young
6976343 theyre going to tell you hes not a real american not one of
6976344 the last time i felt this kind of excitement with a candidate was in 1968 with bobby kennedy that ended here in the ambassador hotel on june 5th 1968

6976346 go down to a nice waterhole throw down the swag have a quiet drink chat
6976347 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy they need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits

6976349 these women want my blood they want to kill me
6976350 i just got punched out while waiting for a cab
6976351 half of my patients with alcohol related liver failure are under the age of 40
6976352 it is absolutely monstrous that this is happening that people should get to this stage at this time in their lives
6976353 research carried out by the world health organisation shows that brief interventions with patients does work by making them aware of the consequences of their drinking
6976354 this is something for all of us it is not a them and us issue this is about us as a society
6976355 it is also good that they are funding a specific post there is a need for someone to give leadership on this very important issue
6976356 we are not going to see any changes until the culture of excessive drinking in the north east is reversed
6976357 then people will not think it is cool to drink heavily
6976358 we wont be able to speculate on anything until we get the cause of death

6976360 were not going to stand for these kinds of threats in colorado
6976361 there has been a lot of fluctuation in the price but what has to be seen are the trends
6976362 in opec we have to evaluate if this is becoming a downward trend in order to make a decision about production that is our proposal but we have to consider it there in opec
6976363 nobody is thinking about adding new production to the market
6976364 i feel as if i am walking with destiny and that all my past life has been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial
6976365 as we grow we will eliminate inefficiencies logically it is a better idea for us to move to hyderabad from where we can handle our back office and technology functions more cost effectively
6976366 i have heard that vijender told the media that i am his favourite actress
6976367 well let me tell him that if he wins the gold medal for india i will go on a hot date with him
6976368 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
6976369 so hostile to ordinary american families that it could only have come about in a place as corrupt cynical and unmoored from reality as washington d c
6976370 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
6976371 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses

6976380 con 36 goles en contra es imposible pasar a una final de unos juegos as no ganamos a croacia
6976381 no sabemos poner freno para bien y para mal o nos salimos o no damos ni una

6976408 el primer d a a todo el mundo le cuesta encontrar los puntos de frenada adem s hay un par de curvas muy cerradas que vienen despu s de rectas largas y que requieren pisar fuerte el pedal del freno
6976409 es una zona de curvas r pidas donde notas mucho las fuerzas g y en las que te mueves mucho dentro del cockpit habit culo cuando conduces por este circuito tienes unas sensaciones nicas
6976410 es muy distinto a los otros circuitos urbanos que conocemos tiene zonas muy r pidas y hay mucho espacio en este sentido es parecido a los circuitos norteamericanos antiguos
6976411 he podido hablar con varios pilotos y todos est n muy contentos con la pista
6976412 todos esper bamos que hubiera problemas de juventud y por el momento no ha habido ninguno
6976413 antes de las curvas 2 12 y 17 aunque hay que salir muy tarde del rebufo

6976420 vamos a ver si les pitan los pasos y las faltas que hacen
6976421 a ver si entonces son capaces de ganar arrasando tanto y no me refiero a nuestro partido sino al de argentina
6976422 y si los chicos de mike krzyzewski son los rivales
6976423 por pedir que no quede a veces esos pasos que hacen en medio campo no tienen importancia pero en otras ocasiones toman una carrera que con su velocidad y su fuerza es imposible parar eso hay que mirarlo los lituanos se han defendido muy duro pero les han pitado las faltas aqu hay que hacer lo mismo al que dice que no hay que hacer simulaciones le digo yo ponte delante de lebron james cuando viene corriendo contra ti y no simules aguanta y no te caigas al suelo que eso es una simulaci n el nivelazo de estados unidos es mucho m s f cil de demostrar cuando ocurren las cosas que he comentado

6976429 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice
6976430 i thought that the way he ran a year ago was extremely impressive i thought maybe he should have gotten some consideration even last year
6976431 its an honor and a blessing to even be mentioned in the same sentence with the heisman trophy
6976432 for guys like archie to say something like that thats incredible
6976433 tim tebow is the type of guy who works hard im sure hes working his butt off to get a second one
6976434 you know what you can always say youre the first to win two
6976435 if tim tebow has the kind of season thats deserving of another heisman then let him have it hes an outstanding young man and hes done some tremendous things on the football field and in the community
6976436 but thats what it boils down to the best man wins

6976445 to support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
6976446 to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol
6976447 in regards to the age debate jmu will look to the lawmakers to decide on what the proper age should be
6976448 im not convinced that lowering the drinking age to 18 will resolve the big challenge that many young adults face
6976449 id be particularly concerned about what would likely result in more traffic fatalities
6976450 its very unlikely anybodys going to be rolling the drinking age back anytime soon
6976451 by lowering the age it would probably encourage more drinking not less

6976707 thats nice i wish i could afford to live here
6976708 great lakes classic at ford field where anything less than a solid performance could set off a panic that lasts the rest of the preseason
6976709 were gonna try to do better than monday night and i think we will said browns coach romeo crennel whose team is 0 2 in exhibition play
6976710 the guys are focused and theyre back down to earth after what happened
6976711 i want to see smart football i dont want to see the mistakes i saw on monday night
6976712 were a down to earth hard working team he said
6976713 we know weve got a lot of tough things ahead of us were going to try to take anything one day at a time if anything that was good for us to not look too far ahead because new york was a tough team now weve got detroit
6976714 i think we got a heck of a football player with him barry said
6976715 hes come right in hes fit right in and gosh dang i think it was awesome that he was here all offseason brian kelly and travis fisher are our starters but ive considered leigh a starter since weve gotten him
6976716 it was a load off my shoulders to get traded and get a new deal he said
6976717 i just want to play football and thats what i can do here
6976718 its going well for me but its just new im still trying to figure out the ins and outs of the system figuring out where your help is and when it will be there but im happy and im looking forward to going against the browns in a different setting
6976719 as a first group i thought we played excellent in the first game against the jets and if you say boy were going to win the super bowl because of that youre wrong tackle joe thomas said
6976720 we executed very poorly in the game against the giants and if you say were going to lose every game watch out i think youd be wrong as well
6976721 no one on this team is going to get too high or too low about what happens in the preseason
6976722 when he got up thursday it was bothering him again
6976723 he had to get another shot in it once he got the shot we couldnt play him in the game
6976724 thats the best theyve looked in preseason this was a big opportunity for chris and he did a good job
6976725 the heat that were getting is that were not getting enough pass rush
6976726 its kind of frustrating because we get all these quarterback hits and pressures but it doesnt really matter unless we get a sack
6976727 but its still preseason im not going to panic its something we do have to fix but we have coaches who watch film and we have no choice but to fix it
6976728 i wish i could have gotten a catch but other than that i felt fine and was happy to be back with my teammates
6976729 hes one of the best backs in the league im not going to take anything away from him but i think it was more the scheme
6976730 i know on one play i was up field trying to get the quarterback and it was a draw so i made the gap wide
6976731 but i think we just have to be more disciplined about the run
6976732 when he entered the room his eyes met a gaze and the rest was history

6976755 he took a big step forward tonight with a couple big hits against left handers
6976756 one of the better games weve played in the past three or four weeks
6976757 weve been struggling everybody knows it but were pulling together
6976758 for decades the government has been giving land and creating facilities for religious purposes for all communities
6976759 when crores of rupees were given for the kumbh mela in allahabad did you hear a single protest from muslims when the state made arrangements for bakri id and the prophets birthday did any hindu object or when land was given to house haj committee offices the secular law that applies to the country must cover kashmir as well
6976760 kashmiri muslims with their distorted perspectives dont realise that disrespect towards a religion is un islamic
6976761 why should we stick our neck out for kashmiri muslims
6976762 they brand us hindustani muslims they never sympathise with our problems issues like ayodhya didnt move them we cannot buy land in the valley they dont have social relations with us
6976763 there are violations on both sides of civilians and security forces its a battle between the people of the valley and the centre in which we cant be expected to take sides
6976764 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6976765 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6976766 thats kind of a weird feeling about the situation here in chicago
6976767 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox
6976768 in my opinion each one of them would want to be there and will be there that president will want to demonstrate to the world that the u s represented by chicago wants to welcome the world back to the united states
6976769 of course he will be there and we can enjoy his support
6976770 i am sick and tired of our name being dragged through the mud like this
6976771 yesterday my ioc colleagues were continually making reference to what they called another scandal for ireland
6976772 i was asked before coming to beijing what my wish for these games was and i answered that it would be ireland going through the three weeks without being tainted by any hint of doping
6976773 we have to get answers the irish sports council is responsible for the testing of athletes and they do a very good job of it procedures are followed rigorously we want the same standards to apply to equestrian sports and right now that doesnt seem the case
6976774 that to me must be serious worry to the whole horse industry in ireland because it seems to be constantly under the microscope these days

6976804 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is

6976809 mai please the office does not need to hear this just keep it low
6976810 you heard me it took you a month to get ayumi to get rika her credit cards and cash i dont believe you
6976811 whats the big deal she did get the cards and some cash
6976812 10 000 pesos you know you can do better than that and we have an idea of what you did with her last night
6976813 now dont try escaping this one with your eh if i remember correctly you made me get miki a shopping spree after your first ehem with her
6976814 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6976815 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night
6976816 i dont believe you i know you yoshiko she smelled like your room
6976817 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6976818 what mai wait a second i thought i was hearing things
6976819 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6976820 when you called me shi chan last night i knew something was up
6976821 you only call me that when youre thinking of something important
6976822 so when you asked me about suggestions on what to cook for breakfast i was a bit suspicious if thats what you really called me for
6976823 ayumi paused she didnt know how to complete the sentence actually she didnt even know what she wanted to drive at with this conversation
6976824 rika chan did you and yocchan did you two have sex
6976825 how come ayaka and mai said you smelled like her room
6976826 do i im not sure if i really do smell like her room but if thats really the case thats because i do sleep in her room now
6976827 we didnt have sex we just sleep in the same bed thats all
6976828 wait a minute you sleep in the same room and in the same bed and you havent had sex
6976829 i cant believe you were able to resist the legendary yoshizawa hitomi
6976830 i asked her if we could do it and she said no
6976831 i dont believe you youre not the type and shes not the type that just cant be youre kidding around again rika i thought this was a ladies conversation
6976832 i cant believe you were able to resist the legendary yoshizawa hitomi
6976833 i asked her if we could do it and she said no
6976834 hello oh ayaya hmm cant we have a video conference in an hour im in the middle of something important here what do you mean rikas in trouble what uso
6976835 oh yeah jo this is ayumi shibata shes my best friend shi chan this is jo a friend
6976836 jo if you may just speak in english while were here shes japanese too
6976837 were friends way back shes been my bestfriend since forever it just so happens that shes working for yocchan now
6976838 yeah who knew that my yocchan and shi chan would be working together i think its fate
6976839 we had warned the government to target police and the army if it didnt stop operations against us in swat
6976840 ive only been here two games and things havent been good
6976841 i dont think you put too much stock on results but weve still got to regroup
6976842 my confidence comes from how the team feels and i think the team is really on a high right now
6976843 last week was kind of mixed emotions because of the conditions and the weather
6976844 we had several key mistakes so we were able to learn from that
6976845 i didnt pitch my greatest it was six innings of survival it was like boy scouts just making do with what i had
6976846 im looking forward to facing somebody other than joe inglett leading off the game
6976847 ill be excited that maybe lyle overbay wont be in the lineup and recognizes everything that comes out of my hand
6976848 i knew he was a good catcher but hes a great receiver
6976849 hes really good he blocks the ball better than i thought he did what he brings behind the plate a wealth of knowledge against the hitters is great ive enjoyed throwing to him i think weve gelled pretty quickly
6976850 the first day there was a little bit of uncertainty early because i wasnt sure how hitters react to him you use those first three of four innings to get a bit of a read today there was much more rhythm
6976851 i think aaron rodgers has done everything right from a focus standpoint
6976852 he was put in a situation thats different hes done a very good job of focusing through that and at the end of the day you need to focus on playing quarterback and i thought he did that very well tonight
6976853 it has been a good preseason so far a lot of growing as a player and i think tonight was a good step for our offense after last week and to get the kind of time i got tonight we really needed to take a step forward and i think we did that
6976854 im happy for him hes in a tough spot over there he needed this outing
6976855 he looked sharp their offense looked good so i think theyre going to be pretty good
6976856 we audibled to just a go route because it was press and there was no safety over the top and there was a young guy in front of me
6976857 i kept us in the game we were never out of it
6976858 we got the at bats we needed in the end
6976859 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good
6976860 if you can hold them to one run an inning its not as demoralizing to your team we were able to stay in and come back and win it
6976861 i was trying to be too perfect with it and i was far from it on that one
6976862 i think weve done our homework on him and faced him enough so that we have a pretty good idea how he pitches
6976863 what you have to do is make him throw it over the plate you cant chase it
6976864 the ones cabrera threw at the end might have had double hit me on them
6976865 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine

6976873 i had never played over there in the minor leagues or big leagues i was just trying to find a way to get into a comfort zone so i could let my instincts take over
6976874 my mentality as a baseball player is whatever you ask me ill do it
6976875 thats the type of player i feel like i need to be
6976876 i dont think were looking to get him way stretched out
6976877 we just want to bring him along be very conservative about it and hopefully see him get some starts in september
6976878 physically he felt better and the ball came out of his hand well
6976879 hes taken some steps forward and on occasion he has taken a step back but he took a big step forward tonight
6976880 we had some timely hitting and just glad we came out with the win
6976881 five good innings we made the decision to get him out and it cost us some runs and made for a hairy situation
6976882 he didnt get the win but he did pitch well
6976883 were trying to get him going and hes having to do it with all these left handers
6976884 lets just hope they do turn out to be three high level teams
6976885 ive seen guys coach five teams before but not as well as josh
6976886 im having a great time it really is rewarding to see the development of so many players

6976930 ia heran bagaimana mungkin orang sekaliber hussein hidup di wilayah terpencil
6976931 sebagai rakyat banten dan pemuda yang telah siap merdeka kami bersumpah mewujudkan proklamasi itu
6976932 saya sanggup menandatanganinya asal seluruh rakyat dan bangsa indonesia menyetujui dan mendukung saya
6976933 ia malah membiarkannya pergi jalan kaki lepas dari pandangan mata
6976934 rupanya sejarah proklamasi 17 agustus tidak mengizinkan saya campur tangan hanya mengizinkan campur jiwa saja ini sangat saya sesalkan tetapi sejarah tidak mempedulikan penjelasan seorang manusia atau segolongan manusia
6976935 alang alang tak akan musnah kalau tidak dicabut dengan akar akarnya
6976936 bagaimana mungkin orang yang tampak seperti petani ini bisa menganalisis segala galanya dengan begitu tajam

6976943 i dont think its possible to play yourself i dont really know who i am as a character and really dont want to
6976944 was that she was proud of being a nurse but yet you could sense that she really wanted to get back up there and be an actress
6976945 while she was a nurse she was going to be sure she looked great and had on just the right outfit and made sure it was tight enough and short enough so people would still appreciate that she was a sexy nurse i just liked that sort of insecurity and need for attention
6976946 maybe after being around for so long going sort of up and down ive been so used to that that i have a great sense of humor finally about the absurdity of this business were in ive been able to laugh and realize that where i am right now even though its slightly more obscure has worked for my life in such an amazing way
6976947 probably five years before i was much more in fear like every actor that its all going to end and what would i do what if i cant work with the best people now i just really enjoy the work that i do every year i seem to find one movie and even if it doesnt see the light of day it still challenges me as an actress i still work with people i really respect im actually happier now than ive ever been
6976948 i think they offered it to a lot of different actresses before and i heard through the grapevine that some of them were possibly offended when they got the offer
6976949 he director andrew fleming said he wanted to possibly change the script so they would know who i was out of respect which i think is so so sweet but i told him immediately that i thought they should not know who i am thats part of the joke and that happens all the time
6976950 mostly people think they recognize you from somewhere did they go to school with you and then you feel really embarrassed saying well no im an actress but its always nice
6976951 sometimes things can be so bad that they become good in some ways i really do believe that if you put hamlet 2 on broadway and committed to the absurdity of it it would turn into something ironic and funny and much better than you think
6976952 id like to play george clooneys part in the musical of michael clayton
6976953 i would love it if people recognized me the way he recognized me in the movie gosh i dont think ive ever experienced quite the hysteria that he provides
6976954 he felt like he met julia roberts and meryl streep in one person they would probably love it we all think we have to be really quiet around them not talk to them or look at them but in fact maybe they would love to feel that kind of appreciation
6976955 growing up in suburban new jersey i really didnt have any way to interact with any famous people where i would feel that way
6976956 i think rock stars still make me get all weird im a jersey girl so i got to meet bruce springsteen once and i was very flustered
6976957 my only problem doing a part thats self mocking would be that sometimes its a double bluff if you see actors playing themselves it can be like hey get a load of me im so cool that i can laugh at myself you have to be careful how you do it
6976958 always had a kind of healthy disregard for the machine that she was part of not in a cynical way but not buying into the bull if i took myself too seriously she would totally totally bring me down to earth
6976959 i love to give him s that i had no idea who he was but i looked him up on the internet and thought he was really cute and thought oh ok
6976960 i did know that he was a great actor and a brilliant comedian but i didnt know of his work i did remember him from night at the museum just because my kids had watched it over and over again

6976982 thats not exactly the guy hamilton you want to face as the tying run
6976983 we threw him all fastballs changing them up between two and four seamers we wanted to keep his eye moving we didnt want him to extend his hands on the 3 2 pitch if i was going to miss i would miss in we didnt want to give him a chance to hit it out of the park
6976984 it was big for us to tack on runs there
6976985 in this park a one run lead is not enough its never over until the last out is made
6976986 what happened was he got ahead of cabrera with two strikes then cabrera made him throw a ton of pitches
6976987 they did a good job of working him fouling off pitches i just thought they hit some good pitches hes only human

6976994 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6976995 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president

6977030 i was wondering if you have accepted jesus christ as your lord and savior
6977031 my reticence about public displays of religious faith flows both from the style of my familys religious observances and from a belief that gods will is expressed by men through their actions toward and on behalf of others
6977032 it would have been out of character even demagogic for me to inject my personal religious faith into my speeches
6977033 the basic teachings of religion especially those that have to do with peoples relationships with one another can easily be translated into secular terms you dont have to believe in god to honor your parents or to be honest in your business dealings or to treat others as you would have them treat you

6977039 my lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me and if they are driven hard one day all the flocks will die

6977041 please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me

6977114 iran desperately needs foreign investment in their petroleum sector which accounts for 80 percent of the countrys hard currency and over 50 percent of the governments annual budget by targeting this sector divestment will directly impact the most critical sector of irans economy
6977115 to begin the process of divesting investments that do direct business with iran
6977116 as an epicenter for terrorist activity having provided a safe haven training and equipment to al qaeda
6977117 the goal of the investment portfolio and the policy guiding the decisions affecting the portfolio must be to maximize investment return
6977118 endangers the systems tax exempt status and potentially breaches the boards fiduciary duties as trustees
6977119 this is just another example of issues in working with trs management and the trs board chair
6977120 that some companies will attempt to rhetorically obfuscate their involvement with iran so as to avoid any consequences
6977121 it does not appear from these responses that any of the responding companies which included alstom wartsila oyl petrochina and bhel provided information or displayed a willingness to embark on substantial action in a way that would warrant their removal from the texas trs scrutinized companies list
6977122 let me tell you first that i appreciate the opportunity you are giving our company
6977123 to explain the involvement we have in the islamic republic of iran for the time being
6977124 our position is strengthened by the fact that the united nations security council in its resolutions aimed at suspending irans nuclear enrichment program established a clear distinction between potentially proliferating forbidden activities and customary authorized industrial activities like those we are conducting
6977125 iran is a major resource holder it has the second largest natural oil and gas resources at current global gas usage irans gas is enough to supply the entire world for about ten years given the size and global importance of iranian hydrocarbon resources the group finds it hard to see a future in which production of these resources would not at some point play a role in the global energy supply and demand balance
6977126 utimco invests solely in the interests of its beneficiaries specifically the boards investment policies prohibit utimco from investing the boards funds so as to achieve temporal benefits for any purpose including use of its economic power to advance social or political purposes
6977127 the list of social or political causes that have lobbied for investment restrictions in just the recent few years includes but is not limited to alcohol tobacco gambling pornography nuclear proliferation environmental and other issues
6977128 finally while it appears likely that investment restrictions will have cost implications for the investments funds it is less likely that such restrictions would have any meaningful long term effect upon the targeted companies
6977129 theyre not punishing iran and phillip morris or whoever theyre punishing the teachers of texas
6977130 perhaps most importantly while utimco does not engage in social investing we do understand that social or political considerations may very well have a bearing on the ultimate value of certain investments

6977274 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6977278 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6977279 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6977280 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6977285 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6977286 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6977287 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6977288 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6977289 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6977290 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6977291 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6977292 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6977296 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6977297 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6977298 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6977299 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6977300 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6977303 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6977304 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6977305 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6977306 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6977307 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6977308 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6977309 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6977310 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6977311 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6977312 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6977313 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6977314 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6977315 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6977316 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6977317 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6977318 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6977319 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6977320 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6977321 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6977322 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6977323 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6977324 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6977325 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6977326 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6977327 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6977328 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6977329 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6977330 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6977331 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6977332 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6977333 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6977334 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6977335 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6977336 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6977337 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6977338 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6977339 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6977340 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6977341 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6977342 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6977343 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6977344 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6977345 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6977346 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6977347 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6977348 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6977349 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6977373 globally there is adequate fresh water available and that looks set to continue in the long term figures from the fao indicate that we currently extract less than 10 per cent of the 43 750 cubic kilometers of fresh water returned each year to the earths rivers lakes and aquifers the water is not distributed evenly of course within a given country water consumption can vary from less than 1 percent of available resources to more than 100 percent meaning that in some cases resources are being overexploited and degraded
6977374 nations can thrive on surprisingly meager quantities of fresh water provided they adopt water efficient technologies and encourage economic activity that doesnt guzzle water

6977392 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6977393 i walked round the corner here and just up there in that tree was a monkey staring down at us
6977394 we sort of shook the peanuts at her and she came down and eventually just got onto my shoulder and down to the crate put the peanuts in and she was happy to get them
6977395 unbelievable you know we were just so thrilled to have her back
6977396 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6977397 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6977398 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6977399 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6977400 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6977401 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6977402 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6977403 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6977404 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

6977408 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6977409 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6977410 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6977411 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6977417 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6977418 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6977419 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6977420 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6977421 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6977422 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6977423 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6977424 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6977425 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6977426 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6977427 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6977428 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6977429 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6977430 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6977431 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6977432 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6977433 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6977434 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6977435 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6977436 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6977437 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6977438 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6977439 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6977440 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6977441 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6977442 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6977443 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6977444 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6977445 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6977446 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6977447 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6977448 they reflect our past emanate our present and suggest our future
6977449 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6977450 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6977451 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6977452 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6977453 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6977454 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6977455 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6977456 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6977457 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6977458 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6977459 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6977460 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6977461 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6977462 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6977463 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6977464 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6977465 we already have the world class infrastructure logistics financial and communication systems required and more importantly the discerning palate and ample appetite to become a wine trading and distribution centre in asia
6977466 the credit squeeze has left people with far fewer options when trying to deal with rising unsecured debt the normal boulevard of remortgaging to pay off unsecured debts has been severely narrowed and the reduction of mortgage products available is resulting in many to consider formal insolvency
6977467 it would seem that men are generally falling into debt more rapidly than women as many try to maintain their traditional role as the familys main provider at the expense of getting further into debt
6977468 for years women have worked and struggled to gain equality the fight is not over but women have the largest opportunity of any group to benefit from the generosity of the government and private foundations programs
6977469 minority owned businesses grew more than four times as fast as u s firms overall since 1992
6977470 every year over 500 000 women start their own business in fact 2 out of 3 new businesses are started by women
6977471 i had left law about five years before becoming an actioncoach to pursue entrepreneurship for me while the law firm i was at was a great well established and highly ethical firm the practice of law was ultimately unfulfilling
6977472 actioncoach business coaches and attorneys both provide professional services in the form of advice clients may not want to even hear for a fee
6977473 there is also a need for continuing education as well as developing interpersonal and relationship building skills in both these professions
6977474 lawyers can only help businesses in a limited way by illuminating legal risks which flow from particular business decisions coaching is about getting into the business nuts and bolts
6977475 while there are some lawyers who provide advice on non legal business issues it is inappropriate to do so since they are not trained in this area they are trained to be risk averse which is not consistent with entrepreneurial decision making
6977476 as a coach you are looked upon as part of the team as a lawyer you are perceived as a necessary evil also lawyers are less interested in the personal side of things and want to focus on the issues coaches spend a lot of time developing not only businesses but also people
6977477 lawyers have to do the work coaches instruct and motivate the clients to do the work unlike lawyers they are not bogged down by strenuous paperwork
6977478 as an actioncoach i am able to do the things i cannot as a lawyer which includes but is not limited to achieving 300 400 business growth increasing margins by 25 implementing recruiting practices that improve the quality of hiring while reducing the cost of doing so helping clients to grow as leaders
6977479 they say law schools are full of smart people who cant think of anything better to do for me it wasnt quite that i had many interests ranging from politics to international relations to entrepreneurship and believed law school would be a potential learning platform
6977480 however being able to look at the bigger picture is more important than anything else
6977481 industrial classifieds combines the best of social networking with on line marketing by providing the tools and resources companies needs to promote their products and locate customers
6977482 whether a company needs abrasives machine tools heavy equipment chemicals packaging supplies forklifts machined parts or any other product or service for their manufacturing facility or construction site industrial classifieds can help them locate the most suitable suppliers in local national and international markets
6977483 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6977484 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6977485 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6977486 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6977487 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6977488 quest ces service and technology orientation and emphasis on client service have provided a solid foundation for our tremendous growth

6977491 deborah has a wealth of knowledge and brings a valuable perspective to any project or conversation she is not afraid to break down barriers and challenge boundaries to make things happen but she does so in a way that is enlightening and non threatening if you need someone to build a positive culture of diversity in your organization deborah is the right person to facilitate the process
6977492 it is one thing to understand and value diversity yet another to engage in a process of deepening that understanding through exposure to perspectives we dont always come across in our day to day working and social lives the global leadership class has provided just such a perspective chattanooga is better for it
6977493 the global leadership class broadened my perspective on the social and educational imperative of diversity bridging the educational gaps in our society and the social borders in our global world
6977494 one of the challenges of having been around so long for the past decade in morristown has been keeping our own website looking new and fresh
6977495 we spend a lot of time working on our clients projects that we tend to neglect our own
6977496 sure weve worked on some very complex projects for big business over the years
6977497 but with the re launch of our website we wanted to let the local community know that we are still committed to working with small and local businesses right here in new jersey the experience weve had developing and marketing some of these big companies with big budgets on google and yahoo have given us a clear competitive advantage when it comes to targetting local and regional customers
6977498 after 10 years in business in a very fast paced and competitive market like the web you really appreciate the fact that there is no room for a learning curve
6977499 if we didnt we wouldnt have been in business for 10 years
6977500 we have an incredibly talented group of carpenters and thoreaus cabin provided us with a fun and unique project to highlight those talents it was quite a project for a little cabin but the value this structure will have for tyler arboretum and the community at large is immeasurable
6977501 thoreaus life and his writings have influenced the world beyond measure we hope this replica will help carry on that environmental spiritual and civic legacy

6977504 i love that it will be easy to use for the parents and the girls it looks so refreshing
6977505 through targeted after school and summer educational and sports programs they are giving girls the tools to build self esteem marketable skills and a sense of purpose and by leveraging our technical talents we are able to support their mission of inspiring all girls to be strong smart and bold while sharing that mission with a global audience for local impact

6977544 almost everyday there are news segments on the economy and a looming recession unemployment rates are at record highs and everyone around the country is feeling the effects of the poor economy some families are even struggling to meet basic living expenses such as food and transportation and therefore cant repay their owed back taxes these families are ideal candidates for what is known as placement on the irs currently not collectible status
6977545 each client owed on average approximately 48 000 00 with the highest single tax liability being nearly 480 000 00 most of the clients cases were successfully concluded within one year but it is important to remember that the amount of time it takes to negotiate a settlement with the irs depends on a variety of factors including how quickly the taxpayer can provide financial documents requested by the irs

6977547 sometimes people do not realize that they have options the irs is willing to negotiate and even cease collections if you show them you cannot afford to fully repay your tax liability the lawyers at my law firm are skilled at negotiating with the irs and know how to get taxpayers the resolutions they deserve

6977571 i was rushing to a nearby kiosk to buy milk but was attacked by a man brandishing a knife
6977572 as i pondered my next move the man appeared and asked me where i was headed
6977573 he carried me shoulder high up to his house where i met the other woman
6977574 we have been thinking and this is not new that something has to be done for the last two years we have been thinking of a tool to use to close all cases of past corruption so that we can release the energy to fight current ones
6977575 since 2003 we have not been able to move much on the account of old cases of corruption very few cases are in court and not even all goldenberg and anglo leasing cases have been taken to court
6977576 for how many years are we going to go on with the circus that is created by the inability of our judicial system
6977577 we will not be re inventing the wheel because this has been done elsewhere those ready to own up and restore to public ownership what they irregularly acquired will be pardoned it does not need to be 100 per cent
6977578 when i made such proposals two years ago i was accused of seeking to cover up for people involved in anglo leasing however now that we have a grand coalition government we have to move ahead

6977594 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6977595 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control or any one gang dominating any of the criminal activities
6977596 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
6977597 it is clear that the public is indignant is angry and it has a right to be
6977598 if we are not able to reach agreements and channel these demands into clear and concrete steps then yes people could start taking other types of action that wouldnt solve the problem or benefit anyone

6977647 the way of the samurai is found in death meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily every day when ones body and mind are at peace one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows rifles spears and swords being carried away by surging waves being thrown into the midst of a great fire being struck by lightning being shaken to death by a great earthquake falling from thousand foot cliffs dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of ones master and every day without fail one should consider himself as dead this is the substance of the way of the samurai

6977655 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6977656 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6977657 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6977658 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6977659 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6977660 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6977661 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6977662 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6977663 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6977664 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6977665 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6977666 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6977667 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6977668 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6977669 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6977670 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6977671 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6977672 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6977673 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6977674 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6977675 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6977676 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6977677 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6977678 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6977679 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6977680 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6977681 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6977682 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6977683 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6977684 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6977685 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6977686 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6977687 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6977688 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6977689 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6977690 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6977691 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6977692 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6977693 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6977694 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6977695 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6977696 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6977697 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6977698 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6977699 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6977700 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6977701 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6977702 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6977703 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6977704 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6977705 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6977706 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6977707 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6977708 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6977709 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6977710 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6977711 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6977712 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6977713 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6977714 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6977715 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6977716 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6977717 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6977718 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6977719 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6977720 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6977721 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6977722 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6977723 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6977724 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6977776 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along and they dont have fundamental disagreements on major policies
6977777 i would yeah if john kerry said thats who he wanted and mccain id encourage mccain to say yes i doubt whether john would do it i doubt whether john mccain would do it but you know we need some unity here man the red states and the blue states weve got to have something to coalesce around here

6977841 with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all

6977861 in my gut it tells me if you put hillary on that ticket its like johnson and kennedy
6977862 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
6977863 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question

6977914 of the two other kinds of healing which are spiritual that is to say where the means of cure is a spiritual power one results from the entire concentration of the mind of a strong person upon a sick person when the latter expects with all his concentrated faith that a cure will be effected from the spiritual power of the strong person to such an extent that there will be a cordial connection between the strong person and the invalid the strong person makes every effort to cure the sick patient and the sick patient is then sure of receiving a cure from the effect of these mental impressions an excitement of the nerves is produced and this impression and this excitement of the nerves will become the cause of the recovery of the sick person so when a sick person has a strong desire and intense hope for something and hears suddenly the tidings of its realization a nervous excitement is produced which will make the malady entirely disappear in the same way if a cause of terror suddenly occurs perhaps an excitement may be produced in the nerves of a strong person which will immediately cause a malady the cause of the sickness will be no material thing for that person has not eaten anything and nothing harmful has touched him the excitement of the nerves is then the only cause of the illness in the same way the sudden realization of a chief desire will give such joy that the nerves will be excited by it and this excitement may produce health to conclude the complete and perfect connection between the spiritual doctor and the sick person that is a connection of such a kind that the spiritual doctor entirely concentrates himself and all the attention of the sick person is given to the spiritual doctor from whom he expects to realize health causes an excitement of the nerves and health is produced but all this has effect only to a certain extent and that not always for if someone is afflicted with a very violent disease or is wounded these means will not remove the disease nor close and heal the wound that is to say these means have no power in severe maladies unless the constitution helps because a strong constitution often overcomes disease this is the third kind of healing but the fourth kind of healing is produced through the power of the holy spirit this does not depend on contact nor on sight nor upon presence it is not dependent upon any condition whether the disease be light or severe whether there be a contact of bodies or not whether a personal connection be established between the sick person and the healer or not this healing takes place through the power of the holy spirit

6977985 el culto argentino del color local es un reciente culto europeo que los nacionalistas deber an rechazar por for neo
6977986 por eso digo que no debemos temer y que debemos pensar que nuestro patrimonio es el universo ensayar todos los temas y no podemos concretarnos a lo argentino para ser argentinos porque o ser argentino es una fatalidad y en ese caso lo seremos de cualquier modo o ser argentino es una mera afectaci n una m scara
6977987 he encontrado d as pasados una curiosa confirmaci n de que lo verdaderamente nativo suele y puede prescindir del color local encontr esta confirmaci n en la historia de la declinaci n y ca da del imperio romano de gibbon gibbon observa que en el libro rabe por excelencia en el alcor n no hay camellos yo creo que si hubiera alguna duda sobre la autenticidad del alcor n bastar a esta ausencia de camellos para probar que es rabe fue escrito por mahoma y mahoma como rabe no ten a por qu saber que los camellos eran especialmente rabes eran para l parte de la realidad no ten a por qu distinguirlos en cambio un falsario un turista un nacionalista rabe lo primero que hubiera hecho es prodigar camellos caravanas de camellos en cada p gina pero mahoma como rabe estaba tranquilo sab a que pod a ser rabe sin camellos creo que los argentinos podemos parecernos a mahoma podemos creer en la posibilidad de ser argentinos sin abundar en color local
6977988 qu es el oriente si lo definimos de un modo geogr fico nos encontramos con algo bastante curioso y es que parte del oriente ser a el occidente o lo que para los griegos y romanos fue el occidente ya que se entiende que el norte de frica es el oriente desde luego egipto es oriente tambi n y las tierras de israel el asia menor y bactrania persia la india todos esos pa ses que se extienden m s all y que tienen poco en com n entre ellos as por ejemplo trataria la china el jap n todo eso es el oriente para nosotros al decir oriente creo que todos pensamos en principio en el oriente isl mico y por extensi n en el oriente del norte de la india

6977991 de esas arbitrariedades del pensamiento elevadas a formas ya no s qu opinar
6977992 estamos conversando en un ilustre dialecto del lat n que se llama lengua castellana y ello tambi n es un episodio de esa nostalgia de ese comercio amoroso y a veces belicoso del oriente y del occidente ya que am rica fue descubierta por el deseo de llegar a las indias llamamos indios a la gente de moctezuma de atahualpa de catriel precisamente por ese error porque los espa oles creyeron haber llegado a las indias esa m nima conferencia m a tambi n es parte de ese di logo del oriente y el occidente
6977993 hay algo que sentimos como oriente que yo no he sentido en israel y que he sentido en granada y en c rdoba he sentido la presencia del oriente y eso no se si puede definirse pero no s si vale la pena definir algo que todos sentimos ntimamente las connotaciones de esa palabra se la debemos al libro de las mil y una noches es lo primero que pensamos s lo despu s podemos pensar en marco polo o en las leyendas del preste juan en aquellos r os de arena con peces de oro en primer t rmino pensamos en el islam

6978028 he is a bridge to a life that i had been missing theres people talking to me theres people talking to me that i had pushed away and didnt want to talk to before you lose trust with ptsd hes what i call a bridge to life
6978029 she called me and i had to ask who it was because it wasnt the same sown voice her voice has lifted
6978030 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
6978031 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6978032 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities

6978042 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6978043 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6978044 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6978045 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6978046 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6978047 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6978048 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6978049 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6978050 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6978051 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6978052 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6978053 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6978054 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6978055 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work

6978072 we moved in here after the first one was destroyed most of the underground rooms had remained intact and our old place was getting a little crowded i go by john hart now so make sure to call me that when my staff is around
6978073 i got pulled here during a fucked up time jump and my vortex manipulator broke
6978074 that was eleven years ago i got a job at torchwood which wasnt hard with my experience in the field and quickly made my way through the ranks
6978075 with all this alien and future stuff stored here you must have found a way to fix your vm right
6978076 i wish the stuff we have here isnt that advanced and there wasnt much left of my vm in the first place we might be able to put some of the pieces together to get into space at least but time travel is a bit out of the question our authority when it comes to that matter says theres no way to build a time machine out of the stuff weve got here
6978077 well space travel is still better than being stuck on this planet
6978078 i said we might we have the pieces but not the knowledge wed need to put them together in a way that works
6978079 since youre the boss here shouldnt you be at the centre of events
6978080 thats were were going but thank you for telling me how to do my job im touched by your concern
6978081 and im touched you deserted your work just to pick me up
6978082 that has been done this as well these calculations need to be put into the main computer
6978083 this is you trying to have me figure out the calibrations of the kryk weapon for you nice try
6978084 speak english so we can understand what you are saying
6978085 and since im trying to make them see reason not you it would be rather stupid to have you understand me but not them
6978086 i dont believe they cant understand us it would be irrational to start an invasion without being able to communicate with the locals
6978087 if you excuse me sir i dont think there is any risk of them conspiring against us
6978088 we will run the record though the translation programs later he knows that
6978089 a pathetic little calculation its not worth the consequences of disobedience
6978090 it is youre asking me to give you a weapon that could blow up worlds i cant imagine any use of that i would approve of
6978091 were not going to blow up this world so whats it to you
6978092 well have it your way well see how long it takes for you to come to your senses id say five for the beginning unless you changed your mind
6978093 ill also ask to guys from level three to stay a little longer
6978094 because hes an enemy of torchwood a danger to all of humanity
6978095 ill have to take care of him for a while
6978096 one of my staff will show you around ill meet you later
6978097 hes a prisoner here hes usually locked up unless they need him for something
6978098 hes the reason torchwood was created to protect the british empire from beings like him i dont think there was an actual reason for them to arrest him apart from the fact that the opportunity presented itself i cant say for sure though hes been here since before i joined the organization
6978099 what did they talk about before they took him away
6978100 i dont know i never get to see him unless hes allowed in the main area i dont know what they are doing to him in his cell or the laboratories
6978101 hes a criminal but hes saving the world hes a danger to the planet but hes been kept alive for forty years why not just execute him it would be much easier
6978102 i suppose theyre afraid that the world will end if hes no longer there to save it
6978103 what exactly is so dangerous about him that they need to lock him up for four decades
6978104 he can save the world with a snap of his fingers he could just as well destroy it
6978105 this was a good day for him no testing no drugs
6978106 i thought you didnt know what they do to him
6978107 i dont exactly but my wife is working with the medical staff you could say shes his personal nurse she doesnt see what they do as well but she sees the effects it has on him
6978108 i never got the chance to get to know him very well
6978109 but i know for sure that hes not a bad person
6978110 downright bastard that one i dont know what hed do if we werent watching him but it wouldnt be good believe me
6978111 torchwood two caught him in 1969 just after it had been re founded but his time machine has been lost apparently torchwood had hold of it once before i got here but now there is no trace of it and hes not helping anyone that selfish bastard dont get your hopes up
6978112 mr jones seems to think hes not a bad guy
6978113 ah dear ianto he has a strange affection for the doctor out of some misguided gratitude i dont want my people sympathising with my prisoners and would have him removed but he makes damn good coffee dont you think besides hes nice to look at as is his wife
6978114 for the same reasons on the other hand its quite good to have someone care for him who might not kill him the moment i turn my back some days hes really not very popular with the guards
6978115 im having her replaced a doctor from torchwood three is taking her place
6978116 four well three now with the first gone also there are a lot of people working for us without knowing it you remember professor richard lazarus
6978117 the scientist who jumped to his death last month the tabloids said he turned into a monster just before that
6978118 just the doctor in forty years no one could make him reveal his real name and believe me theyve tried i have tried
6978119 i want to go home you want to go home he says he cant help me but i dont believe him maybe you can talk some sense into him
6978120 if you couldnt make him talk then i certainly wont
6978121 i admit that im getting something out of it myself but you would profit from it as well i promise im a time traveller
6978122 my vortex manipulator broke and ive been stuck here for years
6978123 even if i could why should i help you youre with torchwood you wouldnt do anything good with it
6978124 i just want to go home and never come here again help me and ill get you out of here i promise
6978125 you cant get me out i wouldnt advice you to try others have over the years no
6978126 because they wouldnt even know why they should first thing id do was travel back to 1969 and keep you from getting captured in the first place youd never even be here that would be forty years im sure you wouldnt miss

6978147 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the uncoordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
6978148 our reports from our own forces on the ground are only so far that those killed in the strikes were 30 and they were all militants
6978149 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
6978150 know me for what i do and for not what i am judge me for what i can do and not for what i have done
6978151 i would find it difficult to go to my colleagues in the congress to say give us more money when i know that denver is a large part of the problem

6978153 theres no such thing as bad weather just wrong clothes

6978155 it told me that they dont believe all the damage was caused by the construction even though all these buildings were fine before they started
6978156 well either write them a check and they get it repaired or our contractor can make the repairs
6978157 but its been six months since the loop opened and it hits me every time i go out in the yard
6978158 we can hear the road in our beds at night especially when the 18 wheelers do that decompression thing they do
6978159 as far as i know nobody has heard a word about the committee

6978165 yall do i have to do the splits im a christian
6978166 i think its a bad idea in a way because youd have more people running around drunk
6978167 when people are 18 theyre old enough to move to college and live by themselves so why arent they able to drink
6978168 i know the emotional response of youre old enough to fight in the war but you cant buy beer and thats a point thats difficult to reject
6978169 but alcohol has an effect on some people that maturity alone can manage
6978170 theres evidence out there that indicates that younger persons that are drinking are prone to many injuries and accidents and that drinking leads to behavioral issues
6978171 on a college campus it could also lead to poor performance academically
6978172 id like to see some more data about the law and what the consequences are of what we do
6978173 i would not be in favor of lowering the age without some kind of education along the way i dont think young people understand what the consequences of excessive drinking are
6978174 thats our tradition to discern to talk to have meetings
6978175 arent necessarily wired to tell them when enough alcohol is enough
6978176 the evidence is pretty clear that the earlier you start using alcohol the greater the possibility of your developing problems from alcohol later on
6978177 were considered adults at 18 and we have to take on the responsibilities of an adult
6978178 i would need to see some studies i would need to see some surveys i would need to see some substantive and substantial research that would answer that and i dont think sufficient research has been done in that area
6978179 the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak i choose to believe that love rather than hatred is the law of development
6978180 i want to be involved in macedonia and iceland i wouldnt be here if i didnt

6978182 after wednesdays game three players checked out of the teams opera hotel and moved to the grand hotel even though it was forbidden to do so

6978185 there is a limited choice for actresses who are already involved in a relationship
6978186 your personal life has an indirect impact on the offers that come your way once you are bonded into any relationship the choice is limited and one has to take right moves
6978187 its a mans industry and its never going to change there is no use pointing out our stand verbally or through action
6978188 these are things we are talking about and not getting a solution to
6978189 my view needs a debate and it cannot be a solution that could be accepted by all
6978190 dont create subsidies that make too much demand over your natural resources subsidies on power on fertiliser would only lead to too much utilisation
6978191 if you want people to be able to afford food than one alternative to food subsidy is to give higher wages like the nregs is an avenue to some extent think about it
6978192 we know the oil prices will be on a high and under such circumstance you cannot keep them down rising prices all the time by giving subsidies

6978195 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
6978196 obamas choice still leaves an experience gap or foreign policy doubts that the gop will exploit while reflecting a cynical gamble that one states electors will win him the election or a gamble that his change message wont alienate the base of older democratic voters

6978202 just four runs spread over a career of almost 20 years and more than 197 hours at the crease it is worth asking just how sure can we be that the number is correct
6978203 as it happens my recent research has shown that it could be wrong a tantalising clue to four missing runs has been found

6978207 at present uighurs do not feel secure anywhere in china including east turkestan as they are seen as political suspects by the prc chinese authorities
6978208 i am extremely concerned that the chinese government will launch a life and death struggle on the uighur people once the international communitys focus has shifted from china
6978209 such a move will further destabilize the region and is not in the best interest of china
6978210 i also urge the international community to speak out on behalf of uyghurs and to prevent imminent and systematic human rights abuses against a peaceful people
6978211 the explosion was so huge that it partially damaged around 40 nearby houses and shops

6978222 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6978225 ik kan niet beoordelen of de handtekening nog te vertrouwen is en gewoonlijk zou je verwachten dat het bedrijf nieuwe sleutels aanmaakt
6978226 als je de handtekeningen niet kunt vertrouwen dan is het twijfelachtig of de controles die je uitvoert zin hebben
6978227 op basis van ons huidige onderzoek blijven we vertrouwen hebben in de beveiliging van de mogelijkheden om softwarepakketten te ondertekenen
6978228 het punt is dat de handtekening bij mij vertrouwen moet wekken en niet bij redhat na een hack neemt mijn vertrouwen in een handtekening die eerder deze week nog misbruikt is alleen maar af

6978231 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made
6978232 a runner like usain bolt comes along once every 100 years
6978233 usain does his thing and he is not talking anyone down
6978234 why criticize him for doing his thing when the united states did it for years and years no one said a thing
6978235 we stuck together all the way we talked about it and i asked asafa if we could do this break the world record after speaking to him i had no doubt in my mind
6978236 i came here to perform and to help people enjoy themselves if you dont enjoy your job then it makes no sense
6978237 i will not change i will always be myself that is my personality it is just me having fun
6978238 the crowd looks forward to seeing me coming out i just like to make people happy they pay money to come and see a show
6978239 for all of you with young children i am truly sorry i was out of hand and i promise that i will be more careful
6978240 i know you are hurting but that is not an excuse for your language their are women and children in this room please stop
6978241 actually as you arose i was getting ready to come over and ask them to go to another room the other waiting area had no one in it
6978242 its so wonderful to be here in modesto in this beautiful performing arts center
6978243 trying to act as the grown up in the budget negotiations
6978244 the problem with using that kind of bullying language is that hes tried it in the past and it didnt work
6978245 i dont believe it shows strong backbone to have said no tax increases publicly for years and years and years and then to change your position overnight
6978246 these are all people that admire our great men and women who go to iraq and afghanistan look at what they risk they risk their lives thats heroic to be afraid of what the consequences are in budget votes i mean thats quite the opposite
6978247 nobody likes tax increases least of all the hard working taxpayers and the business men and women who pay them
6978248 however this budget this year is about more than tax increases
6978249 the governors framework may provide a unique opportunity to achieve flexible work days to guarantee a mandatory budget reserve to limit the growth of government and to permanently reduce the states tax rate
6978250 it was just my way of saying look i go and am willing to compromise and go beyond what i have said i will do and why dont you do the same thing
6978251 i try to let republicans know that its ok to go and do a tax increase that the state isnt going to come to an end
6978252 his point is you never make real change unless some people take a risk and hes right
6978253 but i dont think that calling us out hes frustrated lets face it

6978265 in england in the national team i dont believe it
6978266 i dont believe this because lampard tries to do the best job for the national team and for chelsea
6978267 one time in portugal when i lost a match against spain people waved the white handkerchiefs afterwards they said they wanted me out
6978268 they booed me many times as portugal manager and players sometimes what i try to do is give confidence to the player because people sometimes do not understand what is happening with the whole team
6978269 its not one player that makes a team it is 11 i think england have very good players and lampard is one of these players
6978270 i asked frank today are you sad he said no i said i know why you are sad because now you renewed your contract and you have money you have to think about how to spend it he laughed
6978271 i dont know what the player wright phillips is thinking about with regards to offers from other teams
6978272 if i have 24 to 25 players with me and three or four for two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
6978273 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
6978274 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
6978275 i am fully aware he has got his thing on september 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
6978276 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
6978277 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
6978278 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles
6978279 it will be a little bit longer for him but he is close he came back into training two days this week and was absolutely outstanding so it wont be long
6978280 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
6978281 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
6978282 it was just an amazing experience that you just dont get every day
6978283 now im in the finals again its been a good month for me
6978284 she was just ready to fight on every point and i started to feel a little bit tired
6978285 after it was worse and worse and finally at the end of the match the two last games i was out of the match
6978286 i would love to become no 1 in the world and win grand slams
6978287 i think everyone practicing this hard you know putting such an effort in it wants to become no 1 in the world but theres only one no 1 so you know you need to put some hard work in it you know i still have 21 spots to go and hopefully after this tournament i have a little bit less
6978288 i just lost the ball in the sky i dont know how it happened
6978289 i should serve better tomorrow definitely because i think wozniacki plays more aggressive than amelie does
6978290 thats also what i was missing i was not able to find these for the last month or so and it was pretty frustrating also to be on the court and a little bit like not really finding joy and happiness and motivation
6978291 at the beginning of the year my secret goal was to reach my first atp final and im really glad that i did it
6978292 i feel like with my serve and my serve game if i can get two breaks in a set ill feel pretty comfortable
6978293 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6978294 willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
6978295 we urge and expect the department of justice to fulfill its commitment to take prompt vigorous action to enforce against criminal violations of the campaign finance laws
6978296 crude disreputable and malicious attempt to link sen obama to domestic terrorist activities
6978297 these people need to study election law it is totally legal you can be sure we vetted and vetted and vetted it again
6978298 much much and all of it ugly even that which was glorious
6978299 whether it lasts just through today and a part of tomorrow or whether it lasts for a long life is the most important thing that can happen to a human being
6978300 its not cool with the sort of rebellious punk street artist types to support something that is seen as a part of the system
6978301 obamas a rock star hes got a great brand and hes a very sexy candidate
6978302 its pretty unusual to find things that street artists and graffiti artists are in support of
6978303 i could go and volunteer at the campaign and make calls but thats probably not the best use of my skill set
6978304 a conscious effort to position obama in a certain way to position him as cool and to position him as hip
6978305 sie haben sich nicht vollst ndig aus den gegenden zur ckgezogen die als nicht umstritten gelten
6978306 fortgesetzt und gem den verpflichtungen der russischen seite beendet werden
6978307 we have been and continue to work together to find opportunities to raise money
6978308 very pleased that so many who supported sen clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the obama campaign
6978309 it is all political spin in reality you have to pay off your own debt
6978310 hillary and her supporters are going to have pay off her debt were going to have do it ourselves
6978311 the way to win is to outspend the other guy
6978312 the reason that i gave to sen clinton is because ultimately this is about overcoming differences
6978313 is impacting the development of concepts such as enterprise 2 0
6978314 it may have been more valuable at one time but with meetups and internet connectivity i wonder if classrooms are going to go the way of business offices distributed open mobile
6978315 at the beginning of the 21st century in italy where is known as connettivismo it originated in italian

6978319 im still going to vote for him but i thought he was about inclusion and thats not what this event is
6978320 when the president came we had motorcades come to the front and back entrances
6978321 we just do whatever they ask its an honor having them stay here
6978322 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6978323 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6978324 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6978325 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6978326 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6978327 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6978328 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6978329 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6978330 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6978331 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6978332 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6978333 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet
6978334 making a global problem a local one people can see the specifics of how climate change affects their local economy and their local ecosystems
6978335 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6978336 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6978337 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6978338 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6978339 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6978340 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6978341 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6978342 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6978343 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6978344 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6978345 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6978346 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6978347 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6978348 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6978349 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6978350 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6978351 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6978352 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6978353 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
6978354 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6978355 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
6978356 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
6978357 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
6978358 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours

6978364 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6978365 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6978366 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6978367 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6978368 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6978369 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6978370 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6978371 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6978372 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6978373 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6978374 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6978375 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6978376 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
6978377 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6978378 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6978379 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6978380 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6978381 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6978382 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6978383 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6978384 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6978385 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6978386 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6978387 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6978388 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6978389 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6978390 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6978391 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6978392 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6978393 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6978394 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6978395 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6978396 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6978397 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6978398 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6978399 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6978400 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6978401 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6978402 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6978403 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6978404 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6978405 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6978406 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6978407 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6978408 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6978409 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6978410 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6978411 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6978412 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6978413 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6978414 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6978415 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6978416 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6978417 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6978418 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6978419 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
6978420 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
6978421 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
6978422 betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
6978423 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
6978424 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
6978425 every seat will be a great seat as we listen to barack obama communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the challenges americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
6978426 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6978427 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6978428 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6978429 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6978430 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6978431 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6978432 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6978433 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6978447 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6978452 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6978453 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6978454 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6978455 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6978456 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6978457 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6978458 as homage to peter bjorn and johns respective hometowns they wanted to feature the voice and dialect from each of the three areas so apart from the instrumental soundtrack to the lonely childhood of northern scandinavia you can also hear three monologues about some sort of seaside the stories are read by a real saxophone player from norsj a grandfather from vika and the hairdresser siw from pite
6978459 the memory of the sound of the swedish music school orchestras from hell
6978460 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6978461 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6978462 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6978463 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6978464 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6978465 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6978466 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected

6978468 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6978469 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6978470 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6978471 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6978472 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6978473 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6978474 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6978475 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6978476 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6978477 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6978478 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6978479 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6978480 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6978481 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6978482 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6978483 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6978484 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6978485 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6978486 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6978487 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6978488 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6978489 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6978490 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6978491 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6978492 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6978493 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6978494 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6978495 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6978496 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6978497 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6978498 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country

6978500 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6978501 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6978502 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6978503 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6978504 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6978505 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6978506 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6978507 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6978508 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true

6978512 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6978513 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6978514 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6978515 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6978516 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6978517 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

6978919 from far beyond time are 52 slide 53 we come o man traveled we from beyond the space time aye from the place of infinitys end when ye and all of thy brethren were formless formed forth were we from the order of all not as men are we though once we too were as men out of the great void were we formed forth in order and by law for know ye that that which is formed truly is formless having form only to thine eyes
6978920 child of the light o thoth art thou free to travel the bright path upward until at the last all ones become one forth were we formed after our order three four five and six seven eight nine know ye that these are the number of cycles that we descend from unto man each having here a duty to fulfill each having here a force to control yet are we one with the soul of our cycle yet are we too seeking a goal far beyond mans conception infinity extends into a greater than all there in a time that is yet not a time we shall all become one with a greater than all time and space are moving in circles know ye their law and ye too shall be free aye free shall ye be to move through the cycles pass the guardians that dwell at the door

6978922 all that ye know is but part of little not as yet have ye touched on the great far out in space where light reigns supreme came i into the light formed was i also but not as ye are body of light was my formless form formed know i not life and know i not death yet master am i of all that exists seek ye to find the path through the barriers travel the road that leads to the light
6978923 seek ye to find the path to beyond not impossible is it to grow to a consciousness above for when two have become one and one has become the all know ye the barrier has lifted and ye are made free of the road grow thou from form to the formless free may thou be of the road

6978928 the life in thee is the word find thou the life within thee and have powers to use of the word

6978932 know ye o thoth in the beginning there was void and nothingness a timeless spaceless nothingness and into the nothingness came a thought purposeful all pervading and it filled the void there existed no matter only force a movement a vortex of vibration of the purposeful thought that filled the void
6978933 in the beginning there was eternal thought and for thought to be eternal time must exist so into the all pervading thought grew the law of time aye time which exists through all space floating in a smooth rhythmic movement that is eternally in a state of fixation time changes not but all things change in time for time is the force that holds events separate each in its proper place time is not in motion but ye move through time as your consciousness moves from one event to another aye by time ye exist all in all an eternal one existence know ye that even though in time ye are separate yet still are one in all times existent
6978934 lords of the two horizons watchers of the treble gates stand ye one at the right and one at the left as the star rises to his throne and rules over his sign aye thou dark prince of arulu open the gates of the dim hidden land and release her whom ye keep imprisoned hear ye hear ye hear ye dark lords and shining ones and by their secret names names which i know and can pronounce hear ye and obey my will

6978936 o thoth great are ye among earths children but mysteries exist of which ye know not ye know that ye came from a space time below this and know ye shall travel to a space time beyond but little ye know of the mysteries within them little ye know of the wisdom beyond know ye that ye as a whole in this consciousness are only a cell in the process of growth the consciousness below thee is ever expanding in different ways from those known to thee aye it though in space time below thee is ever growing in ways that are different from those that were part of the ways of thine own for know that it grows as a result of thy growth but not in the same way that thou didst grow the growth that thou had and have in the present have brought into being a 76 slide 77 cause and effect no consciousness follows the path of those before it else all would be repetition and vain each consciousness in the cycle it exists in follows its own path to the ultimate goal each plays its part in the plan of the cosmos each plays its part in the ultimate end the farther the cycle the greater its knowledge and ability to blend the law of the whole know ye that ye in the cycles below us are working the minor parts of the law while we of the cycle that extends to infinity take of the striving and build greater law each has his own part to play in the cycles each has his work to complete in his way the cycle below thee is yet not below thee but only formed for a need that exists for know ye that the fountain of wisdom that sends forth the cycles is eternally seeking new powers to gain ye know that knowledge is gained only by practice and wisdom comes forth only from knowledge and thus are the cycles created by law means are they for the gaining of knowledge for the plane of law that is the source of the all the cycle below is not truly below but only different in space and in time the consciousness there is working and testing lesser things than those ye are and know just as ye are working on greater so above ye are those who are also working as ye are on yet other laws the difference that exists between the cycles is only in ability to work with the law we who have being in cycles beyond thee are those who first came forth from the source and have in the passage through time space gained ability to use laws of the greater that are far beyond the conception of man nothing there is that is really below thee but only a different operation of law look thee above or look thee below the same shall ye find for all is but part of the oneness that is at the source of the law the consciousness below thee is part thine own as we are a part of thine ye as a child had not the knowledge that came to ye when ye became a man compare ye the cycles to man in his journey from birth unto death and see in the cycle below thee the child with the 77 slide 78 knowledge he has and see ye yourself as the child grown older advancing in knowledge as time passes on see ye we also the child grown to manhood with the knowledge and wisdom that came with the years so also o thoth are the cycles of consciousness children in different stages of growth yet all from the one source the wisdom and all to the wisdom returning again
6978937 o thoth long have we sat in amenti guarding the flame of life in the halls yet know we are still part of our cycles with our vision reaching unto them and beyond aye know we that of all nothing else matters excepting the growth we can gain with our soul know we the flesh is fleeting the things men count great are nothing to us the things we seek are not of the body but are only the perfected state of the soul when ye as men can learn that nothing but progress of soul can count in the end then truly ye are free from all bondage free to work in a harmony of law know o man ye should aim at perfection for only thus can ye attain to the goal though ye should know that nothing is perfect yet it should be thy aim and thy goal
6978938 o men cease from thy striving against they brother only thus can ye come to the light cease from thy unbelief o my brother and follow the path and know ye are right
6978939 there is one even the first who hath no beginning who hath no end who hath made all things who govern all who is good who is just who illumines who sustains

6978942 a long time ago i in my childhood lay neath the stars on long buried atlantis dreaming of mysteries far above men then in my heart grew there a great longing to conquer the pathway that led to the stars year after year i sought after wisdom seeking new knowledge following the way until at last my soul in great travail broke from its bondage of earth man free from the body i flashed through the night unlocked at last for me was the star space free was i from the bondage of night now to the end of space sought i wisdom far beyond knowledge of finite man

6978970 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
6978971 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
6978972 we have the same problems around the country we cant just create a program to pay some people and not others
6978973 if the government of iraq doesnt decide to employ all of them you have jobless rates that skyrocket
6978974 we dont have a get out of jail free card for the sons of iraq there is law and order in this country and we respect the iraqi government

6978980 the name of johnny depp kept coming up everyone thought he would be ideal and it is the sort of interesting role he loves
6978981 a combination of mr depp and director tim burton would be a perfect match up

6978989 hes one of these lads that has always worked really hard and has been around since he was 16 somethings just clicked for him and at times he has bowled brilliantly this year hes growing as a bowler and hes definitely one for the future

6979002 jobbing 136 us 171 them theyre starting to pull away some
6979003 are we willing to match pay at 1800 last min
6979004 oh wow were actually outjobbing at the moment by 15 what was the decision
6979005 were gonna take out the ships we have loaded yes
6979006 and were gonna play for a seg or two and then call it a day i think
6979007 when i tested for staff sergeant there were 8 million of us and only four got promoted now a days all you have to do is sign your name on the test and you make staff sergeant

6979013 jerin tells me that over the centuries these boats have been rammed into rocks at full speed turned over by tempests attacked and set on fire by raiders and even deliberately sunk by pouring water into the holds
6979014 in every case once they were raised and cleaned out they were found to be in perfect working order only the woodwork and the simple fittings can be damaged and need regular replacement
6979015 they didnt call those people the magician kings for nothing
6979016 since we left boathaven the steam dragon has been working better than ever
6979017 according to jerin since we left boathaven they have needed less wood than usual and the engine has been much quieter he tells me that crew on other parts of the boat have reported the same thing isnt that weird
6979018 that is a move taught to me by my sword master in bagdor he in turn was taught it by david aldegar daniels father and by far the greatest swordsman who ever lived
6979019 the move is called the twisting snake and you have to be very good with a sword to even attempt it because if you get it wrong your own sword is likely to go flying away
6979020 which tells me what it was but not how it is done
6979021 which is why you have to get it exactly right
6979022 dont forget that even a disarmed enemy is still dangerous
6979023 i think what i was trying to show was dont get overconfident
6979024 when you fight someone better than you you have to fight sneakier to make up the gap
6979025 there is always someone better around the next bend for all of us
6979026 only those standing close enough to hear your rant at prince dor yesterday
6979027 i do not recall you standing anywhere near me when that happened
6979028 i would not have thought that was a particularly useful skill for a healer
6979029 the mine owners were always meddling in other peoples affairs are you about to meddle in those of slarn
6979030 i am a mine owner no longer the gold mines were all played out a year ago if the truth is to be told should i care about where tonas mallows swords end up
6979031 the swords may become the decisive factor in who finally takes over as slarns new king
6979032 the situation has worsened recently perhaps you noticed all the refugees onboard the flying kite
6979033 refugees carrying their gold and finery and bringing their household servants with them too ill be bound that is more in the nature of a vacation than a meaningful evacuation
6979034 true war is coming to slarn very soon lady klint whose side will you be on when it arrives
6979035 according to jerin it is the makers dedication mark for the boat he told me that there are similar plates on the other two boats in the fleet
6979036 i have been taught in the writing of the ancients
6979037 the last symbol is that of the king of slarn but i dont know what the other two symbols mean
6979038 keeper tib the twenty second the people of wegnar await your presence
6979039 i believe that the lady jalka has also spoken to them on your behalf
6979040 if the keeper would care to come with me to the balcony
6979041 i have been asked to speak to you on behalf of the council
6979042 as you all know the five gem coin was stolen two nights ago by the adventurer jalia aldare and her companion daniel aldegar they were assisted in their terrible crime by another as yet unidentified woman
6979043 is that jalia aldare had no interest in stealing the coin except as a means to punish our keeper for cheating her at cards she told me herself that a coin that shone magically was only marginally useful and i for one believe she was telling me the truth
6979044 the council has debated this matter at some length the coin is gone with jalia aldare to slarn and our keepers action on the steam dragon while pursuing his personal vendetta probably means it will be many months before we can send any of our men to slarn to recover it captain gregor has already volunteered to lead those men in their quest when travel between wegnar and slarn is resumed
6979045 the council was of a view to exile tib prentice to the steps of the north
6979046 however jalka prentice has spoken very eloquently at great length to us and has brought us around to her point of view
6979047 the council were in agreement that lady jalka shall act as regent for her son rond until he comes of age the title of keeper shall change to that of lord protector and lady jalka shall be known as lady protector until rond becomes a man
6979048 however to ensure that we protect ourselves from the prophesy as best we can exiling the keeper is insufficient it was lady jalka as our new lady protector who pointed this out to the council it is therefore the sombre but unanimous ruling of the council of advisors and the lady protector that the former keeper of the five gem coin tib the twenty second shall be taken to the hanging tree and thereupon shall be hung by the neck until he is dead
6979049 how can you continue to be part of jalia and daniels life youve been with them what three or four weeks and barely a day goes by when they arent killing somebody or risking your life along with theirs how can you stand it
6979050 dad told me that jalia killed one of the two guards that were holding the captain and first mate captive
6979051 he was only there because jalia stole the five gem coin
6979052 nobody knows that but us and besides which i dont think those men could even have known the coin had been taken by then jalia and daniel didnt arrive back from stealing it until after they were already on the boat
6979053 the point is that if you stay with them youll end up dead and i dont want that
6979054 they are my family now and they are so much better than the life i lived before
6979055 you dont have to live like this anymore stay on the dragon with me and dad im sure the captain will sign you on as part of the crew if we ask him
6979056 you dont have to make a decision now hala its over a week until we reach slarn assuming we ever reach slarn with jalia and daniel onboard
6979057 do you think that any force in the universe can stop those two from getting somewhere once they have set their minds to it
6979058 pull a sword on me and it wont be put back until one of the two of us is dead
6979059 you do not attempt to blackmail my secretary and you cannot blackmail me is that clear prince dor dalk youngest son of gilan dalk and currently third in line to the dalk trium in slarn
6979060 i only asked for bredan to be prepared to help if i should call on him
6979061 and do not lie to me it does not become a prince of the trium
6979062 i do not know why you are on the dragon with your retinue and slinking around like rats nor do i care there is no enmity between jalia aldare and myself those times are now past if you reveal who i am to her it will make this journey a little more uncomfortable for me but that is all however your father would lock you up in his dungeon if he knew you had been stupid enough to try and blackmail me
6979063 you are tred denger and this is your brother wilf is it not
6979064 the resemblance to your father is startling i must say that i am surprised he has trusted you on a venture this far from telmar on your own
6979065 my father met with an unfortunate accident a few days ago my lady what was once his business is now mine
6979066 i thought you had given your name as glan when you were rescued from the sailing ship
6979067 sometimes you do not seek the notoriety that your own name can give you there are places i could name where the mallow name should not be spoken too loudly it is the price of being in trade
6979068 your fortunes have certainly suffered a decline in recent time
6979069 yes but fortunes come and go it is part of the game that we traders play now what game brings three of telmars most successful traders out on the road to slarn
6979070 you said that one of the gems burnt you in the vault
6979071 the coin didnt want you to steal it from the vault
6979072 you have destroyed tib prentice wrecked his reputation among his friends and set the boat company at his throat if my sister were here she would thank you too i am in your debt
6979073 dad told me that gallys father deren sorn married his eldest daughter to tib prentice because it gave him control over wegnar
6979074 but i dont see how that would give her father any control over what tib does in wegnar
6979075 they have a five year old son who is being educated in slarn and currently lives with deren sorn
6979076 i dont understand what gally meant by causing tib trouble with the boat company
6979077 i suppose captain toren will report that they searched the steam dragon
6979078 thats why we pass messages on the river rather than simply picking them up at the next port captain toren will pass the word to the speedy star and they will not dock at wegnar they will pass the word onto the flying kite and neither will they
6979079 no boat company vessel will dock at wegnar after this possibly for years captain toren will speak to the shareholders when we get to slarn and they will decide how many months or years will go by before they approach wegnar about resuming trade even then they will launch a rowing boat from one of the boats to negotiate wegnar will probably have to pay a massive fine to the boat company if they want our boats to return we dont let anyone mess with our boats the mine owners tried it at telmar and we havent been there in years
6979080 nobody messes with our boats or our crew without being punished for it
6979081 you wake my sister up to take part in one of your adventures and leave me stuck in the boat playing with myself i thought that we had become friends
6979082 we are friends don but you lacked the necessary equipment to get us past the guards did cara not explain exactly how we did it
6979083 daniel made your sister strip down to a mere pair of knickers to satisfy his perverted sense of humour he has done the same to me many times i can tell you he claims such things are cunning plans but i have my doubts that it is anything more than a chance to see a girls charms
6979084 should i be ready to defend my sisters honour daniel
6979085 i swear i never touched her though i will admit to a certain amount of looking
6979086 he never mentions the lusting but believe me when i tell you it was there
6979087 true cara and they are all a disappointment in the end
6979088 were you injured last night i noticed how carefully you are sitting down
6979089 only to me i have been doing it a lot myself recently
6979090 my reason is much the same as yours daniel was very angry with me last night
6979091 it was his right to punish me as i broke our rules
6979092 hello sir may i ask you a question regarding my stolen golden toilet seat
6979093 golden toilet seat boy would i like to see that
6979094 yes it means the world to me and i really want it back and was wondering if you could tell me of its whereabouts
6979095 i havent seen such a thing but i will help you find this mythical beast of a toilet seat
6979096 my name is brian bachtel i may not look it ut i can shave a monkey bald in ten seconds flat
6979097 thats quite the skill brian i think i could use a person like you on my journey
6979098 this place is weird man if your toilet seat is anywhere it is surely here
6979099 i think your right but what does this person want with my toilet seat and how did he know about it
6979100 beats me riley i guess we will have to see
6979101 what do you think you are doing do you think you can just take my stuff and leave without consequence
6979102 what makes yu think you can steal stuff from people and take it for yourself
6979103 yes riley i took your beloved toilet seat because you didnt deserve it i truly wanted it and you never let me even once touch it
6979104 if it meant that muh i would have let you touched it but stealing is a little harsh dont you think
6979105 no you treated that thing like royalty always looking at it and sitting there admiring it all day you never came over and played cards or just came to hang out because you were always too busy wiht that stupid toilet seat
6979106 get in boys unless you want to stick around with this guy
6979107 ill get that golden toilet if its the last thing i do mark my words it will be mine
6979108 you know at first all i wanted was to get my golden toilet seat back but now i realized that meeting you was way better than any moment i had with that seat
6979109 really i felt the same way all i ever did was shave monkeys all day and now i have a friend
6979110 well this is my stop i guess ill talk to you later

6979146 es ist f r die menschen nur sehr schwer zu verstehen warum wir tausend leute brauchen um zwei autos einzusetzen
6979147 das ist meine philosophie es ist zu viel wir fahren rennen aber alle vergessen was die ffentlichkeit wirklich will
6979148 trotzdem ist das ein besonderes rennen f r mich denn es ist mein heimspiel sogar mein erstes denn ich bin in barcelona nicht gefahren
6979149 aber in den letzten beiden runden wurde ich im verkehr aufgehalten und konnte meine zeit nicht mehr verbessern die konkurrenz konnte das und ich wurde bis auf rang 15 nach hinten gereicht
6979150 auf jeden fall hat es heute schon richtig spa gemacht wir bekommen immer mehr grip und k nnen immer sp ter bremsen
6979151 es sind nur mehr sechs wochen bis zum wichtigsten zweirad rennen in diesem land und die australier zeigen ihre begeisterung f r diesen sport mehr denn je
6979152 wegen des limitierten platzes gibt es auch nur eine limitierte anzahl an trib nen die wir bauen k nnen 2007 wurden alle trib nenkarten schon vor dem rennen verkauft da die kartenverk ufe schon h her sind als zum vergleichszeitraum im vorjahr raten wir den fans eindringlich ihre tickets jetzt zu kaufen im muss aber auch noch betonen sollte jemand keine trib nenkarte mehr bekommen dann gibt es auch noch normale eintrittskarten
6979153 das lief heute nicht besonders gut ich habe halt heute fr h schon ber zehn minuten durch ein elektronikproblem verloren das ist ein drittel des freien trainings gerade auf einer neuen strecke ger t man da schon mal von anfang an ins hintertreffen zum gl ck bin ich ja wenigstens vor vier wochen hier das formel 3 training gefahren hatte dadurch wenigstens eine idee von der strecke sonst w re das das absolute desaster gewesen
6979154 wir haben wohl auch technisch mit den nderungen zwischen dem freien training und dem qualifying nicht alles richtig gemacht und vielleicht habe ich auch nicht das wirklich optimalste heraus geholt
6979155 f r mich war der sprung zwischen den beiden sessions extrem gro was den grip anging einmal durch die streckenver nderungen aber auch durch das was wir am auto gemacht haben dadurch war das fahrverhalten v llig anders dazu kam da noch ein menge verkehr leute die im weg standen irgendwo angeeckt sind ein haufen chaos
6979156 in der autoindustrie gibt es immer mehr joint ventures nur wir in der formel 1 versuchen alle das rad neu zu erfinden in der serie f hrt ein mini cooper mit einem motor der bei peugeot entwickelt wurde daran st rt sich keiner nur bei uns muss jeder seine teile selbst bauen
6979157 dito que lhe atribu do para ilustrar o seu apre o pela utilidade
6979158 ich habe ihn jeder runde verkehr gehabt und wurde aufgehalten ausgenommen meiner ersten und der letzten runde
6979159 das rennen ist lang und es kann viel passieren die strecke ist schwer und es wird sehr hei
6979160 jetzt m ssen wir uns nur noch eine gute strategie berlegen doch es kommt auch auf das gl ck an denn hier kann wirklich alles passieren
6979161 es ist eine neue strecke da werden sicher einige leute bl dsinn machen
6979162 die chancen dass etwas passiert stehen sicherlich sehr hoch ich versuche einem m glichen chaos zu entgehen und als erster in die erste kurve einzubiegen
6979163 zudem werden wir morgen noch mehr grip haben wenn die formel 1 ihr qualifying absolviert hat
6979164 deshalb werden sie auch morgen nicht z gern und das safety car bei einem unfall sofort rausschicken es wird mehr als nur eine gelbphase geben
6979165 doch in valencia noch mehr als auf anderen normalen strecken
6979166 wenn vorne ein unfall passiert dann wird man hinten kaum ausweichen k nnen dazu gibt es einfach zu wenig fluchtwege
6979167 die strecke ist schon gef hrlich es ist alles viel breiter und schneller als monaco aber trotzdem passiert schnell ein fehler und man h ngt in der mauer ich war heute selbst ein paar mal kann dran

6979192 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6979193 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6979194 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6979195 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america

6979197 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6979198 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6979199 even though it requires work to develop strategies not to be a puppet on a string you could perhaps overcome these influences
6979200 automatic mental associations have the potential to distort peoples perceptions of reality
6979201 biased perception of the information provides the basis for future decisions leading them in one direction or another
6979202 the distorting influence of perception on reality is particularly pronounced when the information is ambiguous and in the political domain we often have to deal with ambiguous information
6979203 what these guys did thats particularly nice is follow people through the process
6979204 the basic structure of what theyre talking about could apply to political and social decisions
6979205 its much easier to create a negative association technically its possible to create a positive association but you need to work much harder
6979206 from the perspective of a voter who doesnt want to be a slave of their automatic mental associations our study can inform people of how their mind works and resolve the unawareness of unawareness
6979207 you can practice changing your cognition and being a little more thoughtful about how you approach things
6979208 the research now is looking at what strategies will change this

6979213 a scientist cites evidence showing non scientists are not like scientists
6979214 the test you took did not tell you that you
6979215 the article is clearly biased in one somewhat amusing way every single example of an attack ad is against a democratic candidate
6979216 not like a democrat has ever run any famous attack ads right
6979217 automatic mental associations have the potential to distort peoples perceptions of reality
6979218 biased perception of the information provides the basis for future decisions leading them in one direction or another

6979222 when the average black man in the street has a problem he says call that najee brother
6979223 the police wanted to get him the d a the old guard because he was a thorn in their side
6979224 najee didnt realize how much the system wanted to be done with him
6979225 najee couldnt bribe anybody he doesnt have any money when i heard that i almost fell out of my chair
6979226 but i respect that he puts himself out there like that when others dont
6979227 the theater was an anchor for what was an elegant neighborhood built around one of los angeles important open spaces
6979228 this ties in wonderfully with the positive things that everyone is trying to bring back to the park
6979229 it gives us another project to take to the world and say come to macarthur park
6979230 why dont they go to other communities and do this
6979231 we feel at home here as if were in our country macarthur park has been a witness to all of our struggles
6979232 but now they think were about to close or already closed so they dont come anymore

6979235 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6979236 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979237 after the number of violent incidents against researchers it seems to me they do need some additional protection over and above what the criminal law provides now
6979238 i dont want the law interfering with people getting information
6979239 on behalf of my dog hed like to remain intact
6979240 what works for mr levine in los angeles county wont necessarily work in alpine or modoc county
6979241 i would not rush for that deadline just to get a bad deal
6979242 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979243 i was an irish catholic kid who thought it had not changed i admit one of my real dilemmas is i have two kids who went to ivy league schools im not sure my grandfather finnegan will ever forgive me for allowing that to happen but all kidding aside i wasnt a big princeton fan
6979244 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
6979245 i will not cut one single solitary cent of the money that we need to build those vehicles to protect these kids and they cost billions of dollars
6979246 playing the populism card the idea that rich are bad poor are good the nobility of america lies in the poor i think thats a losing general election argument i think its a losing argument period
6979247 the rich are as patriotic as the poor if you ask of them
6979248 i knew what the political vote was it was to vote no
6979249 i had bets with my staff that every one of the senators who were running for president would vote against it even though they knew better i went ahead and voted for the funding
6979250 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6979251 i didnt take senator bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
6979252 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that either the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
6979253 some have taken totally out of context my use of the word clean
6979254 with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all
6979255 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979256 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6979257 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6979258 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6979259 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6979260 will i be welcomed back as an m c elder

6979264 i think saddam either has to be separated from his weapons or taken out of power

6979300 the court recognized that their opinion in the 1980s held that the elements of gratuitous violence were met but now 24 years later that same evidence is insufficient to satisfy heinousness and depravity
6979301 we will have to analyze the opinion more carefully and talk to the attorney generals office
6979302 i can say that this is probably the most heinous murder case ive seen
6979303 the supreme court really makes it important that you have to factor in the mental state of that particular defendant
6979304 he prays to die he thinks he deserves to be punished
6979305 i hope the county attorneys office really takes a good look at the lengthy history of this case
6979306 i hope they decide that the life sentence mandated for insalaco is appropriate as well for the crimes against the children
6979307 we did work so hard for senator clinton to make her the nominee it is really hard to deal with but we know that senator obama was and is a great candidate
6979308 in my gut it tells me if you put hillary on that ticket its like johnson and kennedy
6979309 i would have rather him stayed on the street and get some street justice im very upset that i cant do nothing about it im very upset that this dude took the sucker way out and turned himself in im mad and angry

6979327 in my opinion each one of them would want to be there and will be there that president will want to demonstrate to the world that the u s represented by chicago wants to welcome the world back to the united states
6979328 of course he will be there and we can enjoy his support

6979360 the ability of most market indicators is found to be weak while the ability of the skyscraper index to predict severe changes in the business cycle is strong
6979361 how could something bad come of building the worlds biggest skyscraper after all bigger is better having the biggest building on earth can be a source of national pride
6979362 clearly there was a capital oriented boom in the construction of ever taller buildings before the great depression
6979363 structural rationale for such a tall structure is technically and economically inescapable
6979364 architecture simply doesnt count with pitifully few exceptions in the past new yorks skyscrapers have never reached for anything but money
6979365 structural principles of the tall building developed by the turn of the century have remained essentially unchanged
6979366 i think there are financial forces working to make this happen
6979367 modern economics has great difficulty in dealing with real world capital goods and mainstream economists have gone to great pains to ignore the heterogeneity of capital
6979368 skyscraper construction can be expected to closely follow even small changes in relative prices
6979369 higher interest rates discourage the building of taller buildings and of construction in general because capital is scarcer and land is less in demand and available at lower prices

6979427 i think the challenge will be mentally to become a cricketer again at the moment im certainly not a cricketer
6979428 to be going back and forth is a bit awkward and will be a challenge
6979429 ill have to wait and see how i deal with it
6979430 im trying to put something together that gives me an opportunity to get some cricket under my belt and play well and contribute
6979431 so if it can take place then i will certainly do it if not then i will just have to batten down the hatches over there
6979432 turning up cold against shoaib akhtar and brett lee doesnt excite me that much
6979433 i want to play in the ashes and i think realistically ive to try and get back in the next six or seven months if not the start of next summer
6979434 so games for yorkshire are crucial and hopefully go to india and force my way in the team
6979435 if not the caribbean they are two teams ive had a lot of success against
6979436 and then early next summer sri lanka if they come and then the big ashes series
6979437 im fortunate in the next year im playing the four teams ive got the best record against
6979438 so confidence will be high the buzz of wanting to get out there is there i want to bat
6979439 i honestly dont care i want to get in the team
6979440 i know i havent played anywhere near how i can play although that has been the mental side of the game
6979441 the only way to get through that is to go and play long innings for yorkshire
6979442 i havent played a long innings for a while and thats what i want to try and do play that six seven hour innings get 150 200 try and help them win a game or two and get that feeling of just batting
6979443 i believe the captain should pick the 11 for five years i never had an 11 on the pitch that i havent wanted
6979444 there have been times when weve picked squads of 16 for touring where id have had another player for other players but through my time ive always had the 11 ive wanted and i believe that is exactly how it should be
6979445 in and around that team the captain has to be the one that makes big decisions and he is the one that should guide the team in the direction that he wants that team to go in and how they want to play with the coach
6979446 its very important the captain has a big say because he is at the forefront of everything the team does so he has to be at the forefront of all the decision making
6979447 they are totally different peter is his own man ive had to resign because my mind has told me enough is enough
6979448 this summer we were starting to get a relationship going it always takes time to build that relationship and trust and there were some good things happening with me and peter in the last two months
6979449 there is a good team of coaches to work with with the england set up there is every stone covered there is nothing that is left
6979450 sometimes there are too many ideas sometimes there is a chance to just let players go out there and play and learn from their experiences of playing
6979451 the one thing i like to see in a player is just to play the game work it out for themselves if they really do need help go and ask
6979452 you know from playing the game that the best coach in anybody is yourself
6979453 for five years i never had an xi on the pitch that i hadnt wanted
6979454 there have been times when weve picked squads of 16 for touring where id have had another player for other players but through my time ive always had the xi ive wanted and i believe that is exactly how it should be
6979455 i want to play in the ashes and i think realistically ive to try and get back in the next six or seven months if not the start of next summer
6979456 so games for yorkshire are crucial and hopefully go to india and force my way in the team
6979457 if not the caribbean they are two teams ive had a lot of success against
6979458 and then early next summer sri lanka if they come and then the big ashes series
6979459 i honestly dont care i want to get in the team
6979460 when i came back to rome from spain and gaul once i had successfully closed the enterprises in these provinces the senate decided that for my return the
6979461 it is too early to say because it is not possible at the end of last year phelps won
6979462 senator joseph r biden jr of delaware will become senator

6979470 that he had no problem with george however he felt differently about georges agent mark bartelstein
6979471 devean george did everything right devean george was very clear that he was going to defer to his agent his agent was basically going to make the decision for him devean is fine his agent thats a whole other story i dont understand the agent and his logic if there is any behind the decision but its not devean george
6979472 some people are born into this world who are just superstars and the ability he has with that cricket ball when he bowls is just second to none its absolutely phenomenal
6979473 he can bowl in practice with one arm and still hit a length and im fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can ask to knock the stumps over at the death and he bowls those kind of deliveries at the death hes brilliant
6979474 this is the stage he belongs on not playing for durham in front of 34 people he should be playing in front of 34 000 40 000 or 50 000 thats where steve harmison belongs
6979475 steve wants to play for england he wants to play on the biggest stage which is where hes performing on at the moment
6979476 theres some really positive stuff happening in english cricket at the moment but theres no point getting ahead of ourselves because we start every series well
6979477 we always win the first game and then mess the next four up the key to this victory is to make sure we focus on tuesday and we turn up on tuesday with the same energy the same buzz and the same confidence
6979478 i dont think the guys being up for it was a problem we just lacked a little bit of skill and we were outplayed in a lot of departments
6979479 we kept our side in the game with the energy and intensity but our skill levels werent quite where they needed to be and they have been over the last two years

6979487 were as deep as weve ever been and healthier than the last couple of years
6979488 not the main factor but a factor no excuses on our end but a factor in 2006 and last year whatever happened in the past we have learned a lot from it
6979489 it was her first game on the road against no 4 ranked ucla and on fox television
6979490 people say we lost four starters but i look at production of those four starters
6979491 can we replace or get better production out of our front four that is what we aim to do
6979492 a lot of people are doubting us because we are young we are going to surprise you
6979493 he has work from our x and z receiver positions we have run him into the ground
6979494 he has probably been one of our most consistent receivers in camp
6979495 he has had kind of a quiet camp to see him make some plays out there lately was good
6979496 i think we have maybe one or two people who can do that
6979497 a lot of it depends on staying healthy and what we are doing
6979498 it is probably good for me because i can make rational decisions without getting too emotional
6979499 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6979500 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6979501 you cant explain the feeling you feel after the greatest olympics ever
6979502 he pitches quite a few games like that where we dont score a whole lot of runs seems like theyre always close games
6979503 because of the way they defend the fact they are a really close knit team and that they had basically three years to get ready for this i think i would tend to go with this current team
6979504 the thing that is impressive is that theyre playing well together
6979505 defensively and with the quickness and athleticism of our players its not easy for foreign teams to deal with
6979506 the thing that is amazing as i look back at that experience and look at the gold medal in my office
6979507 is that this gold medal is the only one that was ever won by collegians
6979508 when recruits come in they have a chance to see that gold medal and hear the story behind it
6979509 its really a source of pride for anyone on that team or anyone on that coaching staff at the time it didnt seem like that big of a deal but as its gone on why its a tremendous accomplishment
6979510 we told muggsy to put his nose in petrovics navel because we knew from scouting him that he never took a shot without putting the ball on the floor first we held him to one basket in the first half on someone elses steal
6979511 to start the second half petrovic dribbled the ball over muggsys head and then tried to catch up to it
6979512 i think other than the dream team it sort of became a social gathering for the pros and the guys were spending more time playing golf and other things than preparing for the team
6979513 it seems now that the attitude of the current olympic team is that these guys are really excited about representing the united states and im happy to see that
6979514 its also nice to see the guys on that team have been active in going to watch other events for a while the team was kept isolated from anything other than their sport so theyre making this into the event it should be

6979516 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue
6979517 we are going to do everything we can to create a situation where merriman is not in pain and the leg gets some strength back
6979518 what i did was on my landing leg im not landing as stiff
6979519 im being more aggressive attacking the zone and feeling comfortable and confident
6979520 he goes out there and does what he did the last couple of nights
6979521 im starting to get the footwork back and turning double plays
6979522 its kind of like riding a bike it comes back to you
6979523 im easy whatever they tell me to do ill do it
6979524 but im sure im not taking ground balls to waste my time
6979525 we are grateful to fsn arizona for rearranging their programming for our fans for such an important matchup
6979526 my first thought was wow im going to the world series hartje said
6979527 its a dream come true i was shocked i couldnt believe it
6979528 i just asked how can we get there and they said pay your way fields said
6979529 theyre going to look good when they get there fields said
6979530 gosh the kids are so excited tucson coach richard ferber said
6979531 my son justin has already put on his clothes once this is a big time dream
6979532 the field was even more spectacular than we ever imagined
6979533 maverick frank who was hitting sharp line drives and hard ground balls in preparation
6979534 its a great experience for them i get out of it the same things every little leaguer gets out of it its just fun
6979535 i think were a pretty good team said hartje a huge sports fan
6979536 we have maverick nick meyerowitz and philip glembin all are good players
6979537 whenever your team wins thats even bigger and if you have the game winning run man i know i can score i run fast when i get my feet pumping im fast
6979538 when you watch you cant help but appreciate what these children have to struggle with and overcome and do it to play said scott rosenberg of little league baseball
6979539 it kind of lifts your spirit and puts into perspective your situation makes you appreciate your circumstances
6979540 he was moving people around and moving the ball against the zone he played his best game that third quarter was critical for the win and jason was the primary guy in making that happen
6979541 thats why were in the gold medal game and hopefully that will give us the best chance of beating spain if we get back to playing defense like that for a full 40 minutes
6979542 they have to play ugly if you try to play showtime throw the ball up alley oop youre going to get it you have to make the u s uncomfortable
6979543 right now there is no celebrating because we havent accomplished anything
6979544 the kids knew it was going to happen but its still unbelievable when you go up there and they are walking out with these bags
6979545 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
6979546 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
6979547 if i were still the boss there id pick bob costas
6979548 i truly appreciate als comments but nbc has many qualified journalists with more extensive news backgrounds than my own so i think ill keep my night job
6979549 bob costas or bryant gumbel both are smart quick and do their homework either would excel but its not my call or als
6979550 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6979551 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
6979552 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6979553 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
6979554 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake
6979555 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
6979556 thats as bad of a points night as we could have
6979557 we just have to keep our heads up we know were good enough to go win this championship still
6979558 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
6979559 this season weve really risen toward the top and we compete week in and week out with the best in the series
6979560 its the first thing i told the guys great team to play in the preseason
6979561 theyll let you know where youre at they will find a way to get eight guys in the box any time they can
6979562 anytime you play a team like that its the one on one battles that you have to win and as a quarterback you have to find the one on one battles and the matchups
6979563 hes a sponge everything hes absorbing hes asking questions what else tell me more remind me of this
6979564 and the biggest thing is what he takes from the meeting room when he actually sees it he gets excited about it hes like thats it right there i see it every day hes learning
6979565 omar may be the best ball player we have on this team
6979566 hes a sophomore hes young but he has limitless potential
6979567 but hes not even close to where he can be
6979568 i dont think he is now but he has a chance to be he has a lot of physical skills and he has a great attitude its just a matter of playing as far as im concerned
6979569 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6979570 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6979571 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6979572 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6979573 i probably hit it better than i did thursday but nothing went in
6979574 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6979575 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6979576 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks

6979588 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
6979589 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich

6979592 although the indians can fill the dam between june 21 and aug 31 they can only do so by releasing at least 55 000 cusecs downstream we made a call to the indian indus basin water treaty commissioner who promised to get back after checking the facts from irrigation authorities in occupied kashmir
6979593 but it certainly was a violation of the indus basin water treaty as pakistan had always feared when the indians were building the dam
6979594 inflow in the chenab river has gone down to 20 000 cusecs on friday against its historic low of 35 000 cusecs
6979595 il ministro della difesa russo anatoly serdyukov ha riferito al comandante dellesercito il presidente dmitry medvedev di aver completato il ritiro dal territorio georgiano dei militari russi inviati a rafforzare i peacekeeper
6979596 il ritiro stato portato avanti senza alcun incidente ed stato completato come nei piani alle 19
6979597 da quanto ci risulta non hanno effettuato un ritiro completo dalle aree considerate fuori dal territorio di conflitto e devono farlo
6979598 c stato qualche movimento di forze ma difficile determinare se si tratti di un ritiro o di un semplice ri posizionamento di uomini in ogni caso si tratta di movimenti di scarsa portata

6979601 we are getting into a post antibiotic era with no new ammunition theres not going to be one magic bullet out there however doing something like this we are not speeding the process of antibiotic resistance too much
6979602 youre not wiping the other ones out youre having a softer evolutionary pressure against resistance
6979603 if were lucky and we have a breakthrough thatd be great id rather be conservative

6979616 counting all the wins we couldnt pull out for him earlier in the season he would have been up there with webb 18 19 wins hes doing a great job i hope he stays the same
6979617 i never had many strikeouts in a season the closest i came was in college my junior year when i had 199 pitching coach dave righetti came up and gave me the ball and congratulated me that was pretty nice to hear
6979618 he reminded me of pedro feliz a little bit because of the arm its that good
6979619 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6979620 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6979621 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6979622 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6979623 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6979624 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6979625 the fed needs to raise interest rates now slowly and predictably to restore confidence in its continued commitment to price stability
6979626 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6979627 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979628 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6979629 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6979630 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6979631 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6979632 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6979633 these have been an absolutely fantastic games and theres no doubt that in terms of performance and theatre the chinese have set the bar pretty high
6979634 but i think with british ingenuity wit and all the rest of it resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6979635 i am absolutely determined that we come in under the 9 3 billion i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6979636 we are looking at ways of economising finding ways of moving things around perhaps but in no way do i want to prejudice the legacy value of the olympics
6979637 ensure that londons taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
6979638 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6979643 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6979644 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6979645 with which he needs to work closely on the war on terror in order to keep washington in the right humor
6979646 the logic will be that a powerful individual with national support which zardari might get will be more effective to deal with the question of terrorism
6979647 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6979648 hyper girl that one short words long sentences dont think she has any idea how to hold still can never really tell if she understands what im talking about or not doesnt matter though shes too noisy for my workroom and the mess she made when my idiot brother tangled with not messing with that even my lifes too short to deal with the kind of chaos shes likely to create on a bad day
6979649 shed pass for normal if you didnt know what to look for doesnt usually have the fangs out isnt as pale as the rest of her kind just this sweet innocent kid who can probably tear you apart with her bare hands if you tick her off and beats up whichever side started the fight when she cant tell whos in the right
6979650 ah the kid with the streaky hair seen her around the camp a few times first time shed had a bellyful of rock candy and couldnt hold still but there was the one time when she was hanging over the game tables pointing out possible maneuvers with one hand snarfing up popcorn with the other and chatting incessantly knew what she was talking about we were surprised but we probably shouldntve been she sounds oblivious but theres something about where she places herself few scuffles ive seen her in shes always been exactly where she needs to be or made where she was into where she needed to be odd girl
6979651 big loud but fun cold and warm at the same time and smells like earth knows where to scratch but squeezes too much and too hard should really start keeping raisins in her pocket good for keeping people out of trouble though
6979652 conditions in the system would approach the intolerable and drastic action to relieve the position would be inescapable

6979656 although that is the most overrated aspect of american politics
6979657 its important that we win in november and i think john mccain gives us the best chance to win in november
6979658 from facebook to blogging to twitter it seems that social media is everywhere as is the pressure to participate in this burgeoning

6979671 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
6979672 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
6979673 i go in once a day and pray for him
6979674 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
6979675 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him
6979676 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6979677 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6979678 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6979679 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6979680 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6979681 what i heard was that parents didnt feel it was safe and we just felt it wouldnt be wise to proceed without giving them more input
6979682 theres not enough data in my opinion about whether it could cause health problems or not
6979683 money is a big thing in education especially right now with the jobs and programs theyve had to cut
6979684 but the safety of our children has to come first
6979685 i just didnt want it to go up because i was afraid it could cause cancer
6979686 people do have concerns about medical issues but there hasnt been any evidence or conclusive facts that show cell phone towers have any impact

6979688 given the fact that our census is so low were not able to attract the physicians and specialists we need to keep the unit
6979689 the inconvenience will be to those with mild and moderate burns who could have been treated down there
6979690 any injury can be minor to severe but burns are problematic because the whole body is open to infection losing fluid and theyre very painful
6979691 there is the need to have these big burn centers with the expertise
6979692 we wanted to try to facili tate a county library
6979693 this was a dangerous situation no matter when it happened
6979694 its important that we determine the cause of the fire so that we can prevent it from happening again
6979695 the mandatory measures are not intended to be overly restrictive

6979712 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6979713 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
6979714 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves

6979719 i will ensure that any matters arising are duly acted upon by my department and where relevant are passed on for states and territories to implement
6979720 the department advises me that theyve done a very thorough investigation into those 23 cases from india and that there is currently only one case that they are continuing to investigate
6979721 i have since also asked for another in depth audit of all of those 23 cases involved
6979722 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6979723 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6979724 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6979725 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing

6979729 in truth most of our time is going to be spent in iowa then nevada then new hampshire sort of in that order
6979730 the caucus is such an unusual process that in relative terms a relatively few number of people will determine the winner out there so nevada needs a little more hands on involvement
6979731 if i come in first second if im one of the top three i think im in good shape
6979732 now if i come in a distant fourth im out of this as i would argue anybody else is theres only three people basically coming out of iowa and heading to new hampshire
6979733 its so frustrating to keep hearing oh yeah biden would be the best candidate and the best president but i dont think he can win the primary
6979734 hes considered to have one of the strongest plans on ending the iraq war which he has stressed on the stump in iowa
6979735 rather than simply focusing on troop withdrawal bidens plan outlines a proposed political settlement that would divide iraq into three religious or ethnic regions with a loose federal government

6979805 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6979806 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6979807 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6979808 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6979809 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6979810 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6979811 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6979812 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6979813 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6979814 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6979815 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6979816 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6979817 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6979818 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6979819 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6979820 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6979821 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6979822 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6979823 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6979824 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6979825 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6979826 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6979827 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6979828 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6979829 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6979830 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6979831 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6979832 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6979833 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6979834 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6979835 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6979836 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6979837 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6979838 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6979839 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6979840 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6979841 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6979842 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6979843 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6979844 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6979845 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6979846 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6979847 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6979848 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6979849 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6979850 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6979851 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6979852 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6979853 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6979854 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6979855 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6979856 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6979857 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6979858 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6979859 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6979860 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6979861 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6979862 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6979863 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6979864 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6979865 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6979866 who are open to doing something on the production side
6979867 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6979868 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6979869 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6979870 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6979871 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6979872 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6979873 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6979874 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6979875 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6979876 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6979877 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6979878 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6979879 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6979880 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6979881 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6979882 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6979883 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6979884 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6979888 excellent presentation of how to turn the dancefloor fron hell to heaven simple but revolutionary information
6979889 fantastic presentation lot of great moment and insights demonstrations were great
6979890 what a presentation you never cease to amaze me you are a natural and one of the funniest speakers i ever seen
6979891 i liked the message at the end that there is always a way

6979894 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6979895 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6979896 the economy could hardly have remained immune from such severe financial disruptions
6979897 the process is not always as nimble as we might like
6979898 im willing to take a chance on him im willing to give him the benefit of the doubt
6979899 more time should be given to guarantee that all the bidders can provide the air force with the best options possible
6979900 given the delays already caused by the air forces own flawed selection process the request for additional time to prepare a proposal based on a different aircraft is entirely reasonable and it should be granted
6979901 these planes will be in the fleet for 40 to 60 years and its more important to make the right decision
6979902 this is a 40 billion contract to design and build the backbone of our nations military might and the requirements have changed overnight
6979903 providing only 60 days for a major design overhaul not only skews the competition toward airbus but also breaks the promise of a fair competition for our military and taxpayers
6979904 credit is the lubricant that keeps the global economys engine working as the capital markets tighten and restrict the flow of capital the global economy slows
6979905 they want to bring in suppliers to do virtually any job here
6979906 we are going to be negotiating until we drop the final offer
6979907 they want to divide us from anyone hired after 2009

6979910 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6979911 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6979912 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6979913 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
6979914 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6979915 if youve heard of gears or browserplus chances are youve heard them positioned as competitors in one way or another another google vs yahoo showdown truth is thats not the case at all or at least doesnt have to be after taking a look at what these technologies actually offer we can see that theyre actually two distinct approaches to an exciting new direction for the web
6979916 i resent our so called leaders giving tax breaks to whoever they please
6979917 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
6979918 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off
6979919 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6979920 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6979921 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6979922 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
6979923 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
6979924 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
6979925 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
6979926 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
6979927 if there is nothing to be afraid of let their kids be x rayed
6979928 a caucasian girl is going to fuse her knee centers at about age 15 theyre going to fuse their iliac crest at about age 16 and part of the elbow will start fusing around 13 or 14
6979929 of course everybody who gets arrested says they are 17
6979930 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
6979931 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979932 he hasnt demonstrated it yet this is early in the campaign
6979933 probably the most under qualified person since george bush to seek the presidency
6979934 our study is the first showing the capability of self recognition must have emerged independently at least two times
6979935 bastion of bigotry against men that has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program
6979936 the courses pretty much treat guys as if theyre sources of evil in the world and the women are victims
6979937 im using the same argument here as we have with title ix when a university receives government funding they have to provide equal opportunities for men and women if theres no mens studies womens studies is unconstitutional
6979938 if roy den hollander really understood what mens studies was
6979939 but whenever you make a charge that youre favoring one group over the other they either have to make it equal or eliminate the first one id like to see every womens studies program throughout the country eliminated
6979940 its a belief system and like all religions its an irrational one
6979941 a feminist is someone who was born as a female and because of that believes theyre superior to men and that females are innocent until proven guilty and that guys are primarily always at fault
6979942 mochten gerard rene en ik gaan dan met een hysterische act het is tijd voor een nieuwe aanpak de rellen die we dan verzinnen en de puinhoop die we cre ren nog voordat het festival is begonnen heerlijk
6979943 ik weet niet of het verstandig is gezien mijn leeftijd en werkschema is het niet heel leuk om nick amp simon of thomas berge te sturen als de toppers zouden meedoen zou het voor de gein en voor de act zijn dus nee ik zeg niet gillend ja
6979944 en toen stuurden ze hind een heel lief meisje hoor maar het liedje was natuurlijk nietszeggend anouk zou ik een nige inzending vinden zij is een fantastische zangeres die live goed dingen kan doen maar ik heb gehoord dat zij zich niet aan allerlei regels wil houden
6979945 we are hoping it will serve as an example in the construction industry
6979946 some features were not very practical we have learnt from the past
6979947 it is important for us to show that it is possible to construct buildings which are environmentally friendly at a reasonable price
6979948 in doing all we can to reach both the minergie and leed building standards we hope to share knowledge and experience and influence others to do the same
6979949 gt this model its drawn by hand because i still have no program to do this with my computer

6979951 their model for a clean air truck program at liberty quarry is exactly the type of proactive action that companies should be emulating to help reduce local and regional air emissions and is a model for where we should be going
6979952 granite construction has a proud history of leadership when it comes to supporting new technology for environmental improvement
6979953 in the case of liberty quarry we have the opportunity to incorporate new technology on day one of the project in order to accelerate clean air efforts in the region we believe it is the right thing to do
6979954 we appreciate the ongoing cooperation and collaboration of aqmd and carb staff in the creation of this program as well as their pledge to assist with the necessary technology to insure its implementation and monitoring
6979955 this program is yet another local benefit provided by liberty quarry and demonstrates the positive regional impact of a local aggregate source it further addresses any health concerns related to air quality
6979956 the owner chose to go ahead with changing the waterproofing system and having it incorporated into the concrete using hycrete a hydrophobic concrete admixture from hycrete inc since it was a significant cost savings and a time saving method
6979957 hydrophobic waterproofing has been used extensively in the seattle area for years
6979958 the key here at tarzana as far as for the owner from our perspective is the time savings
6979959 but with hycrete were providing both corrosion proofing and waterproofing in one application
6979960 once you pour the concrete the waterproofing is done at the same time
6979961 with the hydrophobic system if there is a leak it is going to be localized
6979962 because of this difference we are able to offer a performance based warranty
6979963 which means if there is a leak we will come and fix it for you
6979964 we have decided to cease any outdoor storage of clinker at our crestmore plant
6979965 we are currently in the process of implementing plant modifications to achieve this goal
6979966 joes a good guy we all criticize each other during this time but for joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
6979967 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6979968 god if you love me why must i endure pain
6979969 our intention was not to just build a box but to build a facility designed especially for our children
6979970 we had already poured foundations when we learned the anchor center had received the grant so the concrete and aggregate we received were used for site concrete

6979990 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
6979991 its the worst thing that could happen having to stop at the olympics
6979992 ive never stopped any race since i began even when i fell or broke something i always finish
6979993 here it was a physical problem i couldnt do anything else
6979994 when i got back on my bike my pulse and my breathing just went very high
6979995 even if i slowed down i was unable to feel better i stopped one time completely but it didnt work i stopped again and then i had to stop
6979996 it gives me confidence i can be top three in the world to come in and do it at the olympics when everyone else is trying to be top three is pretty spectacular
6979997 i made the decision that whatever happened i wasnt going to feel like i lost third i won fourth its an awesome result
