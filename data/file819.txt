8190021 claro que existem certas analogias que est o em estudo especialmente desde que a r ssia advertiu que a proclama o unilateral da independ ncia do kosovo e o reconhecimento dessa independ ncia seria um precedente infelizmente n o queriam nos ouvir
8190022 este n o foi um conflito que escolhemos n o temos interesse no territ rio georgiano
8190023 ele acreditava que a r ssia ficaria parada enquanto suas tropas
8190024 nossas tropas entraram na ge rgia para destruir bases usadas para o ataque e depois deixaram o pa s restabelecemos a paz mas n o conseguimos acalmar os temores e aspira es dos moradores da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia
8190025 poss vel imaginar o que foi para os abkhazes ver fechada sua universidade de sujumi pelo governo de tbilisi sob o argumento de que supostamente n o tinham uma l ngua adequada ou uma hist ria ou cultura e por isso n o precisavam de uma universidade
8190026 argumentamos constantemente que seria imposs vel depois disto dizer oss tia do sul e abkh zia que o que era bom para os albano kosovares n o era bom para eles nas rela es internacionais n o se pode ter uma regra para uns e outra para outros
8190027 acredito que a sa de tem que funcionar como um sistema integrado a quest o da gest o t o importante quanto novos equipamentos hoje me voltaria muito para a gest o em um momento inicial e para a disputa de projetos que possamos apresentar ao minist rio da sa de garantindo a amplia o dos recursos e do teto do sus sistema nico de sa de para a nossa cidade
8190028 as pol ticas do minist rio da sa de de modo geral respondem necessidade da cidade mas a atual gest o n o enviou ao minist rio os projetos para que porto alegre pudesse receber recursos que outras cidades receberam perdemos recursos para o nosso hospital de pronto socorro mantemos uma baixa cobertura na equipe de sa de da fam lia e vamos aumentar isso como nossa meta
8190029 a sa de vive uma dificuldade muito grande na nossa cidade pela perda de recursos que deixaram de ser acessados no minist rio na medida em que o atual prefeito n o enviou os projetos e pela necessidade portanto de mais investimentos municipais e uma gest o mais qualificada o que eu quero dizer que a popula o merece um atendimento melhor e vou trabalhar para isso
8190030 porque as crian as contam com uma rede muito pequena sua disposi o para conseguir acessar a educa o infantil as creches de modo geral porto alegre uma cidade que foi pioneira na estrutura o de uma rede de creches conveniadas da comunidade fiz a emenda que incorporou essas creches com a possibilidade de financiamento do fundeb fundo de manuten o e desenvolvimento da educa o b sica agora falta aqui e provavelmente em outras cidades tamb m fazer com que essas crian as sejam contadas para saber quantas s o as que necessitam de apoio para que tanto o munic pio quanto o governo federal disponibilizem recursos para essas creches comunit rias
8190031 porto alegre poderia estar melhor em termos de qualidade de educa o n o apenas na educa o p blica h investimentos importantes na educa o privada mas o mais importante mesmo que a educa o p blica responda s necessidades de uma gera o e a educa o por onde a gente poder dar a essa nossa juventude um futuro melhor
8190032 perdemos na nossa cidade cerca de 25 dos passageiros de transporte coletivo no ltimo per odo queremos portanto que o transporte coletivo retome qualidade para que possa atender a popula o e com isso enfrentaremos tamb m os engarrafamentos que j est o presentes em v rios hor rios do dia em todos os bairros da cidade

8190042 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8190043 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8190044 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8190045 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8190046 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8190047 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8190048 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8190049 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8190051 in the first six months of 2008 we reported healthy growth in revenue and profitability despite a weakening global economy
8190052 with a slowing global economy high commodity prices and policies by the chinese government towards the export manufacturing sector we are beginning to feel the impact on our customers businesses as well as on our own
8190053 despite the impact the current climate is having on gold supplier members in our international marketplace our china marketplace grew very quickly in the first half of 2008 this growth is a result of efforts taken over the past few years to expand the network effect of our marketplace and maintain high customer satisfaction levels which are bearing fruit in the face of a strong domestic economy going forward we expect the robust growth of our china marketplace to continue the recent launches of a series of new products and services including winport china trustpass for individuals and export to china will further expand our china marketplace and we are encouraged by the positive response these initiatives have received so far

8190086 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out

8190105 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8190106 they have the human resources which is the most important
8190107 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8190108 north korea is biding its time thinking there is no rush for denuclearisation
8190109 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues

8190134 this debate we have about the vice president and what he brings to the table is really just cocktail party conversation for washington d c
8190135 he has a passion for foreign policy and by choosing him barack obama clearly wants his perspective at the table but this pick will have very little bearing on average voters
8190136 this was not a pick to go to the moderate center and thats instructive
8190137 it was a pick to stay on the far left of the democratic party he biden has a record of being a staunch opponent of contra aid in the 1980s and also a critic of missile defense
8190138 if barack obama gets a gold medal in liberalism then joe biden gets a bronze
8190139 as president i would say to nicaraguan leader daniel ortega if you attempt to change the geopolitical balance that is move troops across the border or set up a soviet or cuban base well come down on you like a ton of bricks and i wouldnt define what that means
8190140 id tell him that the contras are his problem were out of there
8190141 this immaculately conceived notion has obviously demonstrated a certain mystical appeal unfortunately it has no possibility of practical implementation
8190142 it has confused our national debate increased and misallocated our defense budget diverted valuable research and development resources weakened the atlantic alliance by raising doubts about americas commitment to the collective defense and pushed soviet behavior the wrong way the presidents continued adherence to it constitutes one of the most reckless and irresponsible acts in the history of modern statecraft
8190143 a national missile defense could well cost hundreds of billions of dollars and have only limited effectiveness
8190144 at the time it seemed among our only remaining hopes i thought biden performed a service in proposing it and fleshing it out even if it turned out not to be necessary at least not in the form originally expected
8190145 so id be careful about drawing conclusions for the future from his federalism proposal of the past
8190146 this is pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
8190147 the urgency to act has never been greater especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
8190148 poverty has fallen by about 1 per year since 1981
8190149 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts
8190150 our membership in hp dspp provides our enterprise customers with the flexibility to control their endpoints in support of secure business operations even when they leave the protected walls of the corporate network said sean martin cissp skyrecon vp of marketing together with hps comprehensive set of client management offerings stormshield security suite ensures that it operations and security operations can work hand in hand to define deploy and enforce the appropriate risk based and business enabling endpoint policies necessary to meet their internal external and regulatory compliance requirements

8190156 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8190157 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the
8190158 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8190159 if this election is going to be as close as the polls indicate
8190160 the biggest and best rock show the world has ever witnessed
8190161 obviously on any creative plans well want general agreement from stakeholders and everything will be signed off by locog
8190162 if my dome experience is anything to go by its not that interesting creative sophisticated ideas were ignored they were actually energetically rejected
8190163 unable to distinguish between volume of activity and quality of activity
8190164 instead of having world class art world class architecture you got installations some of which looked as if they were designed by people whose last job had been to make a stand for british gas at a trades fair in antwerp
8190165 a mixed bag but on the whole the best of the hand over shows i can remember interesting and a little quirky
8190166 london needs to do something that is just smart alecky enough but you dont want to push it so far that it becomes disrespectful to the athletes or the olympic tradition
8190167 a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8190168 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8190169 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8190170 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats
8190171 and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8190172 john mccain promises more of the past america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8190173 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8190174 certainly the kind of activity that i was told about before was something that i approved of that is the community getting out there and helping people to know what the contact numbers are to report information to the police so that we can act on it and take positive action
8190175 but challenging people on their doorsteps is not acceptable and is not something that greater manchester police approves of
8190176 i just wish the police did more drug dealers are still operating in this area
8190177 in order to have the streets clean for our kids then we as parents need to do something about it
8190178 we go on every street every main road and every corner looking out for dealers and prostitutes
8190179 there is no violence but we will explain to them that we will not tolerate them killing our innocent brothers and sisters
8190180 clinton had said nothing about obamas ability to be the commander in chief and i have to think the omission was conscious
8190181 wo die beh rden waren wo die nachbarn wo die polizei
8190182 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8190183 users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety
8190184 lead a determined attack on need by strengthening and expanding the role of faith based and community organizations fbcos in providing social services
8190185 the paramount goal is compassionate results and private and charitable groups including religious ones should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field
8190186 the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no god damn america thats in the bible for killing innocent people god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human god damn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
8190187 we must be honest enough to expose white entitlement and supremacy wherever it raises its head
8190188 when hillary was crying and people said it was put on i really dont believe it was put on
8190189 i really believe she just always thought this is mine
8190190 every house of worship that wants to run an effective program and thats willing to abide by our constitution from the largest mega churches and synagogues to the smallest store front churches and mosques can and will have access to the information and support they need to run that program
8190191 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
8190192 one of the key activities of these offices is to provide training and resources to faith based organizations to ensure that they are adhering to church state guidelines under the constitution
8190193 its not a partisan strategy it is an effective governing strategy
8190194 make no mistake as someone who used to teach constitutional law i believe deeply in the separation of church and state but i dont believe this partnership will endanger that idea

8190221 hay insuficiente evidencia de que hubiera alg n tipo de plan o amenaza pero nos mantendremos abiertos al investigar
8190222 la evidencia es insuficiente para representar en este momento una real amenaza complot o conspiraci n contra el senador obama

8190224 i think that to get good information you need a little contention
8190225 they see how nice the town looks and they want to lock the door and not let anyone else in
8190226 the board will be objective in meeting the needs of both the old and new residents as this town belongs to everyone that calls ancram their home
8190227 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8190228 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges
8190229 were going as quickly as we can and the town is not facing emergency services being cut or anything like that
8190230 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8190231 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8190232 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8190233 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8190241 its equally important that people can understand what they are signing
8190242 know who their audience is and they should write for them
8190243 we got your second hand books with half the pages torn out
8190244 you got 1 500 words on a form that could be said in 500
8190245 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8190246 overall there has been a very significant drop in the incidence of extra judicial killings by much as 70 percent from 2007 2008 compared to the 2005 2006 period
8190247 were also concerned about the resurgence of killings by this death squad because weve been investigating 10 new cases over the last few months
8190248 who knows we might come across some of the disappeared when we do suprise and unannounced visits

8190254 will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8190255 weve been very clear with north korea that there will be action for action
8190256 and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8190257 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8190258 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8190259 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8190260 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8190261 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8190262 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8190263 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8190264 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8190265 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8190266 tiene adsl en su casa y a n no est ganando din ero a trav s de internet
8190267 series stacking marks a key development in our strategy to let audiences view our programmes whenever and wherever they want
8190268 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8190269 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8190270 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8190271 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8190272 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8190273 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8190274 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8190275 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8190276 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8190277 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8190278 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8190279 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8190280 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8190281 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8190282 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later
8190283 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8190284 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8190285 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8190286 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8190287 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8190288 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8190289 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8190331 once someone moves into a building its very difficult to get them out
8190332 the court will be sympathetic but as far as the law is concerned the yakuza are citizens with the same rights as other tenants
8190333 the dojinkai are a particularly vicious group certainly not as polished as others that prefer to stay out of the limelight they may decide to move out to avoid any more bad publicity but where would they go then
8190334 when you look at the numbers its easy to see how influential they are

8190353 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
8190354 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
8190355 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
8190356 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
8190357 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years

8190476 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order

8190513 it was so disappointing to lose on monday because we had fought back into a winning position after being ten points behind despite having to contend with bike problems and another injury
8190514 but we missed a big opportunity to put space between ourselves and the bottom of the table the hard truth of the matter now is that we have got to win our last three home matches and even then it might not be enough to keep us out of the play off it is out of our hands now
8190515 losing at wolverhampton on monday was a blow because not for the first time this season we were so close to an away win

8190536 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant

8190539 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8190540 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8190541 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8190551 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories

8190643 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8190644 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8190675 zaman telah berubah dan kita sebagai terajunya kena mainkan peranan memajukan lagi parti kerana rakyat sudah yakin dengan pakatan rakyat
8190676 bagi saya apa yang rakyat tunjukkan umpama lampu hijau bahawa era perdana menteri dato seri abdullah ahmad badawi di penghujung hayat
8190677 di permatang pauh bn asyik bersumpah dan najib juga sering saja bersumpah ketika berkempen dan akibatnya mereka kalah teruk
8190678 abdullah minta rakyat tolak budaya politik fitnah tetapi beliau sendiri tidak menunjukkan kesungguhan untuk membanteras amalan kotor yang dibawakan oleh jentera kempen bn yang diketuai oleh najib
8190679 lebih penting lagi kemenangan anwar membuktikan harapan rakyat untuk melihat perubahan landskap politik di negara ini
8190680 abdullah dan najib sudah sewajarnya meletakan jawatan kerana keduanya telah terbukti gagal
8190681 langkah pertama mereka dengan segala fitnah terhadap anwar sudah gagal dan kita lihat mereka sedang berusaha untuk menggunakan langkah kedua bagi menghalang anwar dari memasuki parlimen
8190682 kita melihat ada kecenderungan ke arah itu dan kita juga bimbang jika anwar dinafikan haknya untuk mengangkat sumpah secepat mungkin
8190683 selaku speaker pandikar amin harus bertindak wajar agar beliau dilihat berwibawa dan tidak berat sebelah
8190684 rakyat telah memberikan pakatan rakyat amanah yang besar dan kita tidak boleh berbangga dengan kemenangan tersebut hingga lupa tanggungjawab kita yang masih belum tercapai
8190685 saya berharap agar urusan mengangkat sumpah bagi membolehkan anwar berada di parlimen dipermudahkan
8190686 he is a fighter people have underestimated him before no one expected him to make it this far
8190687 his passion to implement the things he believes in has been his driving force
8190688 initially it was very difficult because you are completely cut off it is like living in a dungeon
8190689 i read the quran i also drew a lot of inspiration from other civilizations cultures i read a lot of hindu epics and chinese philosophies of course christianity six years of 12 hours a day of reading thats quite a lot
8190690 i didnt know what was going to happen but i knew i would be vindicated it was a matter of conviction because i trusted the wisdom of the masses
8190691 its still uncertain it may be in september it may be later but i think the threat is certainly there
8190692 the election results contend that he truly is a prime minister in waiting hes a serious contender
8190693 people are so fed up with the old system and put their hope into this one person who has gone through a very dramatic experience
8190694 ive no doubt that hell become the next prime minister
8190695 and people who dabble in pirated software tend to be used to much worse than this and frankly anyone i know running a pirated version of xp is well aware of the fact and is ready to accept a bit of nagging about it

8190700 promotes activism and leadership among queer and allied youth and student organizations
8190701 and in the michigan caucus we were discussing that we really want to form a similar organization in michigan so that we can continue this dialogue all year long
8190702 i think the reason we have been growing so much is due in large part to the fact that students really want this organization
8190703 everyone talks about how we need to unite we need to come together we need to make these changes together and until this point the action behind those claims those words was limited now the people see that were really doing something
8190704 we do a lot of stuff at standout but we can do a lot more things if we network with other communities and other schools throughout the state
8190705 at this point we are a very new organization but were growing rapidly
8190706 our current offerings are limited but our goals are massive
8190707 by far the most pro equality platform in democratic history
8190708 makes very clear our party rejects discrimination including very explicitly discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
8190709 gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation
8190710 divisive effort to politicize the constitution by pursuing a federal marriage amendment
8190711 oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
8190712 it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave qualified
8190713 and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation
8190714 will fight to end discrimination based on race sexual orientation gender identity in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
8190715 children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and are more likely to commit crime drop out of school abuse drugs and end up in prison
8190716 whatever the word is its fully inclusive and delivers on that promise
8190717 but civil rights struggles are incremental and were moving the ball up the field here
8190718 ive been to afghanistan ive been to iraq seven times ive been in the balkans ive been in the foxholes with these kids literally in bunkers with them let me tell you something nobody asks anybody else whether theyre gay in those foxholes
8190719 weve got a war on our hands were trying to end and in the meantime were breaking the military nine thousand of these people have been kicked out this is not a rational policy
8190720 because it was the wrong direction and the wrong message
8190721 yesterday if you havent heard the california supreme court overturned a ban on gay marriage
8190722 so i would like to say right now for the first time i am announcing i am getting married im so excited if im this emotional now just saying it i cant imagine how thats gonna be but its something that ive of course weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and were just very very excited

8190725 this is a timely volume following as it does a recent flurry of reform proposals in the field of homicide its aim is to consider whether the ancient offence of manslaughter may be too blunt an instrument to address such a variety of killings as is highlighted in this volume or whether specific statutory offences offer a preferable solution the editors should be congratulated for bringing together commentators of such distinction of such breadth of opinion and approach the discussion ranges from the philosophical to the political to the doctrinal each chapter offers a challenging analysis of some aspect of the current law it should be read by anyone who is interested in the state of criminal homicide and in the prospects for reform
8190726 solo la fiction pu salvare dalla tremenda delusione di essere nati

8190732 chi si perde nella propria passione ha perduto meno di chi perde la propria passione
8190733 fare crepitare gli attimi di tuonare per coprire gli accordi del quotidiano
8190734 la nostra vita immaginaria avesse lo stesso peso se non maggiore della nostra vita reale
8190735 un sognatore che detesta il reale e apprezza solo la verit
8190736 siamo innanzi tutto un sistema innato di preferenze e rifiuti
8190737 luomo si senta attratto trascinato verso la donna che ancheggia davanti a lui
8190738 bere senza sete e amare in qualsiasi momento lunica cosa che distingue luomo dallanimale
8190739 se luomo argomenta ortega y gasset non possedesse unimmaginazione cos generosa non riuscirebbe ad amare sessualmente come invece fa ogni volta che se ne presenta loccasione
8190740 la maggior parte degli effetti che si attribuiscono allistinto non deriva da esso se cos fosse si manifesterebbero anche nellanimale per i nove decimi quanto viene attribuito alla sessualit opera del nostro magnifico potere di immaginazione che non un istinto ma il suo esatto contrario ossia una creazione
8190741 quando ci confrontiamo con una creatura della nostra specie ci si svela immediatamente la sua intima condizione
8190742 storia dei tipi femminili che man mano sono stati preferiti
8190743 qualche motivo di affinit che ci porti a supporre che quella donna e non unaltra
8190744 implica unintima adesione a un certo tipo di vita umana che ci sembra il migliore e che troviamo gi formato incarnato in un altro essere
8190745 lamore puro amore che non si realizza tutto tensione affanno anelito
8190746 il desiderio muore automaticamente quando si realizza finisce quando si appaga
8190747 come la letteratura chiosa jos ortega y gasset in entrambe il fattore pi importante limmaginazione
8190748 come un genere letterario che possiede origini leggi evoluzione e limiti propri

8190753 rusia tiene que reforzar la vigilancia de las fronteras a rea mar tima y terrestre de abjasia con georgia mediante el env o de asesores especialistas y equipos necesarios
8190754 en caso de necesidad ser a posible concertar acuerdos correspondientes con osetia del sur y abjasia

8190756 se oponen a la independencia y la autodeterminaci n de osetia del sur y abjasia a pesar de que han realizado una conquista militar de kosovo han reconocido su independencia y la garantizan mediante ocupaci n militar
8190757 el presidente george bush expres que se debe respetar la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia en referencia a que abjasia y osetia del sur no tienen derecho de separarse de georgia y proclamar su independencia pero cuando serbia exigi respetar su integridad territorial afirmando que el reconocimiento de la independencia de kosovo supon a una violaci n del derecho internacional se le dijo que el pueblo tiene derecho a la autodeterminaci n estados unidos y el consejo atl ntico acusaron a rusia del empleo desmedido de la fuerza pero la primavera de 1999 la otan bombarde a serbia durante 78 d as el verano de 2006 tras la incursi n de hezbollah en el territorio de israel este pa s lanz ataques contra el l bano durante 35 d as se podr a a adir que estos bombardeos desmedidos se realizaron tambi n porque ee uu no permiti que en aquel entonces el consejo de seguridad consensuara una resoluci n que exigiera de israel el cese de las hostilidades a juzgar por las palabras de bush por las declaraciones del secretario de defensa robert gates y por la presura con que el gobierno de ee uu celebr el acuerdo con polonia sobre la instalaci n de misiles interceptores en territorio polaco washington no sac conclusiones algunas de la crisis georgiana as las cosas hemos de estar preparados para nuevas crisis y nuevos errores

8190759 wow an intelligent and cohesive response from someone outside new york who knew
8190760 al contrario que bea lalola ha ca do bien desde el principio
8190761 im glad to see everybody im my chatroom if u wanna to talk about sex to discuss your wildest fantasies u are in correct place im here to give u the greatest pleasure i like when u are watching me playing with myself i like when u feel satisfied and cumming with me
8190762 over time i heard from the students who came to us for counseling and would say to me you know i want you to understand that you and the office saved my life i was suicidal and thanks to you i made the decision to live
8190763 even one and only one such report would have been immeasurably weighty humbling and gratifying
8190764 in about six months the office of student services gave us a small office and at our request as we wanted gender parity in the office hired two people a woman named cyndi gair and myself
8190765 we wanted our liberation which is what i told the regents when they invited me to come to one of their meetings and explain what we wanted
8190766 because at that time across the united states lesbian gay bisexual people were regarded as we know as sinful criminal and psychopathological
8190767 we naively said in 1971 were going to change this country and its going to happen like that
8190768 support for our concerns has slowly expanded over the years
8190769 they have far more self awareness and practical knowledge of these issues than college students in the 1970s
8190770 i cannot believe that it is not easier for lgbt college students today it is still a challenge however
8190771 it is not perfect by any means it is better
8190772 i now understand to some degree the connection among oppressions and hope that todays students are addressing that concern
8190773 i continue to learn that issues of gender identity gender expression and sexual orientation are inescapably linked to concerns of race ethnicity economic class and ability disability
8190774 i have come to some awareness of the depth of my sexism and racism and have attempted to address these feelings
8190775 being biracial and experiencing consequent harassment have fueled my racism i am still in my biracial closet
8190776 broadly put i would like to see disappear the sexism and the racism the homophobia the bi phobia and the trans phobia within our so called community itself
8190777 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8190778 the roll call at the republican lgbt caucus will be much shorter
8190779 for a president who believes in equal rights for all americans
8190780 will close the book on the old politics of race against race gender against gender group against group and straight against gay
8190781 i really dont think the glbt community is dog centric
8190782 i dont know about the human named leslie but i have certainly heard all i can stomach about the big yellow dog
8190783 im quite sure i will end up raising more money than the dog
8190784 i come from royalty you know the cat people will give but it takes them longer to get organized
8190785 he has been training for this walk by taking lots of naps
8190786 in this society it is always dog dog dog dog groomers doggie day care doggie treats dog parks
8190787 but i think there is a huge underground society of cat people out there and we quietly do our own thing without all the production and hype those folks will support the little cat
8190788 they should pledge me cause im cute soft and cuddly
8190789 and if they dont i will claw their couches dig holes in their gardens and eat their song birds
8190790 ryan was stabbed over 20 times his throat was slit his body was dumped on a dirt road
8190791 i think everyone can relate to the tragedy and how difficult it is to lose a loved one now imagine how we lost him
8190792 i think most americans would be shocked and appalled if they knew how often attacks like this happen
8190793 that changes the environment for passing such a bill in the congress
8190794 amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
8190795 proposition 8 eliminates right of same sex couples to marry initiative constitutional amendment
8190796 changes california constitution to eliminate right of same sex couples to marry provides that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california fiscal impact over the next few years potential revenue loss mainly sales taxes totaling in the several tens of millions of dollars to state and local governments in the long run likely little fiscal impact to state and local governments

8190804 we had to practise for a play and she did one on the grass
8190805 two teachers took her upstairs and she had to sit down for the rest of the day and not do anything
8190806 i said to the principal what if she keeps doing a handstand and he said shed get into trouble
8190807 i asked what would happen if she was a repeat handstand offender
8190808 ich gehe davon aus dass die rzte und auch die krankenkassen an einer l sung interessiert sind
8190809 well in business theres an old saying he who has all the gold makes all the rules
8190810 he who has all the gold makes all the rules
8190811 at the millennium march on washington in 2000 congresswoman tammy baldwin told hundreds of thousands of lgbt people gathered on the national mall if you dream of a world in which there are more openly gay elected officials then run for office
8190812 i thought of that quote this evening when i learned that rep baldwin and rep barney frank d mass will be joined by another openly gay colleague in the united states house of representatives
8190813 it sends an unmistakable signal that voters are willing to consider gay people as leaders at the highest level of government and brings us closer to the american ideal of a truly representative government
8190814 i always worried that that would get in the way of giving back and contributing to our society

8190828 china is putting 1 3 billion people through an industrial revolution with neither colonies nor substantial indigenous resources besides coal the only way it can do this is by establishing long term supply contracts with resource rich countries

8190830 as far as i know china no longer releases foreign direct investment to africa country by country
8190831 chinas demand for resources has driven up prices propelling signi cant gdp gains in many countries china has educated thousands of african university students and it sends africa hundreds of doctors and advisors each year chinese rms are building roads rehabilitating infrastructure and bringing cellphone service to places that land lines never reached
8190832 chinese rms are a little less ethically constrained than their western counterparts
8190833 other developing countries struggling to grow and reduce poverty are naturally interested in what has been the source of this impressive growth and what if any lessons other developing countries can take from china
8190834 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8190835 union a union between man and woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage
8190836 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
8190837 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8190838 for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix
8190839 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
8190840 im a federalist i believe that the state should make those decisions
8190841 that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
8190842 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition
8190843 the reason people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment is some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that for gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for a state to say you know what thats alright i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage is i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or different view

8190883 they had to take him to the hospital for stitches
8190884 i went to ask if i could take photos and i didnt have to introduce myself
8190885 youre shawn johnson he said which kind of freaked me out
8190886 i gave my heart and my soul out there i couldnt have asked for more
8190887 on the one hand youve got increased demand for a lot of these basic products and on the other hand from the supply side youve got a shortage of supply due to a bad crop of various products due to certain weather conditions and its the combination of the demand reasons and the supply reasons which has caused the increase in the price of basic products a double whammy effectively
8190888 he gave me some additional non public information that was enough for me to deny the permit
8190889 but he did have some hard feelings against some people at the university so its not difficult to make that leap to say he did have a vendetta
8190890 thats more fair more uniform and more like other states
8190891 i dont like the fact that we have 99 separate interpretations of whether a permit should be issued
8190892 the loss of professor millers life is very sad news no one would have wished for such a tragic end to this difficult situation
8190893 they chased shawn to the car and were all around her the way you see on tv
8190894 were you in it for me or were you in it
8190895 to my sisterhood in the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart you never gave in and you never gave up together we made history
8190896 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8190897 this is the greatest nation in the world yet people like me and my younger sister barbara are going through real hard times
8190898 i am determined to do well and get a degree and a different pay grade so i can live a better life and provide for my family but i am tired and overwhelmed
8190899 seventy percent of all the kids killed or wounded are from ieds
8190900 how can you not fund it its cost me politically but some things are worth losing elections over this is one
8190901 the general caution is that the economy of the country has slowed considerably over the last six months and iowa wont avoid that
8190902 now we have to look to the next month to see if it was part of a trend
8190903 we cautioned them that we should be more careful and not overextend the taxpayers
8190904 i guess a price will be paid now for the democrats overspending if that is inability to deal with flood relief or to have to go back and make adjustments to the budget
8190905 it is democrats who have filled the reserve funds back up and thank god we did
8190906 in light of this years historic flooding and natural disasters the governor is confident that state government with the help of our federal partners will be able to meet these challenges and help return life to normal for those affected
8190907 shoot just take pictures of what goes on at ragbrai every year
8190908 its the same thing theres lawyers theres judges all sorts of people misbehaving i mean really misbehaving i wasnt even misbehaving and you guys you have a ton of pictures you could take of all that
8190909 i mean you can go down to 801 grand and take pictures of our legislators you know at 11 oclock at night and you can do the same story
8190910 you remember the old standard for ethics your character is measured by how you behave when no one is looking
8190911 and so we set our standards of behavior at a certain level so that it doesnt matter whether the camera is there
8190912 theres this nonsense about whether they were of legal age
8190913 for a college president just to be involved in that situation even if they were all of legal age you just expect that people in that sort of position would set a better example like it or not they are supposed to be leaders
8190914 to be honest with you theres a group of people that when i cleaned house im speaking out of turn but i had to make a lot of changes at the college 13 or 14 years ago
8190915 theyre going to use your article thats what theyre going to do
8190916 its just disappointing to me that i cant go out on july 4th with my kids and just enjoy the time
8190917 we know the iowa values of faith hard work and common sense will guide us and strengthen us as we rebuild an even better safer and stronger state
8190918 his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8190919 john mccain supports being energy independent and advocates the use of alternative forms of energy including ethanol competing in the free market
8190920 the problem is they fall under the classification of an investor owned property
8190921 it is an asset for the owner its not their primary residence
8190922 it is not a rental it is not a business i have never collected a dime of rent
8190923 weve invested close to 60 years in this neighborhood and its like whats your name
8190924 im 57 years old im not prepared to take out another mortgage
8190925 truly are a business and they should operate that way
8190926 i didnt think just because they didnt own it they werent going to be addressed
8190927 this is for no profit whatsoever ive been turned down to get any help
8190928 one thing im very proud to say about the iowa caucuses is as iowa kind of set the tone for the volume of people that would participate iowa also set the tone for how this was going to be conducted
8190929 i always felt the best organizing education in american politics is iowa and the best teachers are you
8190930 and so know this that this campaign started in iowa and that even when it left iowa what you taught these folks mattered
8190931 it made no mistake where her heart and her mind and energy will be and that is about electing barack obama president
8190932 it was a reminder that this nations possibilities are more important than any one person or any one campaign
8190933 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8190934 i just thought she could not have done a better job of convincing her supporters that those who have gone to obama have done the right thing and that those who havent should feel comfortable
8190935 what a shame it is they cant both be president
8190936 i hope we never have to hear another word of whether hillary is doing her part
8190937 have done a very good job in iowa showing that we need to be and we are unified
8190938 i know its an open convention and people can do what they want to do but i dont think its helpful at all
8190939 before he made public accusations accusing a meatpacking plant of hiring 13 and 14 year olds only to avoid paying people decent wages and providing them decent benefits and declared that the minors were assigned to work with buzz saws and cleavers did senator obama look at the evidence or consider the plants categorical denial of these allegations
8190940 no one alleges that any employee who was later identified as under 18 was working at agriprocessors with buzz saws and cleavers
8190941 agriprocessors recruited only those who were over 18 and knowingly accepted for employment only applicants who said they were over 18
8190942 agriprocessors fired four girls in 2007 when it discovered from its own internal investigation that they were under age
8190943 the iowa labor department conducted an on site inspection in april 2008 with an expert at spotting minors and did not identify to agriprocessors any person on its workforce who looked to be under 18
8190944 this is a shocking statement from a former president of the harvard law review and former constitutional law professor who has sworn as a united states senator to uphold the constitution which prescribes a presumption of innocence until guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt
8190945 weve got to crack down on employers who are taking advantage of undocumented workers
8190946 when you read about a meatpacking plant hiring 13 year olds 14 year olds that is some of the most dangerous difficult work there is they have kids in there wielding buzz saws and cleavers its ridiculous and the only reason theyre hiring these folks is because they want to avoid paying decent wages and providing decent benefits

8190956 we were probably down about 40 kids and we probably picked up about 35 kids
8190957 i think everybody in town thought theyd be down more than that
8190958 quite passionate about trying to find housing for the less fortunate because thats what polk county does
8190959 i suppose if it happens in front of an officer it could be easily addressed but that would take time away from other things
8190960 i think people should be able to do what they want to do but be respectful of those around them
8190961 you have to watch him closer what he picks up
8190962 i dont tend to provide a great deal of stock in this because so few of our students take it and many of those students have their sights on an east coast college
8190963 the second shot was fired almost right after the first as the suspect began to raise the weapon and point it in my direction
8190964 as the suspect rounded a corner of the church i observed the suspect pull something from the pocket on the front of his sweatshirt but was not able to immediately identify it i then observed a bright flash and heard a loud pop which i instantly realized was a gunshot followed by a second
8190965 the first shot i could see went off in the direction of the suspects feet striking the ground as the suspect had not meant to fire the round
8190966 ive lived in beaverdale most of my life and this is the first time ive ever heard a gunshot
8190967 its creepy that there was someone creeping around outside with a gun and its even creepier that he fired it
8190968 borders are irrelevant when it comes to flood plain management
8190969 its the most hypocritical attack that ive ever seen in my life for the incumbents and the people in power to say that for some reason since ive chosen a catholic education for my kids that im not qualified its a red herring it is so hypocritical

8190971 well thats terrific my son studied in the best universities and became an engineer then he started his own construction company and is now a multimillionaire he also gave away something very nice and expensive to his best friend for his birthday a 30 000 square foot mansion
8190972 we were talking about the pride we feel for the successes of our sons what about your son
8190973 my son is gay and makes a living dancing as a disappointment
8190974 youre asking an awful lot of high school guidance counselors because the parents arent there to help students
8190975 when language is a factor it becomes extra challenging to meet the high standards
8190976 we really want to be culturally responsive in our teaching
8190977 i get the feeling were dwelling too much on the past
8190978 one of the things we need to focus on is early childhood development its very important
8190979 you can go get a new team with your vote the team you have today isnt winning
8190980 we need to find ways to develop our teachers professionally without asking them to take from their own pockets
8190981 you get things done when you work as a team the last thing you have to develop as a school board member is a thick skin for all of the stuff thats thrown at you
8190982 im the person most qualified to deal with these construction projects
8190983 corn and soybean prices have never been higher i definitely want to become a farmer
8190984 we certainly had enough rain in the spring and the floods didnt do much damage
8190985 things were really tough i wonder today how we survived
8190986 a few weeks ago my son contracted to sell some corn at 7 30 per bushel
8190987 earlier he had sold some for 6 50 per bushel i couldnt believe either of those numbers
8190988 everything is higher today whether its oil or fertilizer or land
8190989 but the risk is greater i wasnt nearly as scared back in the 1930s as i am now
8190990 i can remember selling corn for 90 cents per bushel during the 1960s
8190991 maar die wel wisten van zonde en genade en van behoud alleen door het offer van christus mensen die bogen voor het gezag van de schrift
8190992 alleen het geloof alleen de schrift maar ook heel de schrift en alleen door genade uitlopend in alleen door christus
8190993 tege lijkertijd moet de kinderdoop niet verabsoluteerd worden in die zin dat er geen omgang en herkenning zou kunnen zijn met degenen die alleen de volwassendoop praktiseren zeker als het gereformeerde baptisten betreft
8190994 niemand bedacht dit er circuleerde geen beleidsplan de duivel stond te blazen in het vuur om gods werk te doven maar in werkelijkheid moest hij eraan meewerken dat het vuur oplaaide

8191034 we are all well aware of south ossetias tragedy the night shelling of tskhinvali by the georgian troops led to the deaths of thousands of civilians russian peacekeepers have died but they did everything they could to protect the civilian population
8191035 the georgian government breaking un regulations and its obligations to the international community running counter to common sense started a military conflict which claimed many civilians lives tbilisi must have planned to carry out a blitzkrieg and chose the most inhumane way to annex south ossetia by destroying its whole population
8191036 the georgian leadership was getting ready for war step by step
8191037 and on the night of august 8 2008 tbilisi made its choice saakashvili chose genocide as a means to solve his political tasks doing this he destroyed with his own hands all hopes for the peaceful living of south ossetians abkhazians and georgians as part of one state
8191038 we understand that after what had happened in tskhinvali and what was planned to be done in abkhazia these people have a right to resolve their fates themselves
8191039 the federation council and the state duma of the russian federation voted in favour of these applications
8191040 we respect the free will of the south ossetian and abkhazian people and basing our actions on international regulations and documents i have signed an order to recognise the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia by the russian federation russia is also calling on other states to follow suit
8191041 it was a nation fulfilled prophecy it is what the us has long dreamed of hoped for and desired
8191042 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
8191043 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
8191044 the elite ruling class should have realized too that all along what needed to be contained was their misguided nation fulfilling prophecy to entrap and destroy russia
8191045 moscow wanted to send a message if you provoke us we will find ways to retaliate

8191048 an eyewitness to the subsequent violence and breakup of the country
8191049 the grossest calumny in the continuing anti serb bias in the british press is the myth that it was the serbs who were nationalists in fact they and many croats bosnians and kosovans were the multiethnic federalists seeking to preserve yugoslavia and the extreme nationalists were those who now govern the statelets of croatia muslim bosnia and albanian kosovo the eu supported and funded that nationalism which they condemn within the eu but which they exploit in order to undermine nation states outside the eu germanys interest in destroying both yugoslavia and czechoslovakia was to reverse the results of the first world war which established those states
8191050 a virulently anti serb agenda driven form of realpolitik that was to dominate americas bosnian policy
8191051 the truth is that there was no internal bosnian threat to peace at the beginning of 1991 yet once reunited germany was committed to the recognition of croatia and slovenia the muslim leadership in sarajevo knew both that the old yugoslavia was dead and that historic opportunities beckoned
8191052 an eyewitness to the subsequent violence and breakup of the country i also was a witness to the historical amnesia suffered by the political leaders of france britain the united states and my own country canada these countries were serbias old traditional allies in two world wars yet they shamefully stood by and joined in the betrayal of yugoslavia
8191053 the breakup of yugoslavia was a disaster for the serbian people thousands killed and many more thousands forced to flee their ancestral homelands yet the greatest tragedy of all is that the serbs have been blamed for everything that has happened since the breakup they have been blamed for the breakup itself they have been blamed for starting the violence they have been blamed for the ethnic cleansing that occurred they have been blamed for the massacres they have been blamed for genocide finally they have been blamed for the nato bombing of their own country
8191054 karadzic personally and the serbs collectively were severely damaged by the western media handling of their mistreatment of muslim prisoners and by their expulsion of non serb civilians in the summer of 1992 similar atrocities by croats and muslims against serbs and against each other while no less common were less conspicuous and deemed unworthy of attention the western elite class chose its sympathies at the start and kept up an agitation in favor of military intervention against the serbs
8191055 the judgment against karadzic at the u s sponsored and largely u s funded tribunal at the hague will be built on this flawed foundation it will be neither fair or just and therefore it will be detrimental to what america should stand for in the world it will also give further credence to the myth of muslim blameless victimhood serb viciousness and western indifference and therefore weaken our resolve in the global struggle euphemistically known as war on terrorism the former is a crime the latter a mistake
8191056 emphasis mine throughout holbrooke is right on the button with that statement
8191057 grisly incidents of croat and muslim atrocities against the serbs rarely made it into the u
8191058 the serbs were blamed for the infamous sarajevo market massacre but according to the report leaked out on french tv western intelligence knew that it was muslim operatives who had bombed bosnian civilians in the marketplace in order to induce nato involvement even international negotiator david owen who worked with cyrus vance admitted in his memoir that the nato powers knew all along that it was a muslim bomb
8191059 with the death of slobodan milosevic we still are getting cartoons and stories about the 200 000 people that milosevic supposedly killed only no one could find the bodies
8191060 it really does matter how many were killed the foreign policy and political implications are substantial there is a line between oppression and mass murder it is not a bright shining one but the distinction between hundreds of dead and tens of thousands is clear the blurring of that line has serious implications not merely for nato s integrity but for the notion of sovereignty if a handful or a few dozen people are killed in labor unrest does the international community have the right to intervene by force by the very rules that nato has set up the magnitude of slaughter is critical
8191061 the arrest of radovan karadzic has provided yet another occasion for all the tired old propaganda about the balkans wars to be taken out of the cupboard and given one last airing
8191062 t he serbs were no more the aggressors in the bosnian civil war than abraham lincoln was an aggressor in the american civil war the yugoslav army was in place all over bosnia herzegovina because that republic was part of yugoslavia bosnian muslims like croats left the army in droves and set up their own militia instead as part of their drive for independence from belgrade this meant that the yugoslav army lost its previous strongly multiethnic character and became largely serb it did not mean that serb forces entered the territory of bosnia or even that the serbs attacked the hapless bosnian muslims
8191063 in fact the bosnian serb war effort was no more or less legitimate than the bosnian muslim war effort the muslims wanted to secede from yugoslavia and were egged on to do this by the americans and the europeans while the bosnian serbs wanted to stay in yugoslavia it was as simple as that
8191064 in any case once the muslims had seized power in sarajevo the bosnian serbs sought not to conquer the whole republic but instead simply to fight for the secession of their territories from muslim control if the muslims had the right unilaterally to secede from yugoslavia why should the bosnian serbs not have had the right unilaterally to secede from the new state of bosnia herzegovina which had never before existed as a state and to which the bosnian serbs had no loyalty whatever
8191065 what is clear is that the srebrenica massacre cannot possibly be described as genocide even the most ardent pro muslim propagandists agree that the victims of the massacre there were all men the bosnian serbs claim that they were combatants although that is certainly not an excuse for killing them but the point is that an army bent on genocide would precisely not have singled out men for execution but would have killed women too
8191066 the srebrenica massacre may well have been a crime against humanity but it is impossible to see how it can be categorized as genocide
8191067 in other words far from bringing peace to the balkans it is quite possible that a conviction of karadzic for genocide will reopen the dayton settlement and egg the muslims on to claim control over the serb republic too
8191068 as far as i know nobodys made any announcements or decisions about retiring
8191069 the main thing if a guy is going back that he has the hunger for it but that goes for everybody theres no reason then why he cant go back
8191070 will i be back the key is to make sure you have the hunger if you dont you see what happened to us against kilkenny and youre not doing anyone justice or yourself justice if you dont have that hunger
8191071 you must have that hunger fellas talk about the summer but the tough time is during the winter and preparing for it and im no different maybe i have to test myself this winter to see if i have that hunger
8191072 during the summer youre not training as much you rest between games its during the winter you have the serious training guys know themselves they know if they have it or if they dont
8191073 there were certain situations we were in this year and the lads showed great character but as with all other teams if you dont win the all ireland you look back on the year as a failure thats what makes sport at this level tough
8191074 its up to gerald and hell know what he wants to do himself
8191075 any manager coming into a setup that we had from 2003 to 2006 there are going to be issues as the new man has new ideas setanta readers comment of the day yes but refs have to be given power to stamp it out
8191076 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8191077 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8191078 i cant say if ive been included in the andriy shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to abramovich it wasnt me
8191079 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8191080 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8191081 i know theres been some conjecture about whether hes going to be captaining ireland but i would imagine hes going to be captain of ireland
8191082 for him it will mean not having as much responsibility all the time and i dont see the point in him having all the responsibility here and then all the responsibility with ireland as well
8191083 i think for him its an opportunity to concentrate on his game number one without worrying about the whole team too and also i think hes going to be the national captain as well
8191084 he himself and i agree with him think its an opportunity for him to focus on the quality he can produce in both of those arenas i dont want to ask him to do too much
8191085 he captained leinster a few times when brian was injured last year
8191086 hes got a lot of respect among the players hes got good delegation skills as well and hes obviously got aspirations higher up the chain himself so its a matter of managing him
8191087 i was under the impression he had left the club until i discovered he had another year on his contract

8191111 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8191112 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8191113 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8191114 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8191115 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8191159 das wurde aber auch langsam zeit schlie lich fordert die vp wien schon seit jahren dass die suchtpr vention f r kinder und jugendliche in den mittelpunkt der drogenarbeit der stadt r ckt
8191160 diese erkenntnis im jahr 2008 als novum zu verkaufen erscheint ein bisschen seltsam
8191161 sucht bedeutet leid sowohl f r die betroffenen als auch f r angeh rige f r wirksamen schutz der jugend sind daher fl chendeckende pr ventionsma nahmen an wiens schulen unerl sslich nur wer den ursachen der sucht auf den grund geht und dabei massiv in pr ventionsma nahmen investiert kann effektiv helfen ein gesundes selbstwertgef hl ist bekanntlich der beste schutz gegen drogenabh ngigkeit und darauf muss auch bei der arbeit mit kindern und jugendlichen viel mehr wert gelegt werden
8191162 nachdem festgestellt werden konnte dass verteidigungsminister darabos bez glich des alternativen angebots die unwahrheit gesagt best tigt der rechungshofsbericht einen zweiten fall betreffend der flugstunden der gebrauchten eurofighter
8191163 laut parlamentarischer anfragebeantwortung 1624 ab vom 7 dezember 2007 w rden die sechs gebrauchten eurofighter der deutschen luftwaffe durchschnittlich 144 flugstunden aufweisen jedoch teile das verteidigungsministerium dem rechungshof mit dass im oktober 2007 ein stand von 207 flugstunden erreicht sein wird das ministerium ging im juni 2007 weiters davon aus dass die gebrauchten flugzeuge 150 bis 200 flugstunden im einsatz waren dieser wert wurde aber bereits im oktober 2007 berschritten es ist unklar wie viele flugstunden die gebrauchten eurofighter bis zur auslieferung 2009 aufweisen werden dies ist deshalb von bedeutung da die lebensdauer ma geblich vom verschlei beeinflusst wird wie der rechungshof auch festgehalten hat
8191164 darabos hat wieder einmal das parlament im dunkeln tappen lassen um seine fehler bei den verhandlungen zu kaschieren es wurden keine maximalwerte bei den flugstunden eingefordert und die definition ber den zustand der gebrauchten flugzeuge ist u erst ungenau und berl sst der eurofighter gmbh jeglichen spielraum die vp soll zu dieser causa endlich farbe bekennen es reicht nicht wenn man darabos nahelegt zur ckzutreten oder dem bundespr sidenten mitzuteilen er m ge darabos nicht mehr mit der amtsf hrung nach der wahl betrauen wenn es der vp in dieser sache ernst ist muss sie einem misstrauensantrag der opposition zustimmen
8191165 kreuzungen zwischen stra en und eisenbahnen sind besonders gef hrliche punkte wir wollen daher diese kreuzungen sicherer machen
8191166 dass die vp diese sp rbare und dringend notwendige entlastung einfach abschmettert ist traurig dass sie f r ihre ablehnung aber auch noch das argument der sozialen treffsicherheit vorschiebt ist unredlich und unglaubw rdig
8191167 wie glaubw rdig ist die angebliche sorge der vp ber die soziale treffsicherheit wenn sie gleichzeitig die jungen familien mit kleinen kindern von der erh hung der familienbeihilfe ausnehmen will
8191168 und wie glaubw rdig ist die angebliche sorge der vp ber die soziale treffsicherheit wenn sie gerade familien mit niedrigen einkommen von der absetzbarkeit der kinderbetreuungskosten ausnehmen will
8191169 ich gehe nicht davon aus dass jemand der keine steuern bezahlt sich eine h usliche betreuung aufnimmt
8191170 wir wollen rasch den negativen auswirkungen der teuerung entgegenwirken die halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel ist dabei ein wichtiger beitrag wir laden alle parteien ein gemeinsam echte entlastungsschritte zu setzen
8191171 nach unseren erfahrungen sichern sich unsere kunden zwar immer dann den g nstigsten preis wenn sie so lange wie m glich im voraus buchen doch wenn die mietwagenanbieter am ort zum ende der hauptsaison freie kapazit ten haben gehen die preise teilweise auch wieder nach unten
8191172 auch heuer werden wieder rund 10 000 wohnungen in wien mit unterst tzung aus mitteln der wiener wohnbauf rderung saniert durch die f rderungen setzen wir f r private hauseigent mer nicht nur anreize ihre h user zu revitalisieren sondern wir gew hrleisten damit auch die einhaltung hoher qualit tsstandards dabei steht die verbesserung des wohnkomforts und die steigerung der energieeffizienz der geb ude im mittelpunkt
8191173 besonders thermisch energetische sanierungen bringen eine deutliche ersparnis beim heizw rmebedarf und damit auch bei den heizkosten mit sich diese sind jedoch f r die hauseigent merinnen und hauseigent mer mit einem gr eren aufwand verbunden daher gibt es seit dem jahr 2000 eine spezielle thewosan f rderschiene
8191174 es handelt sich hierbei um ein typisches 60er jahre wohnhaus das ber keine architektonischen besonderheiten verf gt durch die thermisch energetische sanierung konnte der heizw rmebedarf des geb udes der rund 114 3 kilowattstunden pro quadratmeter und jahr betrug auf beeindruckende 29 8 kilowattstunden gesenkt werden und entspricht nun dem ausgezeichneten standard eines niedrigenergiehauses
8191175 durch betr chtliche f rdermittel und durch sehr viel informations und beratungsarbeit die der wohnfonds wien die gebietsbetreuungen stadterneuerung und die bezirksvertretungen leisten versuchen wir noch mehr private hauseigent merinnen und hauseigent mer ins boot zu holen und f r eine thewosan sanierung zu gewinnen mit erfolg denn allein in ottakring gibt es viele weitere projekte f r thermisch energetische sanierungen
8191176 eine tatsache die mich als bezirksvorsteher nat rlich besonders freut
8191177 denn neben einer gesteigerten wohnzufriedenheit durch die qualitative anhebung des wohnangebots gestalten sich die erneuerungsbed rftigen gr tzel ottakrings zunehmend attraktiver und erleben wie das beispiel des brunnenmarktviertels wunderbar zeigt einen aufschwung
8191178 gro e ansage keine umsetzung so muss man das gro angek ndigte forst und radwegprojekt

8191180 es gibt eine w nschenswerte und eine machbare variante wir haben uns f r den bau der machbaren entschlossen
8191181 dass wir uns nicht mehr von leeren versprechungen bremsen lassen sondern das projekt an der b 99 umgehend in die projektverfahren
8191182 das wird auch der ank nder martinz und seine freunde in seeboden akzeptieren m ssen die radler wollen l sungen und keine weiteren worth lsen

8191370 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8191371 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8191372 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8191373 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately

8191382 i might have to get myself involved a bit believe it or not which i do not really want to have to do the players are good enough
8191383 if you had given me three wins out of four i certainly would have taken it if we can get a point at boreham wood then we will reach our target of ten
8191384 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8191385 i was wishing to see my wife at the time but all that happened you know very well

8191454 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8191455 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8191456 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico

8191461 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8191462 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8191463 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8191469 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre

8191498 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8191499 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8191500 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8191501 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8191502 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8191503 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8191504 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8191505 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8191506 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8191507 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8191508 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8191509 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8191510 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8191511 no one works for someone we all just work together
8191512 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8191513 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8191514 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8191515 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8191516 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8191517 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8191518 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8191519 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

8191544 the two hijackers and the crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8191545 at the moment there is no information on why the man hijacked the plane the only demands we know about are for food and fuel and to allow the plane to fly to france
8191546 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had co ordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8191547 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8191548 everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8191549 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8191550 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8191551 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future

8191557 it is a step forward and strengthens the club in the short term
8191558 the decision was taken to ensure that the club is going to be able to keep growing and look towards the young players coming through
8191559 we can keep our best youngsters now a club like this with a unique model has to consolidate and keep growing
8191560 if we want to stop clubs such as liverpool and tottenham from coming over and taking our best youth team players we have to give them contracts that they want
8191561 in the world of football this is how things are the club has to negotiate in order to settle its economic resources and decisions are made that sensible
8191562 i have asked the anti ragging committee to inquire into the matter and identify the students involved in this sadistic act
8191563 the college principal has been asked to take action against the students if they are found involved in ragging

8191565 accredited persons have a key role to play in the delivery of neighbourhood policing and are an important part of the extended police family
8191566 this is a sinister move towards a stasi snooper state in which jobsworths are devolved the powers of the police including the right to demand you identify yourself
8191567 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens

8191617 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised
8191618 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use
8191619 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing

8191621 hochrangige vertreter der energie ag haben sich jedenfalls im mai 2008 erstaunt gezeigt dass es eine politische vorgabe zur reduktion des atomstromanteils f r ihr unternehmen gebe ob die ank ndigung dass die energie ag den atomstromanteil reduzieren wird reine taktik war oder ein kommunikationsproblem zwischen eigent mervertreter land o und dem vorstand der energie ag besteht konnten wir nicht endg ltig abkl ren

8191644 hemos respondido a los requerimientos de la ce suministrando evidencias documentales de la venta ilegal de billetes de avi n que ha sido perpetrada a los consumidores por parte de estas agencias online
8191645 es destacable pero no sorprendente que un n mero de agencias comunitarias y la ce hayan tratado de culpar a ryanair de bloquear las actividades ilegales de estas agencias en vez de abordar el verdadero esc ndalo que esconde aumentos de precio del 200 y el 300 que han sido cargados a unos consumidores inocentes

8191648 some argue that the gold tally is evidence of an improved investment in sport healthcare and social security but this is an outrageous claim more accurate indicators are the low levels of health insurance coverage or consider why the quality of school dinners is declining even as more and more golf courses are opened
8191649 in a country that has only a rudimentary healthcare and social security system the amazing gold haul shows how individuals are sacrificed for the nationalist priorities that shape the sports system it is a manifestation of the huge gap between rich and poor success and failure every gold comes at a cost the price is the health and welfare of the broader population

8191651 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk

8191664 the two hijackers and the crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8191665 the planes pilot has indicated that the hijackers have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8191666 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8191667 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8191668 if libyan leader colonel moamer kadhafi can convince the hijackers and not harm the lives of the passengers thats good but otherwise everything must be done for the passengers lives
8191669 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods

8191672 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian airplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorites in kufra airport
8191673 we cannot accept these violations of all international law of security and co operation accords in europe united nations resolutions and for the first time in a long time the taking of territory by an army in a neighbouring country
8191674 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force
8191675 there is very little that saakashvilis government can do at the moment apart from attempting to solidify support inside his own country
8191676 what hes doing right now is attempting to galvanise a sense of statehood a sense of national unity and hes using the greater international community europe the united states international institutions like nato and the eu to try and give his leadership a degree of weight

8191750 my winemaking philosophy evolved from a deceptively simple statement my grandmother used to say to me make good wine
8191751 by that she meant make wine that invites a second glass and so my goal was to create powerful yet elegant wines from the highest quality napa valley grapes that could be enjoyed on their own or with a meal
8191752 when i saw the land that would later become my amino vineyard i knew id found the place that would mark my return to winemaking
8191753 the first vintages from amino didnt reflect the level of maturity that was needed for the style of wine i was after so i decided to wait until i felt the grapes reached their full potential the 2005 vintage produced fruit of exceptional quality and i felt the resulting wine was finally ready for debut
8191754 companies that have chosen not to implement network virtualization in their virtual datacenter are only realizing part of the benefits
8191755 server and storage virtualization has cut provisioning times from days or weeks to minutes but manually provisioning correct vlan and security configurations still takes days or weeks delaying roll outs and exposing servers to a new class of security risks network virtualization closes this gap and completes the virtual datacenter
8191756 tbdvirtualfabric vme naturally extends the benefits that vmware and vmotion create in current virtual environments
8191757 it delivers benefits of full datacenter virtualization within minutes of installation tbdvirtualfabric vme automatically discovers the entire physical and virtual network including firewalls switches and vlans and gives administrators an intuitive gui to define network topologies high availability and security policies the result is a virtualized environment that complies with enterprise standards and scales to large deployments without giving up on the flexibility of datacenter wide vmotion

8191759 i am continuously amazed at how few resources we put towards the brain when it is the most complex organ in the human body we are murdering ourselves more than others yet we hide it under the rug shadowed by shame what is happening that is making us turn against ourselves
8191760 we spend billions on wars across the globe and i wonder when we are going to spend that kind of money finding peaceful resolutions to the wars going on in the mind depression has taken the lives of many way too early wasted so many good years for others and it is time we understand why and encourage people to get treatment so they can improve the lives of all

8191764 at clearwave we are working to help the health care industry shift its mentality to one that is focused on conducting business at the time of service where eligibility and benefits can be immediately verified and patient payment accepted

8191786 i was shocked to see that only 20 of survey respondents strongly agreed that they know who their best shoppers are

8191788 we are actively seeking property owners in the jackson hole market areas who want to auction their property for 100 percent of the current market value with no seller commission to enter their properties prior to the monday september 1st deadline
8191789 as one of only 322 accredited auctioneers of real estates aare in the united states we can deliver a higher level of service than 98 6 of real estate professionals in the marketplace
8191790 last year we auctioned two homes in teton springs and delivered 660 000 and 715 000 for a private seller who had purchased based on pre construction appraisals with inflated resale values of 1 4 to 1 6 million each our seller could not make the 18 000 payments for property in a subdivision that only had two arms length transactions during 2007 and they had no hope of selling using traditional methods
8191791 if you read the newspapers listen to the radio or watch the news on tv the message is nothing but doom and gloom about the real estate market
8191792 if you are trying to sell using the broken list price put up a sign and place it in the mls methods they are correct and your property can sit on the market for years with no bids or contingency
8191793 people selling real estate in the jackson hole market think they are immune to the nationwide correction in real estate values with almost every agent saying the same things agents in orange county california were telling us two years ago which is it cant happen here there is too much demand prices will never go down
8191794 july 2008 saw an actual 28 percent across the board decrease in orange county property values
8191795 this could be the tip of the iceberg or the prices can hold the line depending on a number of factors outside of the control of sellers agents or the local market
8191796 the good news is an auction is an event where bidders win the property and are happy knowing they only paid one bid more than someone else was willing to pay
8191797 competitive bidding will deliver 100 percent of the present cash market value for a property on a specific date in
8191798 this is the selling event of the season if a property owner wants to sell their property on september 20th this auction event will simply deliver more marketing firepower than the local agents are capable of delivering

8191811 this site used to employ over 500 workers from september it will employ 120 workers
8191812 that is bad for australian industry its bad for members and its bad for jobs
8191813 we believe there will be a significant number of component suppliers in victoria that will be announcing reductions as a consequence of the reduced manufacturing schedule of the companies like ford
8191814 theres a really bad air of uncertainty here at the place
8191815 i dont think the government is doing a hell of a lot to help us
8191816 the open source development model is unique end users not only give feedback on the software theyre a fundamental and critical part of the community submitting patches and developing new features themselves

8191818 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8191819 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8191820 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect

8191962 it seems to me to be unconvincing that a huge large amount of money will improve your reputation it just means that your lawyers are better than the other persons lawyers but to have the court stating that certain things are untrue seems to me to be emphatic

8191967 the consumer electronics and mobile communications fields are much more dynamic than the previous mainstay markets for mems i e inkjet heads diverse industrial applications and automotive uses
8191968 existing companies have a great opportunity to ride this wave and new players have a chance to address a relatively open market however deep r amp d pockets are essential to compete in this area and the companies that will succeed will be those that bet on and invest in building dedicated mass production facilities

8191986 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8191987 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording

8192001 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8192002 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8192003 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8192004 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8192005 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8192006 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8192007 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8192008 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8192015 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8192016 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8192017 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighbourhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighbourhood in that cell
8192018 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
8192019 we now know that not all the enzymes in the cell are doing the same job just like in real estate its all about the location

8192023 whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8192024 in addition one large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8192025 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis
8192026 for people at risk for high bp if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure
8192027 planet mars will be the brightest in the night sky starting aug 27 when mars comes within 34 65 million miles off earth
8192028 be sure to watch the sky aug 27 12 30 a m it will look like the earth has 2 moons the next time mars may come this close is in 2287 due to the way jupiters gravity tugs on mars and perturbs its orbit astronomers can only be certain that mars has not come this close to earth in the last 5 000 years
8192029 how can mars come closer to earth when its orbit is fixed
8192030 the buyout is part of our two fold strategy in the short term it will de risk us from the impact of tech slowdown in the us market though it will continue to be a major revenue contributor
8192031 in the long term such inorganic growth will enable us to expand our global footprint in client servicing and revenue generation
8192032 we have been scouting for such a strategic fit in line with our global delivery model gdm apart from increasing our revenue from europe axon will be a new engine for growth worldwide
8192033 the buyout will also enable us to pitch for large deals by cross selling its domain expertise in sap to our global clients
8192034 the acquisition signals that the indian it industry is not only resilient in the midst of a global slowdown but also very dynamic to sustain growth it will spur a fresh wave of inorganic growth
8192035 this is the space where we have good growth and there is good demand for sap services
8192036 axon is projected to post revenue of 250 million pounds by the end of its fiscal in december which will shore up our topline by 500 million after the acquisition process is completed
8192037 retention will enable us to leverage their skills sets and provide a cultural fit for servicing axons clients in europe and other countries as a policy we will continue to hire talent which is multiethnic and near shore

8192042 baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8192043 a memo was put on our chairs today about instant replay and im not excited about reading it i dont want to sound like an old timer but baseball is a game of history and tradition in my opinion instant replay goes against that
8192044 this is an aspect of the game that could potentially hurt more than it helps where does it stop why is the home run call more important than any other part of the game a called third strike a close play at plate the home run call can be difficult but in my opinion its an easier call than a check swing or a bang bang play at a base where does it go from here
8192045 its ok for homers i think that should be the extent of it if you go any farther the game would become too detailed and stop being baseball
8192046 its a good thing to do because sometimes the umpires are wrong
8192047 this is the way the game is changing and evolving theres nothing wrong with getting a call right
8192048 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8192049 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over

8192053 the brains ability to reorganise itself is much greater than previously believed
8192054 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight
8192055 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8192056 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8192057 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8192058 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8192059 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8192060 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8192061 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8192062 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8192063 we are trying to divert the traffic on nh 2 national highway 2 a team of district administration officials tuesday requested trinamool chief mamata banerjee to withdraw the road blockade at least from one flank of the durgapur expressway

8192071 the retraction of the expropriation bill is proof of the power which civil society can exert when its organisations co operate with each other
8192072 the expropriation bills stipulation that the expropriation amount may be less than the market value of the property and that market value will not be the determining factor would have deterred local as well as international investors had it been implemented
8192073 advice sought by the portfolio committee indicated that more time was needed to ensure that a wide variety of stakeholders had been consulted and that public participation may have been insufficient to see the bill through

8192104 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8192105 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8192106 it was a genuinely difficult moment in the campaign for them and him and he did a risky thing gave an extremely well received speech and came out of it stronger if anything
8192107 there are very few politicians who would have been capable of that not only demonstrating the willingness to confront it but also coming out ahead of it at the end of the confrontation

8192159 the weakness of the u s dollar against the euro has a negative impact on nearly all fashion trade fairs in europe
8192160 a considerably lower number of american visitors can afford or want to attend such trade fairs as gds at this time the expenses incurred in the fair participation the accommodations food and beverages would be too high at the same time it does not pay for american buyers to include european labels in their offerings as these goods have become more and more expensive during the last months due to the present rate of exchange
8192161 it is clear we are talking to two very different audiences with two different trade shows
8192162 the differential between the low market and the medium high market is bigger than before
8192163 the cost of the fabric in europe has remained quite high thats why the labels that find a solution in china can do business at this moment

8192166 the italian and french markets are very bad there is a big crisis in japan the japanese are buying less with the u s dollar americans buy less too
8192167 the economic downturn is normal you cant have business always going up
8192168 even if americans buy only seven pairs who cares its still so much and there is so much room for growth in china
8192169 they see china as a huge market but they are also coming to establish joint ventures for production which makes sense because they are so far away
8192170 but the government doesnt want factories anymore they are pushing the manufacturers to upgrade to establish brand names and add value they want more than workers salaries
8192171 in difficult times we tell exhibitors that even if the u s is going dim china is the bright spot
8192172 and remember the u s is still more than 55 percent of the worlds export market and there is still opportunity for growth

8192183 to deliver rich real time content we can now talk of broadband 2 0 providing speeds of multiple mbits s per customer simultaneously
8192184 probably the best example of competition starting to really bite in south africa has been in the broadband internet services arena until recently this competitive behaviour has been largely driven by the mobile operators which have introduced globally competitive mobile data prices in south africa
8192185 when neotel launched its fixed wireless voice and data services in april 2008 this added a new dimension of competition in the broadband internet market due to the attractively prices data packages including those for seriously data intensive users

8192228 amanda dennis alun and james have brought real depth warmth and humour to their characters but i know there is still much more we can do with the series
8192229 it is the shows ability to be both humorously entertaining and from time to time tackle darker issues which keeps all the team keen to come back and make next year even better

8192235 people still wait to have some free time to go to las vegas casinos but they dont have to wait anymore now they can play casino games for real money on the internet or bet on sports without collecting money for one big trip
8192236 players may play the games in a few seconds they may be sure they will get their wins and they may get great bonuses and things for free that is why online casinos are better than those in las vegas and when you have some free time you can go to some nice tropical island not to noisy las vegas

8192241 there is still a relatively large gap between china and the best in the world in the high profile items like athletics swimming and cycling and also in the popular ball sports
8192242 also we have already mined our full potential in our strong sports at beijing
8192243 these problems require earnest reflection to build courage from shame and to make up lost ground
8192244 as soon as we step off the podium everything starts from zero

8192246 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse

8192251 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8192252 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8192253 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8192254 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8192255 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8192256 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8192257 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8192258 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8192259 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8192260 the united states should call for a meeting of the united nations security council to condemn russias decision in coordination with our european allies
8192261 georgias economic recovery is an urgent strategic priority that demands the focused attention of the united states and our allies
8192262 russias government must respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and other independent states
8192263 let us be clear no one wants to see another cold war with russia the united states and russia have many mutual interests and russia has the potential to become a critical stakeholder in the international system but russias recent choices not american or european decisions are threatening this potential and reminding us all that peace and security in europe cannot be taken for granted
8192264 i first met john mccain when he became the navys liaison to the united states senate when i was republican leader
8192265 he traveled abroad with me on many occasions and i had the opportunity to observe first hand his ability to relate with foreign leaders i have a high regard respect and confidence in his unique ability to lead our country as our next president
8192266 the volunteer state is uniting behind john mccain because he has the judgment integrity and experience to lead
8192267 former senator baker and i have been friends and colleagues for many years his guidance and leadership will be a tremendous asset to my campaign i am also very grateful for the support of our entire tennessee team and i am confident their hard work and efforts will result in victory on november 4th
8192268 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards we have now lived through first so called economic expansion on record where typical families saw their incomes fall and working age households lost more than 2 000 from their paychecks another 816 000 americans fell into poverty in 2007 including nearly 500 000 children bringing the total increase in americans in poverty under president bush to 5 7 million and on bushs watch an additional 7 2 million americans have fallen into the ranks of the uninsured this is the failed record of george bushs economic policies that senator mccain has called great progress while senator mccain is promising four more years of the failed bush economic policies my economic plan will restore bottom up economic growth that benefits all americans by cutting taxes for working americans providing affordable accessible health care for all and investing in new energy education and infrastructure so we can create millions of good jobs here in america

8192272 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently
8192273 mdc views this continued harassment and arrest of mdc legislators by the state security agents as a direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe

8192276 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8192277 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8192278 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect
8192279 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse

8192285 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8192286 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8192287 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8192288 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8192289 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8192290 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8192291 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8192292 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8192293 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8192294 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8192295 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8192296 the match in vadodara will feature all the probables for the test series against australia
8192297 we would like to use that time to get our best players to play in domestic cricket and prepare in the best manner possible for the very important series against australia
8192298 what we are also planning at this stage is to organise a comprehensive camp for our players ahead of that series
8192299 we are also keen to have the mohammad nissar trophy on september 15 in delhi between the domestic champions of india and pakistan too there is also the important series two tests between india a and australia a starting in bangalore on september 3 we would like to focus on these events and i dont think anything else is possible
8192300 pakistan sri lanka and south africa have confirmed for a quadrangular one day tournament in south africa while india australia or new zealand will most likely be filling in the final spot
8192301 for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand and that is making sure that liverpool reach the group stages
8192302 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8192303 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8192304 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8192305 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8192306 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8192307 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change

8192323 the strong trading performance during the period has so far been maintained into the early weeks of the second half year although the global macro environment is deteriorating

8192327 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
8192328 if everything is under control you are not going fast enough
8192329 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
8192330 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
8192331 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
8192332 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of information on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
8192333 in terms of usability and public impact it is of great interest
8192334 workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your day to day activities of collecting information structuring it making sense of it and creating new information and communicating it
8192335 but not much for the users eye so far we only use it for tags ratings and comments as well as metadata cached from files for fast searches in 4 1 you only see the tagging and rating interfaces in apps like dolphin or gwenview
8192336 experimental tools exist that allow you to relate people to files pictures for example or other people or to tag web sites but in the future neomuk is supposed to be combined with way more applications important of course are the kde pim applications such as kmail and kaddressbook kmail developers for example have plans to provide virtual email folders through nepomuk also a service will extract contacts from kde pim and link them to emails im accounts and dates and thus provide an abstract view of the people you know
8192337 there should be no distinction for you between an email address and an im account
8192338 there are so many ideas in my head and not only in mine
8192339 so its an end in itself certainly it offers new ways of building applications and we certainly hope that will fly
8192340 because it provides an environment that makes it easy to annotate your information and because it helps you in maintaining your information which means we have a very personal motivation to annotate your information and then we have the initial starting point

8192360 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8192361 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8192362 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8192363 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8192364 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8192365 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8192366 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8192367 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8192368 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8192369 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8192370 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8192371 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8192374 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8192375 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
8192376 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8192377 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8192378 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8192379 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8192380 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8192381 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8192382 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8192383 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8192384 we stand by our actions during the research and development process of the david babaii for wildaid hair care line and believe that 220 laboratories allegations are baseless and without any merit if we are formally served with the complaint we will vigorously defend this claim
8192385 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8192386 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8192387 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8192388 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8192389 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8192390 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8192391 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8192392 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8192393 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8192394 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8192395 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8192396 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8192397 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8192398 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8192399 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8192400 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8192413 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
8192414 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms

8192419 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

8192423 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8192424 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8192425 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8192426 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8192427 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8192428 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8192429 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8192430 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8192431 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8192432 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8192433 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8192434 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8192435 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8192436 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8192437 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8192438 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8192439 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8192440 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8192441 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8192442 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8192443 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8192444 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8192445 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8192446 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8192447 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8192448 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8192449 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8192450 the ridership capacity of the lrta lines is unprecedented it is in fact the biggest riding capacity
8192451 schmuck this place is special its your first day back in 5 weeks go for it
8192452 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8192453 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8192454 as far as research results are made public researchers can use these facilities for free
8192455 researchers will be able to study some lighter atoms that x rays cannot analyse most notably those of water
8192456 this means they could unzip the mechanism of any living organism whose main part consists of water and this will hopefully lead to further development of for example cosmetics and frozen food products
8192457 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8192458 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8192459 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8192460 weve been committed to taking the practical steps to sustainability
8192461 there are a number of things you can do that are not outrageous but are responsible and use good common sense
8192462 were really proud of the steps weve taken and if you compare another event thats taking place the next week we feel really good about our track record
8192463 having someone stand next to a trash can i dont think so
8192464 we are trying to be stewards of the environment and are trying to encourage others to be
8192465 the republican party is home to theodore roosevelt who was the first american president to consider the long term needs for efficient conservation of natural resources
8192466 its more important what they talk about inside the convention the campaign platforms have to match the behavior
8192467 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8192468 they have the human resources which is the most important
8192469 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8192470 we have enough stock of food grains but the problem is that we have limited means of transport to supply them among the villagers
8192471 weve unwound all gains since january so after such a fierce move i think technically it suggests the aussie may be due for a bit of consolidation
8192472 theres a long way to go on the us housing correction theres still a huge overhang of inventory and the sales that we are seeing are being generated on much lower prices
8192473 the interest rate differentials are certainly when you look in the big scheme of things are not going to move in the aussies favour any time soon
8192474 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8192475 i was wishing to see my wife at the time but all that happened you know very well
8192476 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8192477 she was fortunate enough to have doctors on board the flight

8192480 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
8192481 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
8192482 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of information on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
8192483 in terms of usability and public impact it is of great interest
8192484 workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your day to day activities of collecting information structuring it making sense of it and creating new information and communicating it
8192485 but not much for the users eye so far we only use it for tags ratings and comments as well as metadata cached from files for fast searches in 4 1 you only see the tagging and rating interfaces in apps like dolphin or gwenview
8192486 experimental tools exist that allow you to relate people to files pictures for example or other people or to tag web sites but in the future neomuk is supposed to be combined with way more applications important of course are the kde pim applications such as kmail and kaddressbook kmail developers for example have plans to provide virtual email folders through nepomuk also a service will extract contacts from kde pim and link them to emails im accounts and dates and thus provide an abstract view of the people you know
8192487 there should be no distinction for you between an email address and an im account
8192488 there are so many ideas in my head and not only in mine
8192489 so its an end in itself certainly it offers new ways of building applications and we certainly hope that will fly
8192490 because it provides an environment that makes it easy to annotate your information and because it helps you in maintaining your information which means we have a very personal motivation to annotate your information and then we have the initial starting point
8192491 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8192492 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8192493 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8192494 i think that to get good information you need a little contention
8192495 they see how nice the town looks and they want to lock the door and not let anyone else in
8192496 the board will be objective in meeting the needs of both the old and new residents as this town belongs to everyone that calls ancram their home
8192497 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8192498 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges
8192499 were going as quickly as we can and the town is not facing emergency services being cut or anything like that
8192500 golly this is just a small town in the hudson valley

8192508 obama schlie t damit eine offene flanke die er gegen ber mccain hat

8192519 ci che pu dare valore a tutta la nostra libert ha esordito rose qualcosa di pi grande un rapporto un io che appartiene diviene protagonista perch ha un volto
8192520 tu hai un valore infinito pi dellorrore della guerra e della malattia il riconoscimento di quellaltro che crea la realt e resta presente nella compagnia della chiesa rende la vita danzante
8192521 sono qui per raccontarvi una storia una storia triste certamente ma che ci dice che possibile vivere felici anche in mezzo alle atrocit
8192522 sono arrivati da me successivamente anche bambini dal ruanda e bambini congolesi e chiedevo signore che vocazione mi vuoi attribuire la risposta lho trovata negli occhi dei bambini ho capito quindi che la vita una festa e lamore trionfa sempre
8192523 questo il frutto della follia dicono alcuni mi chiamano ha notato la barankitse la pazza del burundi ma io dico che questo il frutto dellamore invece di maledire le tenebre accendiamo una piccola candela come diceva la grande madre teresa di calcutta
8192524 tra il 98 e il 2001 abbiamo vissuto come in un altro mondo pur rimanendo sulla terra abbandonati da tutti io ed i tre figli nessuno ci sorrideva tutti ci odiavano
8192525 i volontari sono riusciti a catturami ha raccontato vicky tramite mio figlio lhanno preparato per il trattamento medico a questo punto ho incominciato a capire che potevo fidarmi un giorno sono andata nellufficio di rose mi ha guardato negli occhi e mi ha detto vicky tu hai un valore e questo valore pi grande della malattia tu ce la puoi fare hai solo bisogno di ritrovare la speranza e gli occhi di rose parlavano pi della sua bocca erano occhi di amore come se dicessero c qualcosa sopra di te in cui devi riporre la tua speranza
8192526 mi sono resa conto che il volto di dio era nel volto di rose rose mi ha dato una spalla sulla quale appoggiarmi e cristo sotto forma di rose venuto da me tutto cominciato con un incontro e questo incontro ha fatto risorgere la mia vita
8192527 iniziato con rose che ha detto di s alla sua chiamata sappiamo di lazzaro che resuscitato tanto tempo fa se non avete visto un miracolo eccolo sono io eccomi qua anchio infatti ero morta ecco perch ha aggiunto vicky io sono schiava di questo movimento che mi accompagna verso il mio destino e mi ha aiutato a riacquistare la speranza per avere la propria libert c solo una cosa da fare dire di s quando arriva la chiamata
8192528 the two hijackers and the crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8192529 nobody could sing the new tracks recorded in nyc and at that point they were experimenting too much in my opinion they didnt know what the hell they were looking for
8192530 we want ed to learn how the studio work ed we didnt want somebody else doing it its our music we want ed to do it
8192531 far out even too far out we werent making a record in the normal sense we were making a collage
8192532 the most unreasonable project with which we have ever involved ourselves
8192533 whatever feedback that im getting and whenever the people come up to me and say that they are really looking forward to my film thats very encouraging and acts like a moral booster for me we have worked very hard for something that is not considered normal as the film has rock band in the background im also very sure that the emotional content of this film is something that the people will connect with so im very excited and i am looking forward to sharing this movie with the audience
8192534 i play a sophisticated south mumbai girl in this film my characters name is sakhshi she is a very calm girl and handles all her situations very calmly she can compromise everything for the person she loves the most to see him happy
8192535 it has not really sunk in for me the olympics only getting back to australia its been such a whirlwind and i am trying to enjoy everything thats happened
8192536 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8192537 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8192538 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday from different areas it became tough for us to care for the baby
8192539 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8192540 theres intentions to meet with greg and his management company yes
8192541 weve extended an invitation its just a case of confirmation as to when and where
8192542 obviously hell be getting some legal advice its just a case of when there is a stage that things have settled down i assume so were just waiting on that
8192543 its just a case of finding out what did occur
8192544 i wont be making the decision alone its a full club decision
8192545 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground
8192546 these were officers who had been working hard all day
8192547 so whats disappointing is these people are intent on fighting but innocent members of the public get caught up in it and their carnival is spoiled
8192548 oh god another film that says its an eternal love story
8192549 from 60 sites at present there should be no more than 20 in the future
8192550 we are counting among other things on people taking early retirement
8192551 the evidence received by the committee is not reflected in the interim report
8192552 it ignored the vast majority of evidence presented to the committee that cast doubt on or contradicted labors premise that fuelwatch would result in lower prices
8192553 the majority of the committee believes that a national fuelwatch scheme should be introduced
8192554 you dont play the game to reach these milestones but it was nice news to receive after the game and to surpass a great player like olivier magne is a fantastic achievement
8192555 ive got plenty of time and plenty of games ahead of me
8192556 the breakdowns an important part of the game so it will definitely be an area that we will take notice of
8192557 it can work in different ways for you you can have faster flankers in terms of reaction time at the breakdown then a bigger physical guy in terms of ball carrying ability
8192558 so it works differently for different teams and i guess it works around the way the team is coached as well
8192559 my bodys feeling really good at the moment and im enjoying the football that i am playing so hopefully if the time comes id like to make that mark
8192560 it feels like forever since we played there last and were just excited about going back there and playing we wont be thinking about last time we played there well just be thinking about this week
8192561 its the first game weve played there this year and it was almost a year ago we played there last so i dont think theres any psychological barrier there
8192562 the people that have gone in the last few weeks or this year have been fantastic for the club and theyve done their roles great and were sad to see them go
8192563 but in saying that therell be people coming into their positions and theyll be expected to do just as well
8192564 it saddens me to say even though i wasnt driving that night i cant see myself returning to the water
8192565 to my family friends everyone involved and their loved ones im sorry for the loss weve all been put through
8192566 people need to remember that there were two boats involved that night the front of the other boat hit the side of ours

8192576 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse

8192595 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8192596 not say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected

8192600 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience
8192601 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
8192602 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
8192603 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8192604 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8192605 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8192606 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures
8192607 an indian president the white racist oligarchy still wont accept it
8192608 it is an old caste that protects itself and the interests of the rich its a business truly however we have threatened the immediate recall of any judge caught in an obvious crime but it is a difficult battle
8192609 to reduce the tensions in the zones prone to social conflicts
8192610 on june 28 2007 a 20 year old u s citizen donna thi of miami was held at the airport of la paz for trying to bring into the country 500 45 caliber bullets that she had declared to customs were cheese waiting for her at the terminal was the wife of colonel james campbell the chief of the military mission of the u s embassy in bolivia u s ambassador philip goldberg immediately intervened to obtain her release saying that it was only an innocent error the ammunition he declared was to be used only for sport and show in march 2006 another u s citizen triston jay amero alias lestat claudius a 25 year old californian carrying 15 different identity documents set off 660 pounds of dynamite in two la paz hotels
8192611 today one of the methods that includes racism is separatism the attempt to delimit the lands controlled by the white race by adapting and privatizing the wealth that belongs to the nation and its people we already knew these intentions in the form of the rich districts that sought to be defined as municipalities with the goal that a share of the taxes taken by law from their immense richnesses remains under their control to increase the revenue to their split off districts behind which they sought to insulate and to use a privately controlled security apparatus to guard their privileged life styles the separatist referendum is an oligarchic racist and economic device used because they want to keep the greatest part of the wealth of santa cruz for their own benefit and because the oligarchs want moreover to prevent the government of evo morales from continuing the process of land reform and extending all over the country
8192612 let us speak about autonomy not for the oligarchy but for the people with whom we struggle these separatist groups which have just lost their privileges were for a long time in the palace they controlled the country and allowed the plundering of our country our natural resources including its natural resources and the same with the privatization of our companies and now they once again want to reestablish this system which exposes their true interest economic control
8192613 we cannot after all give succor to all the suffering of the world

8192615 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8192616 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8192617 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8192618 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8192619 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game
8192620 jen has given up on her responsibilities since she left the house shes too busy jetting around with dale

8192624 we are having great difficulties with our water system and the lines are crumbling we have limited treatment of the water we dont have bad water we have two wells but we need more treatment than what we are currently doing so we are looking forward to having clean water in war that will not cause any problems
8192625 the west virginia public service commission ruled in our favor and the city purchased the war water works from the private firm in charleston
8192626 so immediately we started to apply for grants and loans for the water system through the infrastructure council and other available sources for grants
8192627 the city is providing water to more than just the individuals who live in the corporate limits of the city
8192628 we have water service to yukon and there are some sections of war that we hope to add into the system but i think phase two covers a section of excelsior bottom and yukon that includes in phase one and phase two the replacement of storage tanks we are putting in two new storage tanks one in phase one and one in phase two those storage tanks are more than 80 years old they are in terrible condition
8192629 risk management came out and assessed the situation and determined that the tree needed to be removed
8192630 its a new program that will bring together students and their faculty mentors from a variety of colleges
8192631 when you succeed at these very competitive national level of programs its a really strong endorsement it helps to validate the interdisciplinary faculty and students we have here at ua and im very proud of what bio5 is doing to promote that type of thing
8192632 we already have an environmental health sciences program in the department of toxicology and toxicogenomics a national science foundation graduate program in evolutionary functional and computational genomics and a statistics graduate program those will provide a nice foundation
8192633 this program is designed to combine those three disciplines so we have a multi disciplinary training program
8192634 there havent been any health risks that have been shown so were just doing tests to find out whats there
8192635 for comparison to get the average recommended dose of the pharmaceutical that was most prevalent in the test a person would have to consume 1 3 million gallons of water
8192636 the source of the water that comes out of water fountains depends on where you are on campus and the current pressure of the water supplies which fluctuates
8192637 overall it averages out to be about 50 50 between water we get from tucson water and water from our own wells
8192638 the design is still in progress but were shooting for at least a silver leed rating
8192639 i think its already a great building but im glad theyre spending money to improve it
8192640 theres no specific safety concern in any of the buildings but there are a lot of things that could use some repair
8192641 there are several things that need to be done that we just havent had the money to do until now
8192642 hes a big strong athletic guy who brings speed to our offense and hes working himself into some playing time this season
8192643 hes got really good hands and hes picked up on the offense very fast
8192644 hes also not afraid to put his face in there and pass protect so hes got a well rounded game theres not a major weakness in his game
8192645 his addition to the arizona staff is an important piece in the future success of this program

8192648 we worked a lot over the summer to get to a good point to start the year off strong conceptualizing things which well actually get to in motion
8192649 i expect it to be a regular senate meeting but itll be informational
8192650 i am very impressed with the nine senators performance so far theyve all been very engaged this summer
8192651 im really excited to see them grow as a team and im excited to see them in action at their first senate meeting of the fall semester
8192652 something asua has been trying to focus in the last two years is the emphasis on the word your
8192653 we really want to focus on outreach because this is your student government
8192654 its about you the individual student and we really want to emphasize that something that we really want to be this year is approachable
8192655 we want to be a resource for the students and so i hope the students expect that from us to be able to utilize us to make the changes on campus that they want to see
8192656 theres certainly this terrible misperception that were a little anonymous
8192657 students dont know whats going on at asua and we really want the students to know that were here for them and that we do have all these amazing programs and services that are benefiting the student body
8192658 all our programs are constantly growing and setting budgets are always kind of a first step to getting a good year started
8192659 i went mainly with a black and red theme but i think guys can use dark colors and even light blues
8192660 both the windows already had blinds we threw a curtain on not for looks just to block out the sun
8192661 i threw a futon in there and made it look more like a studio house with more furniture
8192662 i had to spend 100 more just to get a lot specific thats nowhere near anything
8192663 mashups help in some cases but they are static require web development skills and are largely site centric rather than user centric

8192669 that is just completely off from what we were trying to do
8192670 intentionally and knowingly exposing genitals anus or nipple of breast while another is present who would be offended or alarmed by the act
8192671 i remember there was a gentleman who would come out on his porch and expose himself
8192672 he was clearly visible and repeated the act so we had to go and approach him
8192673 what you do will undoubtedly reflect on the ua and how are you benefiting the ua by committing some of these acts
8192674 i guess if youre comfortable with it go for it

8192676 if the current discussion paper does not get corrected well need to consider dramatically reducing the spending that we have going on this in 2009 and beyond

8192679 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character
8192680 some fluctuations in strength are possible tonight as gustave interacts with land
8192681 restrengthening is forecast to begin when the center emerges over the windward passage on wednesday
8192682 gustav represents a real and potentially dangerous storm for the entire gulf energy production region
8192683 as a precaution in case they need to evacuate or take other action
8192684 the latest odds have gone up significantly that it will track across the producing areas
8192685 what is really critical is that is natural gas country
8192686 a lot of the natural gas pulled from the gulf is off louisiana
8192687 gustav is the forerunner of what could become a very nasty hurricane season for the u s
8192688 weve got significant infrastructure and a very competent work force so we see many projects to come
8192689 weve pulled together a five year plan round each hub and are ramping up in activity were starting to see very long horizons for each of the areas
8192690 subsidence remains a concern but we managed operations safely through last winter
8192691 we have trained our crews and practiced safe evacuations as a precaution whilst safe operation is the priority there was also minimal production loss last winter due to weather
8192692 theyre new sets of eyes bringing fresh ideas from a midstream perspective
8192693 we like everyone else are trying to work with our suppliers get a little bit ahead weve got different strategies for different sectors but are trying to sort out our planning and integration of all our projects so we can go earlier to the supply chain
8192694 thats having a huge impact on the activity that everyones trying to do
8192695 what were seeing is that its putting an onus on us to plan and integrate our planning think about relationships with the supply chain a lot more
8192696 resources in its largest sense whether people drilling rigs or tubulars is a very big issue for everybody and because of the competition the price is going up all the time there are two issues one to secure the supply and the other that things are costing more
8192697 we will i hope have a couple more projects to bring to our joint ventures on valhall and ula and further drilling and gas lift to extend recovery
8192698 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8192699 im afraid gustav could potentially cause an impact similar to hurricanes katrina and rita although i certainly do not wish such things
8192700 we needed the foreign policy on the bottom of the ticket more than we want to admit
8192701 i know you have expressed an interest in creating a task force to further study and discuss these matters but i and others in the democratic caucus believe the more effective and timely course is to allow the committees of jurisdiction to roll up their sleeves and get to work on writing ethics and lobbying reform legislation that a majority of the senate can support
8192702 i concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable thank you for disabusing me of such notions
8192703 technology wise we are able to provide a vehicle that will not derail
8192704 in our experience the ttcs actions are certainly highly unusual

8192710 in the current period of increased cost control we have observed a tendency for firms to look to cut costs not just in front office functions but in middle and back office functions too
8192711 we recommend that you consider carefully any headcount reduction exercises that will affect valuation control functions at this sensitive time
8192712 the recent incidents shared a number of common characteristics in terms of the factors that contributed to the mis marking being able to continue undetected for extended periods of time
8192713 we have been unable to find any contracts or job descriptions for the socitm staff

8192717 its a thing of convenience and what i had planned on
8192718 but i might move closer to campus with some friends next year which could change things
8192719 part of the reason i wanted to live closer to campus is so i dont have to drive
8192720 yeah ill show up to class with the backpack straps on my shirt sometimes
8192721 with the hike in prices and a freer schedule i decided to move to a bike

8192729 when i heard i had more abnormal cells i thought this is the fourth time i have been told i need to have the same operation now
8192730 once you have them burnt off they should not come back but i was too scared
8192731 the doctors were doing tests for my blood loss but they seemed unclear about what it could be it was then that i was told i must have another operation on the dodgy cells on my cervix they had sent a letter to me ages ago telling that i needed to go in for an operation but i had been too scared to do anything about it
8192732 even before i was sexually active i had to have pre cancerous cells removed that nearly traumatised me for life it was so painful
8192733 i sincerely hope that the georgian people will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus
8192734 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8192735 on the grounds that they allegedly had no proper language or history or culture and so did not need a university
8192736 the newly independent georgia inflicted a vicious war on its minority nations displacing thousands of people and sowing seeds of discontent that could only grow
8192737 these were tinderboxes right on russias doorstep which russian peacekeepers strove to keep from igniting
8192738 this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8192739 they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8192740 to influence them to speak ill about zimbabwe ostensibly because of the land issue
8192741 shipments of goods paid for by zimbabwe had been seized while in some cases payment meant for procuring goods from europe and america were frozen

8192744 i would encourage every third level student in limerick and their parents to look into whether they are eligible for the third level grant a huge number of families every year miss out on some payments simply because they have not applied in time and i would hate to see any limerick families not receive payments they were due
8192745 the deadline for applications is august 29th so i would urge all parents and students to act as soon as possible even if you are not eligible for the full maintenance grant there is a sliding scale of payments and you may be entitled to something the government will also pay the cost of the student service charge up to the value of 900 such a saving is clearly worth taking a few minutes to investigate fully

8192876 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8192877 they have the human resources which is the most important
8192878 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8192879 if we are too cautious we will not move forward and ultimately risk losing our competitive edge on the other hand if there is a significant risk to health or the environment we should not rush into adopting new technologies it all depends on our assessments of the benefits and costs and on whether the risks can be managed
8192880 in cases where the impact of new technologies is relatively unknown or contested
8192881 for example when it comes to reproductive medicine and the use of stem cells

8192906 last year we finished third from bottom which was one of our worst seasons we didnt have the consistency in people turning up and a lot of us are just getting on a bit now
8192907 to be honest i thought the club might have run its course but that magic 20 year marker kept us going thinking if we could just reach that milestone then that would be a great achievement
8192908 we have basically combined their players and our players and will keep it going as trentonians we had meetings with riverside and explained why we had to maintain the identity of the club and they were totally supportive we now have a squad of about 25 26 players and they even twisted my arm to be manager for another season
8192909 we have been in the premier but never quite made it to the senior division weve now been in division one for ages but it has been a big rollercoaster ride
8192910 both riverside and ourselves had bad seasons last year but i honestly think we can finish in the top four this season obviously with trents anniversary promotion would be brilliant that would be the perfect season

8192932 the first half of 2008 has been characterised by the very challenging trading conditions in the uk us and spain
8192933 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8192934 our experience of the downturn in the us housing market has enabled us to recognise the early signs of market weakness in the uk and act swiftly to position our uk housing business for a difficult trading environment
8192935 while conditions are likely to remain tough in both the uk and the us in the short term we are maintaining momentum in the uk and we have seen pockets of stabilisation in the us

8193051 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8193052 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8193053 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8193054 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8193055 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

8193057 one of the great mistakes that we made in terms of political strategy before we broke for this latest recess was not taking on the republican party when they started talking about offshore drilling

8193063 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8193064 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8193077 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8193078 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

8193100 los biocombustibles son una alternativa pero no pueden ser exclusivamente el futuro
8193101 hay muchas otras pol ticas asociadas al tema de los biocombustibles que deben ser tratadas como por ejemplo la dependencia del transporte
8193102 teniendo en cuenta que la demanda de energ a va a incrementarse aproximadamente en un 30 en el mundo en los pr ximos a os hay muchas otras cosas que se tienen que analizar

8193106 i dont like events where there are a gazillion reporters
8193107 if you come here and david axelrod came walking down the aisle over there thered be 500 people around him and youd be getting the most boilerplate quotes so whats the point
8193108 i feel like this is the dumb state of reporting in a presidential campaign
8193109 everyone is spending time and millions of dollars to break something six hours before its announced
8193110 what do you think michelle obama thinks about hillary clinton
8193111 but the networks cant not be here which is a problem not a terrific amount of news is going to happen we have to be here in case something does happen its the same reason we send reporters down to crawford to sit there during the presidents vacation in case something does happen

8193115 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8193116 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8193117 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8193118 and we decided that we wanted to be even higher
8193119 and i said lets go sky diving stephanie was like i dont know ive never done it before
8193120 we didnt go to sleep the whole day making it very crazy and it was like 10 a m before we actually jumped and the sun was in the middle of the sky and you could see all the way across long island it was a crystal clear day and all the way to the city almost
8193121 i know all these people now theyre like were going sky diving tomorrow
8193122 its just that everything is a little bit over the top
8193123 i walk into parties sometimes and its like did they import these people did they hire these people to come to this party like the gossip girl party last weekend i walk in its their premiere party everyone is dressed the same everyone looks like theyre one of the gossip girls and it was weird because everyone looked the same
8193124 and its like this summer were like in a recession
8193125 beh a dire il vero il tuo cuore molto meno bello del mio

8193138 aol was shite but i put up with it for years because i didnt want the bother of circulating a new e mail address
8193139 i finally gave in sent out a mass e mail with my new contact info and this weird d amp d type i knew from grad school offered to set me up with an infinitely superior gmail account instead i could not bear to send out yet another mass e mail within the space of an hour i remember it was really hot that day and id just returned from a trip to vienna during which my aol account had continually failed me and i was so sweaty and jet lagged that i stuck with yahoo feeling a twinge of regret every time yet another friend switched to gmail
8193140 i dont want the hassle of informing everybody that ive changed addresses though i did leave earthlink for verizon once upon a time
8193141 in the fall i will dump verizon because all the buildings where i live have been wired by rcn and they have a terrific 99 package for phone tv cable and dsl verizon is just too damn expensive

8193160 yes the bjp mlas met me on tuesday evening the party is aware of the sentiments of the members after the gruesome killing of saraswati

8193169 we are cautious on what we put on this list
8193170 so it includes only projects where we have a piece of paper stating that we have the go ahead costain has another 1bn worth of projects where it is at the preferred bidder stage and where one to one discussions are still taking place
8193171 we are targeting blue chip clients recognising that the top 20 of clients procure 80 of all construction work in roads and in schools projects are getting larger and longer
8193172 there are fewer contractors out there and those still about need more horsepower to tackle the big projects
8193173 we have ambitious management and the plan over the next three to five year is to position costain as a top 5 contractor id currently put us in the top 10
8193174 if such a covenant breach were to occur the lenders would be able to request early repaying of all outstanding borrowings and cancel their commitments
8193175 as a result the group has entered into discussions with the lenders to agree amended terms which would assume sufficient financing based on projected trading will continue to be provided
8193176 this position indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the groups ability to continue as a going concern

8193188 san diego pride supporters and volunteers will be recognized for organizing the group event with a scoreboard welcome and the gay mens chorus of san diego will sing the national anthem
8193189 this action by the san diego padres management has greatly tarnished their record as being a family friendly organization they have truly offended the moral and religious sensibilities of literally thousands of fans i will never look at the padres the same way that i have over the past 40 plus years here in san diego enjoying its image as being pro family it is really sad

8193202 hi perhaps you would like an alternative opinion i started with swimming when i was 7 or should i say that my parents started me with swimming when i was 7 i had a heart problem and was a not very healthy child plus overweight for a year in the swimming team my hear rate improved no need to mention that my body shape got slimmer too my husband is a cycling champion of the little states of europe olympic games for 1997 malta he started with cycling when he was 12 he says it was too late to make it to the tour of france of course i am not saying that you should rase olympic champions but 4 or 5 years old is a good age to start a child with a sport it will also teach him her to some discipline self control and time planning programming apart from the benefits from the exersize i have a 3 year old daughter who comes with me to the gym she watches from the childs room while i do yoga and thai chi classes she repeats the moves and she finds them funny she takes it as a game and i can see she really enjoys herself my husband takes her with him when he goes to the tennins court and she collects the balls for him my husband now is 40 and has replaced cycling with tennis they always come grinning from left to the right ear it is good bonding experience perhaps sport is a good idea to help raising a happy child too
8193203 in fact kids are missing out being kids because grownups have taken over there are just too many organized activities for kids that are managed and controled by grownups kids no longer have the opportunity to organize control manage and direct their own activities like i did as a kid gone are the days when a bunch of kids of different ages and abilities could get together to pick and choose their own team for the day and what to play without grownups kids on their own organized negotiated selected well balanced teams and had a lot of fun otherwise no one would play so the responsibility was on the kids to develop an acceptable system that worked for everyones benefit it was simply amazing how balanced teams became of course maybe one team had more players than the other but no kid was left out we played a variety of sports and made up our own rules and guidelines to fit the terrain unfortunately the interpersonal skills developed during these activities have all been discouraged or lost today due to organize grownup interference

8193259 solar activity over the last hundred years over the last several hundred years correlates very nicely on a decadal basis with temperature well no it doesnt and of course we dont have solar records anyway but never mind
8193260 phenomenological solar signature in 400 years of reconstructed northern hemisphere temperature record
8193261 historically the co2 increases in the graphs from the last 650 000 years gas concentrations were results of temperature increases that came first
8193262 the earth has warmed some in the past century and part of that is due to human effects
8193263 there is a warming but not as dramatic as would cause you to be too alarmed
8193264 christys views and others are to be broadcast thursday in a documentary titled
8193265 christy who helped create a satellite global temperature tracking system said temperatures today in alabama are slightly cooler than in the late 19th century despite slight overall global warming
8193266 the temperature of the planet is always rising or falling
8193267 also alarmists not me ignore other sources of cooling and warming not only orbit and axial tillt but also sun
8193268 there is a warming but not as dramatic as would cause you to be too alarmed
8193269 in a 1997 hearing before the senate committee on environment and public works christy reemphasized his view that most of the rise in temperature that has occurred since the 19th century is not anthropogenic but a result of natural variability which he stated twice during a discussion at the hearing
8193270 i dont see danger i see in some cases adaptation and in others something like restrained glee at the thought of longer growing seasons warmer winters and a more fertile atmosphere
8193271 for the narrator of a documentary documentary making statements like
8193272 the reason has to do with the fact that the warmings take about 5000 years to be complete the lag is only 800 years all that the lag shows is that co2 did not cause the first 800 years of warming out of the 5000 year trend the other 4200 years of warming could in fact have been caused by co2 as far as we can tell from this ice core data
8193273 co2 temp lag lead i dont know about you but if the co2 problem now will only cause real trouble in 2807ad then ill probably not sell the gas guzzler
8193274 the cause is unknown but co2 might have contributed after the first 800 years
8193275 its rather unfounded to conclude the current global warming is due to human created co2 based on the correlations found in ice cores between t and co2 levels correct
8193276 fifty five million years ago was a time when there was no ice on the earth the antarctic was the most habitable place for mammals because it was the coolest place and the rest of the earth was rather inhabitable because it was so hot it is estimated that it was roughly 1 000 parts per million then and the important thing is that if we carry on business as usual we will hit 1 000 parts per million around the end of this century
8193277 humanity may survive thanks to some breeding couples who moved to the antarctic
8193278 the polices being pushed to prevent global warming are having a disastrous effect on the world poorest people
8193279 what i dont get is how the proponents can make a clear connection between the marginal change in c02 due to people and a future dangerous climate change when there is not a good theory of global climate dynamics

8193283 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8193284 they have the human resources which is the most important
8193285 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8193286 north korea is biding its time thinking there is no rush for denuclearisation
8193287 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues
8193288 just when we thought the six party talks where dead they keep coming back to life
8193289 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8193290 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8193291 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8193292 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8193293 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8193301 after all the rumours we have finally and quite literally unwrapped australias first surface
8193302 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8193303 they have more than enough soldiers on the ground to confront a small georgian armed force we can never match 3 000 tanks in our territory but trying to bully the west the americans this is just beyond their resources
8193304 i dont think russia first of all has the resources for world war three i dont think russia even has resources for a new cold war even as much as they might want to have
8193305 this is so shameless but it makes many things at least for the world more simple theyve posed a challenge to the world now its up to the world to tackle this challenge
8193306 im somehow reassured by good reactions from the west and generally from the world what im reassured about is that at least people see the reality now
8193307 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighborhood
8193308 this is totally up to europe if georgia is integrated more into european structures that role will widen if people get intimidated that role will be under risk
8193309 what russia clearly intended during this invasion is to control 40 percent more energy resources from central asia and the caspian basically
8193310 i think theres a future for transit in georgia i think there is a future for energy alternatives to russia its high time to look for more of these alternatives because russia doesnt make any secret of the fact that they want to bully isnt it high time to understand that staying in this energy dependency means staying in almost some mortal danger
8193311 i have twice written to the club proposing a meeting so we can try to find a constructive way forward but sadly the offer has not even been acknowledged

8193323 i really tried to emphasise here that this process up to copenhagen is a golden opportunity for african countries to make sure that the next regime does meet their needs in a much better way
8193324 they need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
8193325 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
8193326 africa is still not profiting from the instruments we have
8193327 countries have developed a better understanding here of how they want to deal with deforestation how they want to reward people for forest conservation
8193328 i think theres a strong sentiment in the room especially among developing countries that a decision to address a sector is something you decide at the national level

8193371 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8193372 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india can agree to if there were going to be changes
8193373 but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8193374 were working very hard we would like to see this agreement come into fruition because its critically important for both the united states and india
8193375 and we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nsg to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8193376 but theyre good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8193377 we are aware that the clock is ticking but it is a very important agreement for both countries and we want to see it happen
8193378 well do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns that other governments may have about the agreement
8193379 i think we have to see how this plays out its very important as i said to come to fruition on this agreement and so it wouldnt do any good for me to speculate on what may or may not happen at this point

8193396 with the growing excitement around the femto and picocell categories in wireless networking it is a great time for radioframe as we have developed a cost effective high performance solution that will deliver the promise of the technology
8193397 last year we made a big commitment to design and produce our own silicon specifically for femtocell use and that is translating into a meaningful market advantage for rfn
8193398 our omniradio tm processor gives rfn customers both a performance and cost advantage that will drive femtocell adoption across a broad market

8193408 i was under the impression he had left the club until i discovered he had another year on his contract
8193409 as far as i know nobodys made any announcements or decisions about retiring
8193410 the main thing if a guy is going back that he has the hunger for it but that goes for everybody theres no reason then why he cant go back
8193411 will i be back the key is to make sure you have the hunger if you dont you see what happened to us against kilkenny and youre not doing anyone justice or yourself justice if you dont have that hunger
8193412 you must have that hunger fellas talk about the summer but the tough time is during the winter and preparing for it and im no different maybe i have to test myself this winter to see if i have that hunger
8193413 during the summer youre not training as much you rest between games its during the winter you have the serious training guys know themselves they know if they have it or if they dont
8193414 there were certain situations we were in this year and the lads showed great character but as with all other teams if you dont win the all ireland you look back on the year as a failure thats what makes sport at this level tough

8193419 i cant say if ive been included in the andriy shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to abramovich it wasnt me
8193420 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8193421 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8193422 elfsborg were beaten 2 0 the other night but that result doesnt matter and our result against sligo rovers doesnt matter either

8193424 thursday will be a massive night at richmond park but by no means do i think well be favourites
8193425 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8193426 consumers in mature markets continued to favour mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation despite this we remain positive that mobile phone sales in 2008 will reach 1 28 billion units
8193427 we expect samsungs sales to remain strong in the second half of 2008 as new products such as the omnia pick up momentum
8193428 our confidence in an improved performance by sony ericsson weakened further as recent product announcements were disappointing since they delivered similar current features and designs
8193429 net new cellular connections declined significantly operators added more than 83 million connections in the first quarter of 2008 but they added only 75 million in the second quarter of 2008 this drop negatively impacted sales of mobile devices in the second quarter of 2008
8193430 in addition high food prices and inflation also had a negative impact on sales of replacement mobile handsets
8193431 the economy in several countries has slowed down and the region saw slower than expected replacement sales as consumers dealt with the higher cost of living despite these unfavourable conditions operators and handset vendors continue to target areas with low penetration in the commonwealth of independent states and west africa
8193432 this drop is twice as much as last quarter and it was the result of a lack of new phone features that were compelling enough to drive growth
8193433 the performance this quarter was below expectations mainly due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 and slightly weaker demand in the second quarter of 2008 generating higher levels of inventory as vendors did not fully materialise sales
8193434 despite industry concerns over the economic downturn handset sales were strong up 5 3 quarter on quarter
8193435 new subscribers were limited during the quarter as growth continued to be dominated by replacement sales
8193436 however the market was up 16 percent quarter on quarter the region reached a penetration rate of 121 5 per cent in the first half of 2008 demonstrating that there is a strong dependence on replacement sales as a driver in this market
8193437 economic conditions remained challenging during the quarter although some vendors and operators felt this more than others with sony ericsson continuing to feel the strain and vodafone sales being affected by delays in new devices availability and slower replacement sales
8193438 we expect mobile handset sales to exhibit 11 per cent growth in 2008 and the growth in revenue will be slightly lower at 9 percent as increased competition and a tougher economic environment negatively impact average selling prices in addition mobile phone manufacturers will be put under pressure to maintain healthy margins while they intend to further break through the emerging markets to increase sales

8193559 its important to be balanced mind body and spirit and if youre just thinking about kids and the house and the husband all day long youre probably not balanced
8193560 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity

8193602 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real

8193607 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8193608 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8193609 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8193610 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect
8193611 as far as research results are made public researchers can use these facilities for free
8193612 researchers will be able to study some lighter atoms that x rays cannot analyse most notably those of water
8193613 this means they could unzip the mechanism of any living organism whose main part consists of water and this will hopefully lead to further development of for example cosmetics and frozen food products

8193615 numbers have been creeping up for several years especially among young children
8193616 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
8193617 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8193618 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8193619 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8193620 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8193621 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8193622 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions

8193624 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday from different areas it became tough for us to care for the baby we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8193625 our it organization is honored by this recognition of our work in moving to electronic data capture edc for clinical trials
8193626 edc has reduced the time to access data from as much as eight weeks to real time and decreased the time to resolve queries from weeks to hours this translates to more meaningful study results
8193627 the cio 100 honors organizations that have used technology in innovative ways to generate value to the business
8193628 unlike other top lists its not just about whos biggest its about whos doing the most interesting and relevant things
8193629 dana farber has been aggressive and systematic in its migration from paper to electronic data capture for clinical trials and the organization is reaping the benefits of those efforts
8193630 we are delighted to see this recognition for such a deserving team
8193631 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8193632 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8193633 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8193634 im so proud of them all im pleased that theyre home now
8193635 im glad theyve raised enough for the hospital and the ambulance service
8193636 it has been brilliant everyone who has been involved either walking or supporting has done us proud they have gone out of their way to help
8193637 we only got lost once on the first day and that added an extra four miles on

8193642 if we dont get anyone in then well have to wait for our strikers to get fit but we have six strikers out at the moment and mark viduka obafemi martins and damien duff are all going to be out for three or four weeks were stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment
8193643 james has a three year contract with us at the moment
8193644 i dont even want to talk about losing james milner
8193645 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8193646 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8193647 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8193648 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8193659 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited

8193663 policing and justice powers are not devolved to stormont as promised
8193664 did he come away from st andrews without knowing what went on where now stands the fair deal
8193665 in the current circumstances i believe there should be a real and open public consultation on whether or not the people of northern ireland generally do indeed have adequate confidence in the stormont administration for the devolution of justice and policing to proceed
8193666 what appears to happen is that decisions are very often taken on what effectively is a system of trade off of demands between the political parties as opposed to focusing on the real merits in particular issues indeed that becomes all the more questionable when it comes to any de facto trade off of demands system of decision making what trade offs might there be when it comes to public prosecutions or policing or the running of prisons
8193667 i owe it to the people of northern ireland to see that health in all its component parts is delivered effectively and efficiently its my responsibility and ill stand or fall by it
8193668 all i can think of is that hes been given the nod
8193669 when i saw ians name down i was impressed he was coming back
8193670 ive always thought ian made his plans depending on his conversations with nick
8193671 i dont want to rely on a pick i dont want to put any pressure on nick nick is going to have enough pressure as it is without me telephoning in before a pick
8193672 i think what justin is doing is the right thing to do
8193673 ian seems the obvious pick to me and after last week darren the obvious second pick although paul may not agree
8193674 i played with darren in the first two rounds and he was special he is hitting it superbly
8193675 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8193676 there is a concrete sum which tottenham hotspur proposed and we have agreed the amount
8193677 he has done ever so well from day one he has been a leader dunny is a local lad and everyone looks up to him i gave him the responsibility of being vice captain and he has taken it on board if any player performs well whether it is dunny or anyone else then we will look to see if we can extend their contract but first and foremost we need to get the next couple of games out of the way

8193692 im trying to get positive energy from you because youre winning a lot of matches this year
8193693 it wasnt a good match but at the end of the day i won
8193694 in tennis sometimes you dont play your best tennis but you have to win the match if you can
8193695 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
8193696 a lot of things go into having the ability to win a slam
8193697 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
8193698 thats something ive learnt since i first came on the tour ive really stepped up my workload off the court and started travelling with a fitness trainer thats the big difference in my game and the reason why i have the potential to win a slam
8193699 in the past i felt nervous coming into the bigger tournaments but now that ive started to work really hard off the court i go into my matches with no excuses or worries you just go on the court and play tennis
8193700 he played really well at the start of the year and hasnt had too much success lately but as a leftie and a serve and volley player hes tricky i beat him quite comfortably in metz but i think hes playing a bit better than he was then
8193701 i had no power in my hand and couldnt hold my racket
8193702 but i have finally got my power back and the inflammation has started to calm down im just thrilled to be here and to have the opportunity to play

8193709 theres been some studies apparently by previous australian governments of this which have said it may not work we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea
8193710 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be backtracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either

8193712 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8193713 it sounded like they didnt want him to be president
8193714 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
8193715 it still feels just as good as it did the moment i crossed the finish line
8193716 its great to come back and share this with welsh athletes it helped me to know so many people were supporting me back in the village
8193717 i havent had two minutes to sit down it has been a bit overwhelming to be honest
8193718 there can be hardly anyone under 50 who can remember success here
8193719 we dont do anything in this town now but shop mansfield used to be known for its textile mills stocking factories and the brewery there used to be a pit in every village nearly all that is gone even the stags mansfield town football club have been relegated out of the football league after 77 years this has given everyone in the town a lift
8193720 she has done the town proud and it will encourage young people to get involved it is good to hear something nice being said about mansfield you should see this place on a friday or saturday night
8193721 it has definitely made us more confident and i hope it will encourage the sport we all feel inspired
8193722 not a lot of the boys were very interested but i think they are starting to take notice of it and they are getting behind sam hynd in the paralympics he is from mansfield as well
8193723 through the success of rebecca we now have a golden opportunity to inspire even more young people to go on and achieve success whether in sport or other walks of life this is what hard work can achieve
8193724 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8193725 they have the human resources which is the most important
8193726 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8193727 north korea is biding its time thinking there is no rush for denuclearisation
8193728 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues
8193729 just when we thought the six party talks where dead they keep coming back to life
8193730 it seems last night there was a build up of security forces around the camp
8193731 the police force will remain in its place until it enters the camp to collect the stockpiled weapons and prevent the rebels from getting inside the camp
8193732 the situation is very bad the people are really suffering
8193733 the first impression i have is that the sudanese want peace of course it isnt easy certain events complicate the task enormously
8193734 the government of southern darfur is asking us to organise a meeting with idp representatives to find a lasting solution but in the meantime we have been encouraging the idps to surrender their weapons voluntarily
8193735 the law recognises a difference between a true threat and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8193736 the british seem to like to laugh about their stupidity in a funny way

8193738 unfortunately the singer and jimmy page are absolutely not famous enough to be known or recognised by millions of the chinese audiences as for david beckham he was supposed to kick the football towards the red circle in the centre of the birds nest in the end just like any of his penalties at a football match he totally missed it he kicked the ball to the left and dropped in the crowd then was picked up by a lucky chinese volunteer who would not let go of the ball
8193739 i am really looking forward to the arctic voyage and have been preparing for months along with my ground crew colleagues in school one of my aims on this trip is to collect data to bring back to the school and show them how climate change is really affecting the environment
8193740 climate change is a core strand of the british councils work we are delighted that rebecca and george will be embarking on this journey and we look forward to hearing from them as the expedition progresses
8193741 cape farewell is all about increasing the understanding of the case for tackling climate change and the expedition will enable the participating schools and local communities to engage at a local level to contribute to a global issue affecting us all

8193744 it shows where i studied where i met my wife and where i organised my first exhibition 20 years ago so its really something exceptional
8193745 of course its difficult to think about yourself but its not a problem because as the person behind the works you know about the weaknesses of a project or idea not just its strengths
8193746 i wanted to dedicate this exhibition to ordinary people and not to designers and professionals this made me take a different approach
8193747 this exhibition is an opportunity to show young people that you can start to dream when you are five years old
8193748 you then have to have the patience time and also perhaps the luck to emerge professionally with projects and visions this is why i wrote such personal things in the exhibition
8193749 i didnt want to stay on the technical level i also wanted to touch visitors hearts and make them smile
8193750 my style is my way of thinking when i look back i realise that lines infinite lines are something which characterise me its as if im trying to find a graphic representation for a three dimensional product
8193751 when i was studying it was much easier to talk about how comfortable a chair was or how it was made
8193752 im happy that today we can talk much more freely about emotions and beauty this counts a lot

8193754 damit soll der internetprovider zum netzpolizisten und zur zensurbeh rde gemacht werden was jedem vern nftigen rechtsempfinden widerspricht
8193755 ein internet service provider hat weder das recht noch die m glichkeit zu berpr fen welche daten von seinen kunden im internet abgerufen oder zur verf gung gestellt werden
8193756 auch eine solche ma nahme w rde nur mit den mitteln eines totalit ren berwachungsstaates m glich sein und die b rgerlichen grundrechte massiv untergraben
8193757 internetprovider sind f r die inhalte von drittanbietern nicht selbst verantwortlich
8193758 es muss bei dieser frage klar zwischen access und host providern unterschieden werden letztgenannte haben datenschutzrechtlich gar keine m glichkeit konkrete webinhalte einzusehen da sie lediglich eine durchleitungsaufgabe wahrnehmen

8193767 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

8193772 is to develop a universal mathematical transformation of the data that would work well for everyone not just for a specific individual

8193774 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8193775 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8193776 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8193777 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8193778 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8193779 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8193780 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8193781 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8193782 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8193783 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8193784 there is a perception that it is sometimes easier for motorcyclists to evade detection of offences because of the speed they travel at
8193785 we feel that signs warning of the likelihood of detection by air will be an extra incentive for particularly motorcyclists but all motorists to drive safely and help us to reduce accidents further
8193786 essex police is keen to use and develop ideas and strategies that look to address and enhance driver and rider behaviour in an effort to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads
8193787 we will embrace any idea or strategy that supports that cause
8193788 use of the force helicopter will enable officers to obtain video evidence of offences including excess speed
8193789 it will also support specific road safety operations providing information and intelligence to officers on the ground in addition to the helicopters ability to disrupt and detect travelling criminals

8193793 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8193794 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it

8193804 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8193805 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8193806 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8193807 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8193808 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8193809 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8193810 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8193811 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8193812 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8193813 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8193814 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8193815 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8193816 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8193817 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8193818 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8193819 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8193820 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8193821 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8193822 if there was some other news to cover we wouldnt talk about disunity in the democratic party
8193823 the numbers tell a different story from the hype and theatre around the convention
8193824 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8193825 we can confirm that we are urgently investigating this report
8193826 i was appalled when i found the bank account information that sort of thing shouldnt have been listed on there
8193827 we were informed yesterday that another computer appears to have been bought on ebay and contains the personal details of what sounds like thousands of people we are investigating
8193828 well let you know if we can use your services
8193829 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8193830 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8193831 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8193832 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8193833 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8193834 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8193835 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8193836 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8193837 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8193838 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8193839 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8193840 i realised that seddon would have a digger suitable for clearing the land on eskdale drive as they were demolishing the welcome inn this week
8193841 seddon generously lent the digger for a day to start clearing the debris creating the communal garden and allotment will provide new skills and relaxation for residents as well as fresh home grown vegetables
8193842 its good that the land is being cleaned up as it was a waste to leave it overgrown the garden is a great idea to give somewhere for the kids to play
8193843 older and younger people will enjoy the land being cleaned up and i hope more people come to the meetings to have their say
8193844 we are only too happy to help the residents create a green space that will improve their quality of life it just goes to show that we are not just about bricks and mortar but also with bowlee park housing supporting the langley community
8193845 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8193846 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8193847 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8193848 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8193849 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8193850 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8193851 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8193852 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8193853 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8193854 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8193855 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8193856 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8193857 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8193858 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8193859 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8193860 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8193861 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8193862 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8193863 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8193864 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8193865 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8193866 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8193867 model that we saw with microsoft windows and office a game where network effects drive a winner takes all marketplace or the cooperating applications come together to build value greater than any of the pieces do alone
8193868 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8193869 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8193870 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8193871 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8193872 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8193873 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8193874 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8193875 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8193876 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8193877 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8193878 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8193879 well certainly be looking very favourably at extending bretts contract because the club has improved tremendously and we think theres more improvement to come
8193880 i think it would be great if both of them kicked a hundred
8193881 we could play six blokes behind the ball and have this dull affair but at the end of the day it would be fantastic to have this scenario played out
8193882 its rare for two players to achieve 100 goals in the same round let alone at the same venue and it would be great to see not only for our supporters but all footy supporters in general
8193883 i dare say a few of us will have the blinkers on going inside the forward 50
8193884 id be a little bit disappointed if players are out on their own and their going to a real 50 50 contest
8193885 i think we need to get the score on the board and you dont want to deflate other players because youre trying to get fevola that 100th goal
8193886 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8193887 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8193888 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8193889 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8193890 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8193891 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8193892 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8193893 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8193894 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8193895 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8193896 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8193897 as an irish bookmaker we did not do well out of the golf
8193898 its no longer just about the 4 30pm at kempton
8193899 we offer more novelty bets than any other bookmaker and the novelty market is growing substantially year on year
8193900 novelty bets are also about customer acquisition we get people online to look at the odds in novelty market and then get them to make more mainstream bets
8193901 research shows us that players with a shop nearby and access to online spend disproportionately more than those with just online
8193902 at a time when customers are facing the price of food and petrol we are determined to cut prices substantially for all stand out events of the summer
8193903 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8193904 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8193905 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8193906 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8193907 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8193908 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8193909 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8193910 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8193911 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8193912 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8193913 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8193914 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8193915 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8193916 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8193917 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8193918 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8193919 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8193920 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8193921 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8193922 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8193923 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8193924 i think that to get good information you need a little contention
8193925 they see how nice the town looks and they want to lock the door and not let anyone else in
8193926 the board will be objective in meeting the needs of both the old and new residents as this town belongs to everyone that calls ancram their home
8193927 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8193928 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges
8193929 were going as quickly as we can and the town is not facing emergency services being cut or anything like that

8193931 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8193932 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8193933 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8193934 that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was
8193935 what is your vision for the visual arts in san diego
8193936 we now have offices on both the east and west ap financial inc
8193937 this is from the historic rockin dogs san marcos sessions featuring the earlier lineup of sam

8193942 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8193943 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8193944 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8193945 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8193946 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8193947 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8193948 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8193949 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8193950 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8193951 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8193952 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8193953 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8193954 that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was

8193958 when i put the recycling out this morning the neighbourhood dumpster driver was waiting in his land rover
8193959 did you see john mayer on tmz i cant believe he pc broke up with jen
8193960 i was just thinking about that date with tony and i got a bit of naus talgia
8193961 the new lv bag is 4 g but its totally risickulous
8193962 i went to that new spa down the street and they gave me a freaking gaza strip
8193963 we now have equipment up at the wabash valley college radio tower in mt carmel at bellmont allendale keensburg and at mesa lake
8193964 when i put the recycling out this morning the neighbourhood dumpster driver was waiting in his land rover
8193965 did you see john mayer on tmz i cant believe he pc broke up with jen
8193966 i was just thinking about that date with tony and i got a bit of naus talgia
8193967 the new lv bag is 4 g but its totally risickulous
8193968 i went to that new spa down the street and they gave me a freaking gaza strip
8193969 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8193970 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8193971 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8193972 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8193973 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8193974 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8193975 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8193976 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8193977 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8193978 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8193979 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8193980 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8193981 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8193982 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8193983 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8193984 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8193985 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8193986 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8193987 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8193988 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8193989 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8193990 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8193991 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8193992 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8193993 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8193994 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8193995 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8193996 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8193997 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8193998 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8193999 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming

8194002 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8194003 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
8194004 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us

8194072 every one agrees that the current space at the st johns co cathedral museum urgently needs to be improved both in terms of its physical extent and the quality of the museum environment
8194073 for the ka the primary guiding principle should be the protection of the integrity of st
8194074 if the extension project proposed by the foundation is found to pose unreasonable risks as identified through an eia then it stands to reason that we have to look for additional space elsewhere no one neither the foundation nor its critics may rule out a priori any option at this stage this should be the attitude taken by all reasonable people who want to protect our national heritage
8194075 furthermore a close working collaboration between the cathedrals foundation and the valletta rehabilitation committee will be essential to ensure the long term sustainability of any proposals
8194076 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground
8194077 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8194078 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8194079 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history
8194080 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8194081 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8194082 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history
8194083 its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture
8194084 despite current falling property prices in the vast majority of cases retired homeowners have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes over a number of years
8194085 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8194086 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8194087 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8194088 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8194089 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8194090 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8194117 the people of crawford county have a right to believe in the memorandum of understating that set this land aside for economic development
8194118 i believe with a double digit poverty rate unemployment approaching double digits nearly 70 percent of our land being state owned we need economic development here
8194119 we need money we need the jobs and we need the hope that a project like this gives us
8194120 what im against is selling public land for a project based on fantasy
8194121 the problem with roberson is if he cant validate it its not true

8194130 ich bin eine stolze demokratin eine stolze amerikanerin und eine stolze unterst tzerin von barack obama
8194131 das sind die gr nde warum ich um die pr sidentschaft gek mpft habe und das sind die gr nde warum ich barack unterst tze
8194132 ich m chte dass ihr euch selbst fragt habt ihr euch nur meinetwegen im wahlkampf engagiert
8194133 in a service business management commitment and backing of a deal is very important the management is fully backing our proposal
8194134 what will happen i dont know we will wait and see but i think we are better positioned because of all this
8194135 there is still a lot of negative news coming from the environment but there is no dearth of opportunity
8194136 the exercise in mumbai will last two days and john will then leave for new delhi where something similar is planned calcutta is going to be the coachs last stop
8194137 mendis reminds me a bit of johnny gleeson though he releases the ball much quicker is taller and stronger he also has good change of pace
8194138 i dont know the reason why they failed against mendis as far as warne was concerned over a period of time people read him more but warnes ability stood the test of time like any great batsman or bowler its a testing time for him mendis his action has not been studied in detail he has not been exposed enough
8194139 this is pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
8194140 the urgency to act has never been greater especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
8194141 poverty has fallen by about 1 per year since 1981
8194142 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts
8194143 detectives have interviewed more than 50 of the passengers and hope to finish speaking to all of them by the end of the week
8194144 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8194145 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8194146 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8194147 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8194148 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8194149 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward

8194155 ik ben niet echt tevreden met de manier waarop ik gespeeld heb
8194156 het is nooit makkelijk om het tegen een andere fran aise op te nemen tegen de estse kaia kanepi zal ik mijn niveau toch moeten opkrikken
8194157 daar ben ik wel blij om ik wilde kost wat kost niet tweemaal op rij van dezelfde speelster verliezen
8194158 het veld ligt vrij open niemand domineert het spel zoals dat vroeger het geval was daardoor mag ik opnieuw hoop koesteren om mee te spelen voor de grote prijzen nummer n worden is niet langer mijn doel daarvoor moet je veel spelen en dat doe ik niet meer de grand slams zijn veel belangrijker voor me

8194161 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8194162 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8194163 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8194164 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8194165 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8194166 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8194167 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8194168 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8194169 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8194170 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8194171 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8194172 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8194173 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8194174 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8194175 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8194176 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8194177 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8194178 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8194179 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8194180 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8194181 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8194182 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8194183 no existe un acuerdo de fondo entre los espa oles en torno a c mo ver este periodo de la historia de espa a

8194186 bob said we dont drink and drive but we smoke and fly
8194187 niet alleen door het klimaat en de natuur maar ook vanwege de muziek en de mensen ze laten zich niet zo gemakkelijk opjagen als in het rijke westen voor rastas begint de hemel al op aarde voor mij is dat jamaica
8194188 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8194189 the only reason i came by is to tell you that i love you
8194190 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
8194191 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
8194192 im honored to stand before you tonight as gov caseys son and a proud supporter of barack obama
8194193 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8194194 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8194195 because as pennsylvanians know joe biden is one of us and barack obama is one of us too
8194196 and if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8194197 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for the oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8194198 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8194199 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8194200 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaeda and press russia to live up to its obligations
8194201 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries
8194202 but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but rather because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8194203 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8194204 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8194205 do we treat teenagers like animals in heat or like people with a brain that have the ability to control themselves
8194206 we believe human beings can control their sexual desires and should be encouraged to
8194207 there has been a groundswell of opposition to these programs from states across the country and we thought we had put the issue to rest here in pennsylvania too
8194208 we are just trying to be fair across the board and make sure everyone has access to the funding they need
8194209 wallfit signifies highest indoor environment quality as well as stability of value a solid built house in combination with a shortened time of construction and a cheaper construction of a prefabricated house
8194210 within just one week the solid wallfit prefabricated house is built and after another one to two weeks already ready to flooring and covering
8194211 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8194212 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8194213 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8194214 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8194215 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8194216 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8194217 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8194218 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8194219 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8194220 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8194221 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8194222 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8194223 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8194224 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8194225 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8194226 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8194227 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8194228 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8194229 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8194230 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8194231 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8194232 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8194233 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8194234 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8194235 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8194236 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8194237 it would be held more or less around the same time the champions trophy was supposed to take place
8194238 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 that he stiffed the city
8194239 if you look at the speakers the vast majority come from the 18 battleground states
8194240 these conventions are about trying to get swing states to move and winning on nov 4 theres nothing else at stake here zero
8194241 look at the seating arrangements on the convention floor same thing its not that complicated its not about individuals its about winning the key states thats what all of us want
8194242 i think its an important foundation state new jersey new york california these are the places that need to be strong
8194243 our basic obligation is to do our jobs to make sure barack doesnt have any problems in our state
8194244 i think the only lingering element of disunity is that the republicans are trying to take a fairly small slice of disappointment and turn it into a major issue
8194245 cho k man meru e lodda genadan balgater borani o baz jagaha gorani chrah jah ent cherag dega saman e ae labz charah ja ent lod goshan zahma sward bor goshan asp a horse ae batal e postha ek event e ast k ha gon balgater o kasho ker e handani meer meru e sosti o kaheli e sara ant hame ranaga dega batal e ast k

8194247 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8194248 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8194249 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8194250 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8194251 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8194252 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8194253 i believe it does you really dont know what to believe
8194254 in her speech tonight shes under pressure to heal the party concede defeat rally the troops beat up a little bit on john mccain do it all with style good humor and grace
8194255 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8194256 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8194257 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8194258 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8194259 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something
8194260 but i dont think anybody is distraught that ed rendell has compared sen obama to adlai stevenson
8194261 im just here to cover the most important state in the union pennsylvanias going to decide the election
8194262 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8194263 meanwhile exxon had the largest quarterly profit in the history of the world
8194264 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8194265 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8194266 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite

8194288 we hebben alles gedaan om tot een akkoord te komen maar dat is niet gelukt omdat er bij verschillende partners niet de wil was om tot een besluit te komen we moeten het dossier nu afronden voor de beleidsverklaring op 14 oktober er is een akkoord dat gerespecteerd moet worden en er zijn humanitaire noodgevallen
8194289 we zijn er niet ver van verwijderd het is een kwestie van goede wil
8194290 al die dossiers moeten deel uitmaken van een globaal akkoord dat we strenger zouden zijn staat in het regeerakkoord maar ik denk niet dat elke keer terugkomen op bijkomende voorwaarden de manier is om het klimaat te verbeteren
8194291 we beginnen er in dit land aan gewoon te raken te leven met het zwaard van damocles boven ons hoofd als we iedere keer afhankelijk zouden zijn van de beslissingen van de nv a en met gekruiste armen wachten zou dit dramatisch zijn voor het bestuur van het land
8194292 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8194293 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8194294 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8194295 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8194296 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8194297 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8194298 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8194299 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8194300 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8194301 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8194302 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8194303 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8194304 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8194305 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8194306 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8194307 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8194308 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8194309 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8194310 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8194311 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8194312 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8194313 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator

8194316 in the first six months of 2008 we reported healthy growth in revenue and profitability despite a weakening global economy
8194317 with a slowing global economy high commodity prices and policies by the chinese government towards the export manufacturing sector we are beginning to feel the impact on our customers businesses as well as on our own
8194318 despite the impact the current climate is having on gold supplier members in our international marketplace our china marketplace grew very quickly in the first half of 2008 this growth is a result of efforts taken over the past few years to expand the network effect of our marketplace and maintain high customer satisfaction levels which are bearing fruit in the face of a strong domestic economy going forward we expect the robust growth of our china marketplace to continue the recent launches of a series of new products and services including winport china trustpass for individuals and export to china will further expand our china marketplace and we are encouraged by the positive response these initiatives have received so far
8194319 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8194320 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8194321 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8194322 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8194323 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8194324 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8194325 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8194326 wellicht reageren zij anders op het vaccin dan de 15 tot 26 jarige vrouwen bij wie het vaccin wel is getest

8194330 trotz schwieriger marktbedingungen haben wir ein zufriedenstellendes ergebnis erreicht es ist ein kompliment an die kompetenz der sparkassenberater deren empfehlungen die kunden offensichtlich sch tzen und an die qualit t unserer produkte
8194331 diese finanzmarktkrise ist zwar noch nicht abgehakt die dekabank hat sie allerdings hinter sich gelassen das zeigt unser gesch ftsmodell greift und ist selbst in krisenzeiten robust und in der lage sich nachhaltig weiter zu entwickeln
8194332 auf den ersten blick ist das sicherlich ein markanter einschnitt aber im vergleich zu der zeit vor den beiden rekordjahren 2006 und 2007 ein trend zur normalit t mit eher marktkonformen und risikoadjustierten preisen vor allem in den weniger etablierten lagen und m rkten
8194333 die banken gehen bei der kreditvergabe deutlich selektiver und restriktiver hinsichtlich des rendite risiko profil der zu finanzierenden objekte vor was mit den stark verteuerten krediten einher geht
8194334 daneben registrieren wir auch eigenkapitalstarke ausl ndische investoren die deutschland nach wie vor in ihrem anlagefokus haben entsprechend verzeichnen wir in diesem immobilienmarktsegment weiterhin stabile spitzenrenditen
8194335 dagegen werden sich unserer meinung nach top objekte mit geringem leerstand und bonit tsstarken mietern in sehr guten innerst dtischen lagen behaupten k nnen und ohne preisabschl ge zu vermarkten sein vor allem auch deshalb weil zum einen die mietpreise f r erstklassige b rofl chen in den deutschen toplagen im europ ischen vergleich auf weit unterdurchschnittlichem niveau stabil sind so liegt die deutsche finanzmetropole frankfurt mit einer spitzenmiete von aktuell 39 00 euro pro quadratmeter monatlich auf dem 15 platz im cbre mietpreisranking f r b rozentren in der emea region und damit weit hinter dem londoner west end 136 10 euro pro quadratmeter monatlich moskau 89 96 euro pro quadratmeter monatlich paris 64 33 euro pro quadratmeter monatlich oder z rich 49 26 euro pro quadratmeter monatlich zum anderen werden weiterhin die hochqualitativen fl chen in top lagen von international t tigen unternehmen rege nachgefragt
8194336 die eigentliche immobilienbewirtschaftung spielt gerade in einem schwierigeren finanzmarkt und einem tendenziell abk hlenden makro konomischen umfeld eine noch gr ere rolle so wird es f r die bestandshalter in den kommenden monaten noch entscheidender sein welche positiven beitr ge aus dem eigenen asset management durch mieterh hungen bzw leerstandssenkungen generiert werden k nnen
8194337 das ist f r uns studenten die sich sp ter vielleicht einmal selbstst ndig machen wollen eine wichtige informationsquelle wir fragen die unternehmer wie sie die geworden sind die sie heute sind es geht uns um haltungen und einstellungen weniger um konkrete tipps
8194338 gib in der krise niemals auf und heb nicht ab wenn du erfolg hast
8194339 this is the first time all 27 buddhist orders have held a rally
8194340 this government is trying to evangelise the whole country and turn it into a protestant state
8194341 they have the human resources which is the most important
8194342 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8194343 north korea is biding its time thinking there is no rush for denuclearisation
8194344 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues
8194345 i had planned the entire shoot schedule with dates locations and artistes dates before going on floor everything has gone as per the plan in fact we were a little apprehensive for our schedule in kashmir but shrinagar and pehelgaon shoots were very smooth and peaceful it went on the dot and everybody had great time in fact hazi ali shoot had to be postponed a bit because of the heavy rains and permission problems finally we will go 100 into post production
8194346 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8194347 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8194348 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8194349 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8194350 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8194351 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8194352 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8194353 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

8194355 officials and institutions are given powers but there is an inherent danger to these powers to be abused and misused there is a need for coordination of strategies and the need for research
8194356 every single advance for gay rights has come at the state level
8194357 go back and support those pro gay state legislators and eliminate the anti gay state legislators
8194358 just a little bit of money goes a long way
8194359 the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
8194360 i havent even fully advertised them but i have had a lot of interest from local schools and even mothers at plunket groups
8194361 little girls see their mum having these treatments done and want to have the same
8194362 just a little bit of lip gloss and eye shadow and they think its the real deal
8194363 sit back and relax while our therapists pamper the girls from head to toe
8194364 a pamper party is once in a blue moon they are not putting makeup on every day
8194365 i dont see any harm in it and other parents shouldnt be worried
8194366 its not all about getting done up its just about having fun
8194367 if you truly want something let it go if it comes back then its yours if it doesnt then it was never yours to begin with
8194368 i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion

8194380 people are scared about the future you know something about this in this facility
8194381 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through
8194382 if people tell you we cant afford it remember that were spending 10 billion a month on iraq
8194383 we need u s taxpayer money rebuilding america and putting people back to work
8194384 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
8194385 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
8194386 it seems to me that hes zeroing in on the common people and the people who need help the most
8194387 they say we should have health insurance they say this every four years and i dont see anything being done
8194388 a lot of the fall in the uninsured is due to the increase in public health care coverage
8194389 there needs to be some federal solution at some point in time its just so costly it cant go on forever
8194390 most people get it that were one or two paychecks away from not having health care if we lose our jobs that health insurance we take as a given becomes very problematic
8194391 both presidential candidates are saying we can no longer avoid this discussion it has to be on the front burner
8194392 the plans are so different youd have to work really hard to find common ground
8194393 when it comes down to what kind of choices to make the country divides pretty much on party lines
8194394 thanks to the new young chefs paris is reclaiming its title as food capital of the world
8194395 people need to know that the buck stops with them they cant shuffle off the responsibility

8194397 there will again be a less spare capacity from 2013 meaning oil prices are not likely to return to levels from a few years ago any time soon
8194398 non opec output is expected to peak by the middle of the next decade production will be increasingly dominated by a small number of major producers
8194399 unless government policy changes world energy demand will grow by 55 percent by 2030 despite all the attention given to wind bio solar the reality is we are still heading for a fossil future 84 percent of the overall increase will come from oil gas and coal

8194431 the restaurant campaign we are launching is not only an awareness drive but it also serves to assure consumers that the rice they are eating is free from these risky organisms

8194442 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8194443 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8194444 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8194445 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8194446 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8194447 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8194448 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8194449 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8194450 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8194451 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8194452 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8194453 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8194454 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8194455 they have the human resources which is the most important
8194456 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running

8194458 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues

8194465 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8194466 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched

8194472 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8194473 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much

8194477 parkinsons is a costly disease and places a huge burden on carers and society as a whole we need governments to realise that taking action to reduce this burden by ensuring people receive the best care and treatment available makes the most economic and social sense
8194478 there are nearly 1 2 million people living with parkinsons in europe and with an ageing population this figure is set to rise its time to address inequalities in care and treatment of the disease and improve the lives of those affected by parkinsons now and in the future
8194479 it always amazes me how parkinsons is so visible socially and yet seemingly invisible to society this is a ruthless condition and help is needed throughout europe this epda initiative is crucial we need to increase understanding we need to raise the profile we need people not just to see but to act

8194489 if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8194490 they had a goal disallowed and they missed a penalty and we did not create any chances they are well organised they have good players and they have quality if you talk about the other teams we have faced in champions league qualifiers in the last years then they are the best
8194491 i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money
8194492 we will give it our best but if we somehow manage to make it through it will be the biggest shock by a belgian side in 40 years all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night they were top with maximum points
8194493 sometimes you need a kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege
8194494 you dont want to go into the season a little complacent and no one could argue with the fact that liege were the better side on the night
8194495 we have maximum points from the first two games and still havent played anywhere near the level we are capable of we know we can improve but at least we kept going to the end against middlesbrough and showed great character

8194510 the differences we have are ones we can solve and in the next two or three days there has to be a solution because there is no more time
8194511 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league
8194512 it would be a disaster not to get through but nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
8194513 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8194514 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better i am confident we will play much much better li ge were good in the first leg but we were really poor if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8194515 i am aware of the financial implications money is always important in football
8194516 the economy has enough traction it is resilient definitely there is no loss of momentum

8194523 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8194524 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals

8194540 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8194541 the government is selling lands is it justified we are selling future of our country
8194542 nowhere in the country so many sezs are coming up as in this state acquiring lands of poor and cultivable lands for sezs is unjustified we are against it

8194548 i could see that clinton might have endorsed him obama has a lot of attributes he values
8194549 one must learn by doing the thing for though you think you know it you have no certainty until you try
8194550 ik denk dat dat komt omdat we meer weten we hebben ervaring opgedaan
8194551 mannen zijn klootzakken je kunt ze niet vertrouwen ze zijn veel kwaadaardiger dan vrouwen
8194552 ik heb nooit zo dun willen zijn en ik heb nooit anorexia gehad

8194555 since banyan started in 1979 we have had flying clubs gather at banyan before departing to the islands we love sharing how easy it is to fly to the bahamas and to provide the information documentation and products those pilots need
8194556 doe is not just a bunch of ph d s
8194557 engineering is quite valuable to doe we have 18 labs across the us which includes oak ridge national laboratory and much of what we use in our research cannot be bought off the shelf it needs to be engineered by multi disciplined teams
8194558 but doe wants to get into the brass tacks where students can contribute to something of concern to them and see some change come from their effort
8194559 quite honestly aviation was first to the plate we also knew that aviation would be a subject that would really excite the kids
8194560 ptc shares the concerns its clients have with the decline in us k 12 stem science technology engineering and mathematics education and the very real workforce crisis that threatens us aerospace competitiveness and national security
8194561 build a plane and faa were key players in developing and promoting an aviation themed program to doe
8194562 not surprisingly they want engineers with superb academic credentials and 7 10 years of real world experience the engineering pipeline shortage is now especially amongst us citizens so we talked about the concept of us students getting real world experience during their k 12 education and they were very supportive
8194563 thank you for writing to inquire about receiving pbs hd in your area im sorry for any frustration this causes you and im happy to respond to your e mail
8194564 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer
8194565 as mentioned in our previous e mail we are launching new satellites to increase the number of hd channels that we are able to offer it is possible that pbs hd may become available at that time however i wouldnt want to speculate on any dates for this or our service provided by other companies

8194568 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8194569 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8194570 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8194571 it continues to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons and retains the option to test nuclear weapons again in the future under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
8194572 the unique collaboration between the university of sheffield and the british library and generously funded by the ahrc has helped to re evaluate the golden period of british theatre between 1945 and 1968

8194574 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8194575 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8194576 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8194577 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8194578 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8194579 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8194580 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8194581 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8194582 with the exception of the balloonists everyone in the upstate sc area is thrilled to see the arrival of serious rain
8194583 the area has been in a drought for more than a year and rain levels this year alone are almost 12 inches below normal
8194584 these accidents have all involved aircraft operating under instrument flight rules and in contact with air traffic controllers
8194585 investigations show that pilots were either not advised about areas of severe weather ahead or were given incomplete information each pilot had readily available alternatives that if utilized would have likely prevented the accident
8194586 the primary job of atc is to keep ifr aircraft separated when their workload permits controllers are also required to provide additional services such as weather advisories and upon pilot request suggested headings to avoid radar displayed precipitation
8194587 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds

8194592 i dont decide that but ill look into it for you
8194593 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8194594 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8194595 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8194596 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

8194599 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8194600 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8194601 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8194602 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8194603 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8194604 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8194605 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8194606 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8194607 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8194608 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8194609 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8194610 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8194611 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8194612 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8194613 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8194614 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8194615 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8194616 weel there is nothin muchto say i went to the loo and when i

8194621 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8194622 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8194623 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8194624 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8194625 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8194626 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8194627 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8194628 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines

8194632 not just as a defense but as a whole team we got started late last season and we just want to start it off right this year
8194633 we didnt play as well in the kicking game and taking care of the football and tackling a very fine back and ucla certainly has a very fine back

8194644 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish

8194651 the fact that we finished as the minor premiers has provided us with a really good opportunity to earn back some of that money through bar sales and the canteen
8194652 our canteen provides a big component of the clubs finances and it was really encouraging to see the effort that took place back in order get it back into shape
8194653 but while we certainly enjoy the benefits of having an insurance policy it doesnt address some of the intangible things like trophies and historical photos
8194654 about a week after the major break ins some juniors heading to training one afternoon saw a group coming away with pocketfuls of gatorade they had broken another door to get into the club so there is still that sort of nuisance stuff

8194658 if we can unite as a community we are far from powerless against a small minority of young people causing so much trouble in our town with their antisocial behaviour
8194659 when i grew up around here everyone looked out for everyone and there was less crime simply because people respected each other
8194660 the fact that three indigenous people spoke at the meeting made me feel that everyone in town was united and facing the same problems and that everyone was keen to work together to find solutions
8194661 i really think we have a group of marginalised young people in town but they need a sense of belonging and a lot of them arent getting that
8194662 there have been a lot of people congratulating me and everyone has been really nice but i still dont feel like i have come out of that olympic bubble
8194663 i couldnt sleep on the plane because i was thinking about coming back home
8194664 i keep saying to people that i didnt expect it the silver medal but the race was what i was expecting it was just the result that was better than i expected
8194665 ive been trying to work out what it means i think it will have quite a good impact on the sport as a whole because the last medal we won was back in 1992 with danielle woodward
8194666 weve tried to market ourselves as the three of us to sponsors as one of us is going to succeed at something
8194667 when we purchased here in 2002 all the checks were made and there was no indication any industrial activity would be carried on in the area at any time in the future
8194668 my family have been in the kyogle area for generations when they took the chains off my forebears thats where they settled
8194669 the main argument we have is that kyogle council did not notify us do councils discriminate because were not in their area were not on their data system so we have been ignored we feel like weve been highjacked here
8194670 there are always positives and negatives with these types of industries it seems a worthwhile resource in a fairly central location
8194671 when i learnt to fly we took so many risks
8194672 we lost at least one during each training course i was on today the system of air safety is so different
8194673 this district has more recreational aircraft than almost any other in australia
8194674 but most of our airstrips are single runways with no cross strip to handle crosswinds
8194675 many times ive had to fly over ballina and go to brisbane because of strong south easterly winds on the ground

8194781 not long after wed begun dating anneli unexpectedly showed up on the set of a short film i was making the scene we were shooting was how can i put it a little bit crude ive dated girls that have been kind of uptight about stuff i think is hysterical so after the scene was over i didnt know what to expect i was relieved and kind of surprised to see that it made her laugh in fact she was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her face and she could barely breathe thats when i knew i had a good one two months later i proposed
8194782 choosing someone who is not rigid and who can let go with a good belly laugh especially over the same things you find funny is a win win situation
8194783 i knew marianne was the one when she encouraged me to work through a tough situation i was having with a co worker she allowed me to vent but also challenged me to see things from another perspective and not take the easy way out and ignore the situation which was my impulse because of her influence i was able to approach my co worker and get a better understanding of where he was coming from after that i knew marianne would never be someone who walked behind me but someone who would always stand next to me
8194784 anyone who encourages you to face a challenge is more likely to be a consistent predictable partner and one who realizes that unless you grow you both get held back
8194785 she allows me to pursue my passion even though it takes time away from her
8194786 i knew marnie was a cool girl when she never gave me grief about being a surfer that was a big deal because my previous girlfriend was always mad when i went surfing instead of spending every nanosecond with her the clincher once marnie drove eight hours with me from atlanta to florida just so i could get in the water after that how could i not fall for her even now shes still ok with me taking off to the beach every weekend she lets me do my thing because she knows it keeps me centered and happy i dont know many guys or any surfers that get away with that

8194790 gold remains hesitant and is not getting clear direction from the dollar which is essentially flat
8194791 higher oil prices and weakness in equity markets should result in gold remaining well bid as this market session progresses but given the degree of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty anything can happen in these markets in the short term

8194818 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
8194819 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8194820 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
8194821 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
8194822 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8194823 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8194824 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8194825 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8194826 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change

8194850 the greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket indeed in the history of all ball games
8194851 my grip was different and it assisted me for on side shots though it handicapped me playing between mid off and point i experimented with it but decided not to change throughout a long career my grip caused many arguments but i think it is sufficient to prove that any young player should be allowed to develop his own natural style providing he is not revealing any obvious error a player is not necessarily wrong because he is different

8194853 there are two teams out there on the oval one is playing cricket the other is not
8194854 history may decide whether it was the greatest team ever i cant

8194856 practically without exception every ball went where it was intended to go any artist must surely aim at perfection and that is why i think lords 1930 is my first choice as my finest innings
8194857 in a long career there are many outstanding memories but i suppose the opening day of the third test at leeds must rank as the greatest in my cricketing life to do so against australias oldest and strongest rival was satisfying

8194883 the size reduction in the hippocampus seems to occur sometime after the initial exposure to stress or trauma in childhood strengthening the argument that it has something to do with ptsd itself or the stress exposure
8194884 said dawson hedges a byu neuroscientist and an author on the study
8194885 most people exposed to traumatic events do not develop ptsd
8194886 however those that do may show certain changes in their brains
8194887 the big question about which came first much like the chicken and the egg has persisted
8194888 we found childrens hippocampi were intact after the onset of abuse but somehow there was shrinkage in the group that had reached adulthood

8194890 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness

8194892 the management board of gfk announces that it has terminated all discussions in relation to financing for a possible offer and that gfk will therefore not be pursuing an offer for tns
8194893 the board after careful consideration has concluded that the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns that was also economically in the best interests of the gfk shareholders
8194894 tns continues to recommend that tns shareholders reject the offer announced by wpp
8194895 the first half of 2008 has been characterised by the very challenging trading conditions in the uk us and spain
8194896 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8194897 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent these amendments being finalised by the end of this year

8194913 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8194914 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8194915 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate

8194917 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8194918 it is also our intention that we should not be a burden on our canadian friends and allies or the rest of the international community forever
8194919 there are communities who do not believe in immunization sometimes its for religious reasons they choose not to immunize themselves or their children and theyre very susceptible to infections when they come around
8194920 normally youre not even aware of whos immunized until there is an outbreak and then its very clear where these pockets of unimmunized people are living
8194921 what we are not seeing outside of those communities is a chain of transmission
8194922 if we saw sustained transmission not just the sporadic cases
8194923 dr patrick said diseases like mumps have become so rare that parents often dont think their children need vaccines
8194924 its a bit of a circular thing if you succeed with a vaccine people dont see the vaccine around for a while and they think we dont need it
8194925 there needs to be a responsibility that if you are in a susceptible phase of having the illness you dont spread it to someone else you do stay at home and i think that should be societys expectation of people whore going to take a risk that way
8194926 i really dont have a comment on any of that
8194927 everyone is making it out to be such a tough thing
8194928 i played in a canadian market for nine years when he was with vancouver and i absolutely loved it there obviously there were a couple of years there that were tougher than others but i absolutely loved it i loved being in the spotlight and being part of that obviously ive been gone for a little bit but im quite excited to be back in a city like this i think its going to be a lot of fun
8194929 its similar to being back in vancouver as far as being on the streets and being recognized wherever you go
8194930 everyone has been very respectful and i hope it continues especially when my family is around
8194931 i cant lie its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear especially after coming in here so many times with vancouver

8195136 i know what we can expect in tashkent because ive been there with south korea
8195137 ive also watched about four or five dvds of the uzbekistan team so for me they are not a big surprise any more
8195138 they play in a russian style and whoever watched the russians play at euro 2008 would know that they are doing very well at the moment
8195139 they uzbeks are strong tough and well organised in the european way
8195140 but our players are used to this kind of football more so than that of other asians so the uzbeks style will suit us
8195141 the uzbek fans are fanatical and it will be a hectic evening in tashkent im looking forward to the challenge especially because we are going to have a good preparation
8195142 everybody is focusing on japan because they are a power in the region but i know the uzbeks from the asian games in doha in 2006 and we know them from the 2007 asian cup and they were the first team to qualify for this final phase of qualifying
8195143 so there is no reason at all to underestimate these opponents it will be a big game and a good result could help our qualification a lot
8195144 i spent a few days in istanbul to watch him play in a league match

8195147 yes harry is thrilled with his new challenge in a new league and in a totally new world
8195148 i might try a few little things or i might start with the team that will have to perform in uzbekistan

8195152 was keen to portray himself as a moderate muslim palestinian born who had lived in the west for 3 decades his speech became heated as he progressed then in the question time that followed the other 2 speakers he launched into a tirade against the west and its centuries of imperialism blaming it for all the ills that beset the muslim world most people in the packed audience became uneasy in part i suspect it was simply that australians mistrust fanatics of any persuasion i am fed up with blame the west dogma and responded accordingly i pointed out that during 3 quarters of the 500 year rise of the modern west it was the islamic ottoman empire that had controlled most of the middle east if colonialism was to blame for the geopolitical failure of islam then the main culprits were the turks in brisbane the deep ambivalence that a muslim such as bari atwan bears towards the west was striking on the one hand he chooses to live in london and enjoy the freedom to publish his newspaper presumably he likes the comforts of a modern western metropolis its prosperity its efficiency the fact things work and the peaceful civilty of everyday life ambivalence is normal in immigrants it is inevitable that many newcomers will have mixed feelings about having uprooted themselves and cast themselves into an alien place but what was different in brisbane was the intensity of hostility in fact hatred towards whatever it was in the west that galled flowing under a veneer of moderation was a tide of resentment

8195186 the team have forgotten the match in liege it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8195187 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
8195188 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8195189 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8195190 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8195191 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change
8195192 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football

8195194 relationships commitment bore me to a maximum point i wont certainly feel more alive if i date regularly a guy in fact ive tried sometimes in the past and i felt i was losing myself in it i didnt like it how come i could feel more alive in a situation like this i do enjoy my freedom and my ability to pick the man i want when i want with no strings attached this is what makes me feel alive but there are plenty other occasions where i can feel alive for example if i get rewarded for my job or get social recognition
8195195 even if i do enjoy my life with the job i love and all my friends i have this feeling of emptiness in my love life if i find the man of my dreams i know i would feel more alive it s not that i dont feel alive at all its just that i would feel more
8195196 when im in love i feel extraordinary i dont see the world the same way than when im single i feel over the moon and i love that feeling
8195197 we broke up for a stupid reason and seven months after the break up i was still not over him i was just the shadow of myself during that period crying and not wanting anything my friends did help me to recover but in my heart i knew i wanted him back and he came back after eight months he told me he thought about what went wrong between us and that he couldnt live without me even if he tried since we got back together i have this feeling to be alive again he brought me to life

8195208 he just told me that i should try for it and i submitted my name
8195209 they sort of voted for me as a representation of youth enthusiasm
8195210 so it was mainly i think that people were just excited about students being out there
8195211 you see it on tv but its nowhere near the same
8195212 ted kennedy was amazing i actually broke into tears during his speech by the time michelle obama got up i was just a crying mess i just kept on pinching myself because i wasnt sure it was real

8195214 being with the people at berkeley thats an experience in itself i think celebrating with my friends here will be just as good if not better

8195217 i think getting to be a delegate is now one of my new goals
8195218 being here as a volunteer and a college student i have to wiggle my way into things a bit being a delegate i would get to represent the candidate and get to be a part of everything in a more significant way and i think it would be a position of great honor

8195220 i am here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8195221 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8195222 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8195223 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8195224 with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8195225 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8195226 were you in this campaign just for me were you in it for all the people who feel invisible
8195227 there is no chasm too deep no barrier too great and no ceiling too high for all who work hard who keep going have faith in god in our country and in each other
8195228 that is our mission as democrats to elect barack obama
8195229 id love to see a woman president but the party will survive
8195230 ive been meeting with a lot of the clinton supporters and they are dealing with this its not easy but they get it
8195231 we felt women were being shoved around told to go away and be quiet its over and done

8195233 weve got to make sure the job is done that john mccain is not elected in the fall we have to move on this is a fact of life now

8195242 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
8195243 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
8195244 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
8195245 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
8195246 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
8195247 wat er in amerika gebeurt is vooral belangrijk voor de modale amerikaan maar het heeft wel een weerslag op ons
8195248 hoe je het ook draait of keert amerika is een zeer bepalend land onder bush kun je niet anders dan zeggen dit is het wereldtoneel dat wij willen daarom is het heel vreemd dat mensen als pieter de crem weer de schoothond van de amerikanen willen worden
8195249 europa wil wel een voortrekkersrol spelen op het gebied van klimaatverandering maar we hebben daar bondgenoten voor nodig de vs zullen met de democraten meer geneigd zijn om op dat vlak met ons samen te werken wij proberen hier te leren waar ze naartoe willen en contacten leggen om in een latere fase samen te werken mocht obama winnen
8195250 hoe je het ook draait of keert de stemming in dit land heeft een heel grote invloed op de rest van de wereld zoals reagan thatcher heeft ge nspireerd heeft bill clinton tony blair wim kok en zelfs de actieve welvaartsstaat bij ons ge nspireerd
8195251 dat obama ervoor zou zorgen dat de sp a meer winstkansen zou krijgen is te kort door de bocht maar hier kunnen we inspiratie opdoen hoe profileer je jezelf tegenover een neoliberaal regime zoals we in belgi nu hebben
8195252 hij symboliseert de wereld zoals hij vandaag is dat is een wereld die divers en interdependent is het is hoopgevend dat zo iemand zon grote verantwoordelijkheid zou kunnen krijgen in het belangrijkste land van de wereld het k n dat is het mooie van amerika
8195253 veertig jaar geleden had obama niets eens aanwezig mogen zijn op de conventie waar hij vandaag de nominee is
8195254 het is moeilijk om de dingen met elkaar te vergelijken iedereen is anders en obama is niet hetzelfde als een marokkaan in antwerpen ik denk eerlijk gezegd dat het pas zal doordringen als hij werkelijk verkozen wordt
8195255 de manier waarop ze via het internet heel veel mensen bij hun verhaal betrekken is bijzonder inspirerend wij moeten ook veel meer netwerken maken en met mensen in discussie gaan
8195256 je moet dat proberen want anders ben je een partij van het verleden wij proberen onze leden een soort facebook community te laten zijn die ook onder elkaar communiceert op die manier weet je ik heb me aangesloten bij sp a maar wie zijn nu die andere leden en waar zijn zij in ge nteresseerd
8195257 internet is een geweldige manier om bijvoorbeeld te zeggen ik ben ge nteresseerd in milieu ik druk op de knop en ik weet wie daar nog over wil praten wij hoeven niet alles centraal te stimuleren hoe meer er gediscussieerd wordt hoe groter de kans dat daar goeie idee n uit voortvloeien

8195262 the use of snmp alarm monitoring within the power manager mdus ensures that any networked hardware can be remotely managed from anywhere in the world
8195263 the ability to intelligently monitor and control rack hardware remotely over wan or lan irrespective of the geographic location of that hardware is a very powerful and cost efficient proposition for broadcasters today
8195264 with the growing number of tv stations over the past few years and their need to stand out from the crowd the demand for high quality 3d graphics has picked up significantly
8195265 at the same time tv stations are looking for solutions that are simple easy to use and do not require high cost of ownership to date you could either choose a simple 2d character generator or a high end yet more complicated 3d system morpho 3d is positioned to bridge this gap and brings the best from all sides
8195266 morpho 3d is a brand new product resulting from an intense two year development phase the system offers a new and refreshing approach to how real time 3d graphics should be created in todays television production environment
8195267 television broadcasts of the worlds most popular sports events are watched in exactly the same format in highly different markets whereas advertisers are looking for segmented audiences
8195268 billboard ads visible throughout the sporting events create attention values that are manifold compared with ads on commercial breaks the ability to digitally change the billboard content to best suit different audiences has achieved great interest from both tv rights holders and advertisers
8195269 tv rights and advertising slots in sporting events are bought and sold for huge sums of money around the globe
8195270 dbrlive gives organisers sports clubs sports federations and television right holders as opportunity to multiple the value of their events by enabling advertisers to target their messages we are impressed by supponors system and are true believers in its success
8195271 there are already several players in the market that produce digital content and place it on top of the television picture their offerings typically range from graphics that help viewers follow the event to digital ads that appear on screen independently of physical billboards
8195272 the unique advantage of dbrlive is that digital ads are placed exactly on top of real world billboards which allows advertisers to reach their desired target groups without a risk of being blamed invasive or intrusive

8195285 ao contr rio dos estere tipos em todos os pa ses analisados atributos envolvendo respeito social foram citados com muito mais freq ncia como fatores que definem a masculinidade do que aqueles apenas concentrados na sexualidade
8195286 o conjunto de resultados dessa pesquisa ressalta a import ncia para os homens dos aspectos n o sexuais na constru o da identidade masculina

8195291 the way it should be worked is that the police officer decides a person is going too fast for the conditions then uses the radar gun to check what speed theyre doing
8195292 then they can produce evidence to prosecute them for that you cant do that from 3000 feet
8195293 thats not an effective use of the helicopter but officers are in it every time its up so if they spot something its absolutely right that they should act

8195312 regardless of who it is fans are going to be gutted as the mcqueen sisters are some of the most popular characters on the show
8195313 all that can be revealed at the moment is that there is plenty of blood and a huge explosion
8195314 we are truly a nation of soap lovers and consider the regular characters friends we invite them into our homes every week to entertain us but there is no denying that all of those selected are renowned for being unkempt and in need of a good clean
8195315 we have launched our soap awards to name and shame some of our best loved characters and will be sending them all a bar or two of our new theakstons soap to use
8195316 we decided to bring our traditional ingredients and strong brand associations to a distinctive high quality skincare product

8195319 even for a highly decorated and often recognized scientist like bob this represents a remarkable and extraordinary achievement
8195320 i am particularly excited and pleased to see dr lefkowitz work recognized in this way as his discoveries represent the very best in translational science and medicine and have served to ultimately improve the health and lives of millions of people around the globe
8195321 deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical biological mathematical or engineering sciences
8195322 the national medal of science is a great personal and professional honor that reflects my entire career in the life sciences
8195323 one of the most rewarding aspects of my career at duke has been the opportunity to mentor more than 200 very talented students and fellows many of them have gone on to distinguished careers in academia and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries this award honors them as much as it does me i really cant imagine a more fulfilling career for me than to have been a professor of medicine and a scientist i am as excited about the opportunities and challenges of our work at present as i have ever been and i am so honored that the president will acknowledge our cumulative body of work in medicine and the biological sciences
8195324 im thrilled that bob is being honored in this way as it really is a recognition and celebration of not only his well documented seminal discoveries but more importantly the incredible body of scientific work that has characterized his long and illustrious career
8195325 he is an inspiration to the next generation of basic scientists not only at duke but around the world
8195326 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
8195327 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
8195328 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
8195329 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
8195330 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

8195334 prima delle vacanze ha detto il papa davanti a 8mila fedeli riuniti nellaula paolo vi avevo iniziato una nuova serie di catechesi su san paolo in occasione dellanno paolino e vorrei oggi riprendere questo filo oggi vorrei proporre una breve sua biografia
8195335 paolo ha proseguito benedetto xvi appare collocato sulla frontiera di tre culture diverse e forse anche per questo era disponibile a feconde aperture universalistiche come si riveler nel corso della vita
8195336 il suo fu un atteggiamento di intolleranza qui ha aggiunto che si colloca levento di damasco
8195337 da quel momento in poi la sua vita cambi ed egli divent un apostolo instancabile del vangelo
8195338 san paolo ha concluso ratzinger si dedicato allannuncio del vangelo senza risparmio di energie affrontando una serie di prove gravose questo il paolo che sta davanti ai nostri occhi stimolo costante per limpegno ecclesiale di tutti noi
8195339 gli affanni delle nazioni siano nelle nostre preghiere e nel nostro impegno missionario
8195340 si sia dedicato allannuncio del vangelo senza risparmio di energie affrontando una serie di prove gravose
8195341 possa lesempio di san paolo insegnarci a testimoniare infaticabilmente cristo e affrontare con coraggio le prove della vita per metterle sotto lo sguardo di cristo mettiamo come lui gli affanni delle nazioni nelle nostre preghiere e nel nostro impegno missionario
8195342 the ability to cost effectively control up to 6 independent displays with the qmd frame or up to 12 independent displays with qmd x is astonishing
8195343 using a proven technology like auxkeys to enhance the visual impact of live productions in virtually any facility is just another compelling reason to choose ross vision qmd x production switchers
8195344 it seems astounding that the place behind one of britains greatest ever achievements cannot be saved and memorialised
8195345 to me it is equivalent to letting nelsons column fall down or wellingtons victory arch crumble to dust an outrage to think we have not the will nor the historical understanding to save it

8195354 lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
8195355 look honey i spliced this wire to the usb hub and its powering up

8195362 this does not include pre k enrollment we had 8 696 students on the first day last year we had 8 697 students during the last two or three years enrollment has been fairly stable gaining about 30 students
8195363 it will be different after labor day and during the second month we have some students who unfortunately do not come in until after labor day
8195364 well i think we had a really smooth day you always have people who need to get used to the schedule changes from summer to school sometimes it takes more time on the first few days
8195365 wednesday is the first day for kindergarten and pre k students dont come in until friday
8195366 its up in some places and down in some places a lot of things dont level off until after labor day
8195367 the laws themselves have helped us get to our goal of zero fatalities
8195368 at the end of the day thats the guy whos going to get us to zero
8195369 last week at this time i didnt know how many people would show up but then the reservations started rolling in its very gratifying
8195370 the way the show is laid out is helpful to vendors
8195371 the volunteers and the chamber staff are doing an exceptional job of presenting a first class symposium that is addressing one of the major challenges facing the coal industry
8195372 we actually have about 128 on our demolition list right now
8195373 if we issue an order on all of those it will add 10 more but i dont know if that will be the case some of them may be delayed
8195374 even with the 55 we have torn down over the last couple of years it is an ongoing and pervasive problem
8195375 so i hope weve got the mechanics in place to deal with it in a timely fashion what weve found is one dilapidated house on a street leads to another and another its almost like a cancer that spreads and grows so we hope to be able to deal with it quickly before the blight spreads
8195376 as far as i know most of them are just vacant
8195377 frequently we have people who pass away and either dont have any heirs or the heirs live out of the area and have no interest in the property
8195378 it is an ongoing problem but we hope weve turned the corner on being able to deal with them
8195379 city crews have demolished four structures within the last week or so utilizing our own landfill that we reopened so we believe it will be a real cost effective means for us to deal with the problem and of course we hope the end result is improvement in each individual neighborhood and hopefully new growth
8195380 a lot of them would be suitable for new buildings
8195381 but some of the lots are pretty small because they are old
8195382 no one has received any trauma related counseling or orientation on hygiene and sanitation issues
8195383 many said the prime minister should have given priority to the epic struggle for survival instead of visiting china for the closing ceremony of the olympics
8195384 the government should find their missing loved ones and provide food proper shelter clothes medication and a long term solution as their houses and land have been destroyed by the flood
8195385 the indian technical team mobilized required resources and has remained in readiness to carry out the required work to strengthen the embankment
8195386 but it was prevented from reaching the site as a consequence thousands of people in nepal and india have been forced to suffer a calamity that could have been avoided
8195387 the successful april elections signal that the people of nepal are entering a hopeful phase for peace and prosperity
8195388 however the promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children whose lives have been adversely affected by the conflict today they are still in the maoist cantonments they must be released immediately unmin un mission in nepal child protection advisers unicef and its partners should have access to these children to make sure that they receive their rights to recovery and reintegration
8195389 as the largest party the maoists were to hold the first position in the coalition cabinet with nine ministers including prime minister
8195390 as the second largest party in the alliance the uml was to have six ministries including deputy pm
8195391 however the maoists insisted on the first slot as well as the second relegating the uml to the third spot that is unacceptable to us
8195392 since the maoists did not get simple majority in the election they have to forge a consensus with the uml and the mjf if they can do that there will be stability in nepal and the main task the drafting of a new constitution in two years will be accomplished
8195393 however if they fail to do so the focus will be diffused and the main agenda of the parties will be reduced to a game of forming and dissolving governments
8195394 but if youll only say at once youll be my wife ill not go a step farther
8195395 camps ive gone to have really helped out and good coaching along the way from the time i started as a sophomore in high school up until now
8195396 i never thought that i could be the no 1 guy in our conference to be at the top of our conference listed with names like ricky schmitt a 2008 shepherd university graduate whos punting now for the 49ers its a big honor
8195397 wed like to allow him to focus on punting i think he could be one of the best punters in the country if hes allowed to focus on that so weve done that
8195398 he told me about how good an academic school it was and about its rich football history in the 70s and 90s and being close to home also really played a role
8195399 i played a little bit of receiver in high school too
8195400 and athletes coming from all over the country are better than what you see in high school
8195401 everybody that plays college ball wants to go to the next level
8195402 but if its not gods will i will go into teaching coaching anything i can do to help younger kids
8195403 we have a lot more talent it seems like weve got more depth our skill positions are as deep as they ever have been on our defense weve returned a lot of starters this year
8195404 weve still got really young players but then weve got experienced players to lead the way
8195405 hes about 5 foot 3 but he has a nice leg and hes a wonderful young man hes going to be handling the field goal chores
8195406 we look the best weve looked in the four years ive been here
8195407 if were winning games and i never touch the field its fine with me as long as were winning games
8195408 field position wins games if we give our defense good field position they can stop the other teams offense and it goes vice versa
8195409 i can confirm that i am joining spurs right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to london to sign a contract
8195410 i will not play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8195411 we have just reached a verbal agreement but pavlyuchenko is likely join tottenham in the near future
8195412 je crois que nous tous incluant bien s r ma propre famille sattendons ce que les choses que lon ach te ou que lon mange soient s curitaires a fait valoir le premier ministre cest un enjeu majeur cest pourquoi jai indiqu quil est n cessaire de r former nos syst mes dinspection
8195413 je veux massurer que nous puissions compter sur les filets de s curit et de protection les plus s rs a affirm le ministre ontarien de la sant je craindrais toute proposition qui risquerait daffaiblir les r gles de s curit de lontario et du canada
8195414 they competed theyve both done well theyre both good players and they both did things that win football games
8195415 in the long term and if we can get this done this is what were going to do today i think for the overall good of the program this is a good thing
8195416 we went through preseason like we said and we let them compete
8195417 i dont think you could pick one over the other i think both of them did some good things
8195418 im believe long term that if we can get it done if everybody stays healthy and were playing well i think everybody believes this is what is best long term for virginia tech
8195419 that is another thing that enters into it corys been around
8195420 hes not a new guy so having him as a backup is a real plus in this situation so having him there gives us a chance to make this work also
8195421 he needs to stay in there mentally and we need to get him a few reps just to keep the thing going but cory will be getting the majority of the second team reps
8195422 a lot of things could happen as the season goes along but as of today this is our plan and that is what were going to do
8195423 tyrod would like to do this he wanted to redshirt and were always going to try what is best for the player and what his desires are
8195424 as we looked at this thing long term there is no question if we can get this done then this is the best thing for virginia tech football
8195425 this is a good plan because youve got a good quarterback in sean that has played very well
8195426 he got us down the field right before the half at virginia and did the same thing the acc championship game
8195427 hes had a lot of successful plays and hes very smart hes very knowledgeable hes been in a lot of battles and hes done a lot of good things here at virginia tech
8195428 i think a quarterback is kind of like a coach if youre winning youre ok and if youre losing youre not ok
8195429 that is the way it is with a quarterback but i know hes mature enough that he understands that hes been successful
8195430 with a quarterback a lot of times its the people that you can put around him too
8195431 i think all of those things enter into a guys career too
8195432 theres no question hes solid hes smart hes experienced and hes made some plays for virginia tech hes helped win a lot of big games and we expect the same thing this year
8195433 youve got a guy who three more years of eligibility in tyrod and tyrod is only going to get better
8195434 the more experience and the more learning the more time involved he is only going to get better and better and hes a talented guy
8195435 i think this is settled im a guy that likes to get settled and then its full speed ahead
8195436 sometimes when youve got a couple of different options youre always having trouble getting exactly settled
8195437 i think we know exactly the direction were going right now and now it is full speed ahead

8195454 can you get pregnant while you have a yeast infection
8195455 ive said it before theyre in better shape than we are but ive also said this series in august isnt going to determine who is going to play in october but we needed this series more than they did and they got the first one
8195456 to come into their house and get the first one thats huge
8195457 we went them both we want them both we do
8195458 if youre trying to throw it on the right side of the plate it means my elbow probably dropped a little bit so i was probably a little tired
8195459 i think todd was the pitcher thats why strategy is so beautiful somebody might have pitched somebody else
8195460 i look at those first three runs and he pitched better than three runs he made two hittable pitches and it was 5 0
8195461 we had good at bats sometimes we hit the ball hard sometimes we didnt
8195462 that last inning was flat i would think flat would be a compliment it wasnt as good as flat but it wasnt a flat game they were just better than we were today
8195463 we dont want to be 5 out going into september we need to stay right about where we are
8195464 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8195465 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8195466 im all for getting the home runs right i think its great
8195467 all in all you want to get the call right one way or the other although obviously you want to get it right if its advantageous for you and the team
8195468 but in some of the newer ballparks there are not real definitive lines
8195469 this is what instant replay is and it will not be expanded
8195470 i dont believe that whole slippery slope thing i dont think well have robots behind the plate
8195471 on friday in florida if i dont see something like i should because im human then i have an assistant to get to the bottom of it as a tool for umpires its got to help
8195472 this isnt the commissioners game this isnt my game and this isnt your game this is the peoples game
8195473 you look at all the polls this is what people want
8195474 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8195475 i really think the game prospered well for over a century doing things the way we did them
8195476 but when you look at the technology we have and you look at the new ballparks and the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question it was a challenge to the umpires and everybody else

8195497 das zeigt dass mindestl hne generell und gerade jetzt falsch sind sie gef hrden arbeitspl tze
8195498 um die folgen eines mindestlohns zu bewerten reicht es nicht die besch ftigung direkt vor und nach dem stichtag seiner einf hrung zu betrachten
8195499 well supposedly there are seven because this is the no 8 rivalry in the nation
8195500 there are college kids who dont play in front of as big a crowd as well play in front of on friday night its just a great atmosphere were fortunate to be part of something like that because very few people ever are part of something like this
8195501 it means a lot theres a lot of honor and pride in it you go out there and try to uphold graham high school pride
8195502 im sure that they were anxious friday night but this is a different type of anxiousness i reckon this friday night
8195503 to just practice hard and go out there friday night and just focus on the game and focus on winning
8195504 well find out friday if theres any advantage to it
8195505 some people will say theres advantage some will say theres not well just have to wait and see
8195506 we thought wed play better in some areas but we didnt play as well as we thought wed play but weve addressed that were addressing that this week
8195507 we felt like we were able to move the ball pretty well we were able to throw the ball at times fairly well
8195508 weve got to work on ball security and weve got to work on tackling and being in the right places you cant cowboy our defense its an assignment type of defense if anybody tries to cowboy it were in trouble
8195509 offense definitely we had a very good game on offense and we had some things on defense if theyd gone maybe an inch different wed have had a good defense that night
8195510 were working on those things this week to make them better and i believe well be all right come bluefield
8195511 theyve got guys who can run good quickness theyve got a fullback running back when theyre in the slot they throw the ball well theyve got guys who can catch the ball
8195512 thats the nice thing about our early schedule youve got to go go go theres no down time you dont have some people might call it the luxury of having an off week
8195513 we think it gets us ready to compete in the southwest district by playing good teams teams with a lot of speed teams with a lot of strength and quickness we feel like its to our advantage to see that type of talent week in and week out during our non district games
8195514 makes you want to go out there twice as hard and try to bring in a win
8195515 theyre supposed to lead by example and thats what we hope our kids do is to lead by example not only on the field but in the classroom and off the field also
8195516 you see different things from different people a lot of them are silent leaders they dont say a whole lot they just lead by their action
8195517 we really dont have a rah rah guy and thats ok you dont need a rah rah guy you need somebody to go out there and practice hard every day and play hard every day and weve got guys who will do that
8195518 although theyre playing different positions but its nice to have the number of kids that have played for the younger kids to look at and to see how they do play
8195519 makes you want to go out and play harder obviously its a huge game for anybody i believe you want to bring more intensity to it its that much of a bigger game not exactly like a regular game
8195520 its my last year to beat em so i want to go out there and do the very best i can i want to know that my teammates are going to do the same and i know that

8195552 our new topical spray approach to protecting individuals during seasonal or epidemic flu outbreaks is a radical new paradigm to protect people from these influenza viruses the fact that the anadis antibodies are all natural and topically applied means we may have a very safe and effective new approach to provide immediate protection to all persons and be able to address multiple virus strains we know from current failures in vaccine protection among many persons this past year that indeed novel approaches like this are urgently needed
8195553 this work supports an aggressive commercial strategy expanding our intellectual property position in this unique area our approach shows for the first time a cost effective method of fighting influenza using antibodies we plan to move on our own and with partners to bring this revolutionary product to market

8195608 the minister has reminded the union that there were breaches of the collective labour agreement during the course of bilateral meetings and also during conciliation workers of various estates went on strike in clear violation of the collective labour agreement this present strike the minister noted is no different except that this strike has caused a shutdown of the industrys production and can severely damage this industry forever
8195609 we wish to renew the call that increase in pay for all workers ought to be greater than the rate of inflation
8195610 well known that there is no trust existing between management and the workers in the industry so promises are written on ice
8195611 high cost of living has been outrunning the meagre wages paid to the hard working employees for the past years with annual wages way below the national inflation rate compounding the loss in the value of real wages
8195612 the unions in the industry have been advising guysuco of the impeding action but again the company has been taking their employees for granted
8195613 production has struggled to regain the levels attained since the early 2000s and guysuco is forecasting 285 000 tonnes production for 2008

8195619 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8195620 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges
8195621 were going as quickly as we can and the town is not facing emergency services being cut or anything like that
8195622 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8195623 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8195624 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8195625 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures
8195626 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8195627 i hope that didnt happen overnight but there has already been evidence that the armies are pushing away the ossetians who favored georgia and in a certain way yes an ethnic cleansing is taking place
8195628 this is going to get worse and its an extremely dangerous situation

8195636 over the course of today there have been a number of hijackings and attacks on both psni and local residents in the craigavon area there have been unconfirmed reports of a number of shots being fired the people behind these incidents are anti social and anti community
8195637 if any of the republican micro groups are part of any of these incidents then they should publicly accept responsibility and explain how hijacking local peoples cars and disrupting everyday life in the community advances one iota the goal of irish reunification

8195639 the departure of leslie morrison from invest ni presents a new opportunity to the executive to deliver on its obligation of removing regional disparity in economic investment in the north
8195640 leslie morrison and his predecessors unfortunately inherited the legacy of regional disparity in investment which was institutionalised by the unionist regime at stormont was not addressed under direct rule and to date invest ni has failed to properly tackle the issue
8195641 we expect the government to pull all stops with an expansionary populist budget designed to yield maximum political mileage during this critical period for the government
8195642 the twin overriding objective would be to placate public unhappiness over soaring inflation as well as keep the bn ruling coalition component parties happy and minimise the possibility of further defections to the opposition coalition

8195645 mauras background in working both inside and outside the library system will help her communicate with a broad public audience the shape of the new public library services in this digital age
8195646 her dynamic style deep seated commitment to open principles and demonstrated success at implementing partnerships and initiatives in the digital space will be a powerful combination in taking the oca to the next level
8195647 we are delighted that maura will take on this leadership role at such an important juncture for the organization the open content alliance represents the largest group of libraries universities and cultural heritage institutions in the world supporting a universal digital library that is truly open non profit and non exclusive
8195648 over the past three years members of the oca have made incredibly important strides toward building a truly open digital information commons and i am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead the organization to new levels of growth and collaboration
8195649 cervical cancer is preventable through screening yet the indigenous women of guyana have never been screened due to the extreme difficulty encountered in reaching their remote villages

8195652 six years have been a long time for any sponsor to continue sponsoring an event in this country what we have had over the years is a lot of sponsors coming on board for just a few years and then moving on
8195653 i think this is a memorable contribution from clico to cricket in guyana under 17 is a vital team where the youngsters start their developmental process this age group bridges the gap between under 15 and under 19 when clico came on board in 2003 and they are still with us and it is an important competition for us
8195654 a lot of youths would go astray after playing under 15 so we would lose them but with clicos sponsorship we have been able to keep them active leading up to their senior years at least all of the cricketers who have gone on to represent guyana over the past few years have played in this tournament
8195655 this years sponsorship will be done in two parts in the first part we will be donating to the gcb the sum of 1 3m which will be used for the mobilization of teams and expenses occurred with the matches
8195656 the remainder of the sponsorship will go towards the purchasing of gifts for outstanding players as well as the outfitting of the teams along with the branding of the venue for the final match
8195657 if you want them to be tortured you send them to syria if you want someone to disappear never to see them again you send them to egypt

8195664 for many companies the cost of dealing with the hundreds of devices and thousands of configurations often means that their mobile applications never make it off the drawing board with alembic for the first time companies can base their development decision on accurate verified information this is like giving developers a personalized crystal ball to understand their market
8195665 the deal clearly marks aspirations of top indian firms to play a big role on the global it services scene they are re building themselves as their age old selling proposition based on low cost quality and process superiority gets commoditised
8195666 this deal is the first yet substantial step towards building superior business transformation capability to match traditional back office services such as application development and maintenance

8195689 provoke enough thought to cause the audience to take a second look at what they consider important as they live and love and express themselves as caribbean people
8195690 our chief concern is that we never underestimate an opponent
8195691 are we going to have offsides are we going to have mental breakdowns are we going to stay together
8195692 because theres going to be crunch time in every game
8195693 i told the team i didnt want them to feel any pressure because i want them to be loose in every game
8195694 the trip out west to play in that january bowl game was just about the bowl game this is all about making an impression
8195695 a long time ago as a little kid i learned that the most lasting impression is your first impression so this needs to be a big first impression
8195696 i hope i remain the same guy ive got a nice bride at home whos going to make sure i dont crow too much

8195698 with strife threatening pakistans borders and its economy limping the danger is not that india and the us have lost a comfortable relationship with musharraf but that nostalgia will blind them to the opportunities that political change might bring

8195701 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest mobile marketing event in the us to date
8195702 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
8195703 even after unification of the two parties including the nepali congress and the nc democratic they have not been united emotionally
8195704 so all party members said an early general convention was the only way to unite the party and revive its deteriorating strength
8195705 we worked hard we ran hard and we blocked hard we wanted to show people what we could do
8195706 whatever happens well just have to see how everything goes
8195707 we had to drive all the way to berwind to practice it took a lot of time when we could have been practicing instead of riding a bus all the way over there
8195708 ever since i was a little kid ive watched people up here playing for big creek
8195709 we won all of them but one and we were right there and they st paul were one of the best teams in virginia and we lost by a touchdown
8195710 mount hope was a big win but probably the iaeger game
8195711 we came back from a three touchdown deficit at halftime they didnt score on us in the second half
8195712 definitely beating iaeger its always a big rivalry and we always want to beat them
8195713 they said we had one running back and i went up there and did pretty well
8195714 it was just something they told us we wanted to go out there and prove it was a team not just one person
8195715 it was really disappointing the other two games we should have won easy
8195716 but we knew that meadow bridge was going to be our roughest game
8195717 we can match up with teams just as well as we did last year said riffe whose owls lost several seniors including all everything benton and 325 pound lineman chris hale
8195718 im hoping to do just as good if not a little better and i believe we can
8195719 definitely im excited to be back on the football field
8195720 weve got to give it everything weve got and go after it
8195721 wir werden mit puppen nicht sprechen wir brauchen den puppenspieler das hei t moskau

8195724 and the biggest one reason is the way uk historically has played in its season opener under rick brooks which is to say not at all well
8195725 brooks has never beaten u of l in an opener but more than that in four years of playing the cardinals in the first game his uk teams have managed just one first quarter touchdown and they werent facing blockbuster u of l defenses either
8195726 for eight straight years the winning teams top rusher out gained the entire opposing team rafael little did that last year
8195727 because both teams figure to use multiple backs that streak might be in jeopardy but lets say that uks defensive line it best unit stuffs the u of l run now the wildcats are free to try to control things with their own running game something their talented backfield is capable of doing but they can do that only if they can keep u of l honest through the air and thats a shaky proposition
8195728 because both teams figure to use multiple backs that streak might be in jeopardy
8195729 the cardinals meanwhile have one thing in the game that might be most important experience at quarterback
8195730 uk has the better defense and probably the better running game it should also have a special teams advantage and unlike in past years the speed factor is beginning to turn in uks favor
8195731 but u of l has cantwell home field and perhaps more urgency certainly more pressure to win
8195732 but i make that pick with all of the confidence i have in my lottery numbers
8195733 men h jtrykket rykker desv rre videre stp efter weekenden det betyder at vi fra mandag igen vil f bygevejr og temperaturer p 19 20 grader

8195747 sono un senatore degli stati uniti damerica perche nel 1948 un gruppo di donne coraggiose e alcuni uomini temerari molti viaggiando per giorni e giorni si riunirono a new york per partecipare alla prima convention della nostra storia sui diritti delle donne

8195749 ed e stata sostenuta da qualche figlio e nipote lungo il percorso
8195750 hanno trovato negli occhi dei loro figli e nipoti immaginando un mondo piu equo e piu libero il coraggio di combattere
8195751 fino a che 88 anni fa in questo stesso giorno il xix emendamento che garantisce alle donne il diritto di voto e stato inserito per sempre nella nostra costituzione

8195759 how was it that by 1900 britain controlled nearly a quarter of the world
8195760 although we may be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
8195761 black history is not just about slavery it is much broader than that it is about the contribution that black and asian people have made throughout history the benefits are that pupils gain a better appreciation of the multicultural society around them and the contribution they can make
8195762 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8195763 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8195764 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised
8195765 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use
8195766 my house is in foreclosure because we failed to pay the monthly payments since my wife got hurt in her job she was almost a year out of work i lost her income theres no way i can afford to pay for this house what will happen a week from now what do you expect ill be on the street probably ill look for an apartment but thats life in america
8195767 for me catering to the dutch public im doing very well american colleagues of mine are really in a very bad situation its difficult for them to find clients for me on the other because im dealing with europeans with a strong euro ive never sold so many houses as this year
8195768 we looked at 80 houses in three days all in one resort when you do that you see lots of human suffering you see from a distance that people arent doing well and i really didnt like that you feel like a vulture circling overhead that was the not so nice side of it
8195769 he is a good football coach we will be doing a lot of the same things we have been doing around here
8195770 it depends on what kind of offense we are facing as to what type of defense we will play
8195771 im excited about the defense just from the sheer numbers
8195772 we are probably not probably we are faster than we have been since i have been here and we have depth
8195773 one of our problems last year was a lack of depth along the defensive line that seems to be a strong suit for us this year im excited about that group
8195774 we have depth and i think we are going to be a fast fast defense
8195775 he has poise he lets things bounce right off of him and has the ability to focus on the next play
8195776 he has been doing a good job of running our offense
8195777 thats still up in the air i feel the closer that we get that these are the three particularly when youve got new guys you want to be working with three
8195778 as a group theyve all done well but i think we just need more time theyre all good players theyll all competing theyll all like each other as far as i can see but its hard to say whos who
8195779 i dont think its going to be a one man situation its going to be a tandem thing
8195780 whoever virginia tech running backs coach billy hits has on the field is going to make the plays
8195781 thats what this group is its not just one style theres a lot of horses in that stable so were going to put everybody on the field and everybody is going to make plays
8195782 i dont like going into a game against a good team like east carolina with 41 percent of your players never having played in a game
8195783 i dont like that will make you nervous in a hurry but i do like the fact that we really do have some good young players
8195784 i will say this i looked down there monday and i said boy that is a good looking group and it is
8195785 if you look at the wide receiver group right now theyll all 6 1 6 2 6 3 and prince parker is 6 6
8195786 i would hope that if it is one on one that we can get out there and if its a jump ball that weve got a shot at it
8195787 i feel our first defense is very good very fast they play fast i think were very good
8195788 i think were in the process of finding some backup guys weve got some backup guys that we feel good about but theres still some openings there
8195789 i think the success overall of our defense is getting sound with the second group were closer right now than we were but i still think weve got some work to do
8195790 we need to play see where we are and get a starting point
8195791 were moving forward with it and im sure that sometime before 3 31 p m on saturday well have it figured out
8195792 what weve wanted to do was to create a circumstance of sanity where the players could just be three other players going to practice working on the game
8195793 it was their thought in the first place and as soon as it was mentioned it seemed to make a lot of sense and its worked out great theyve had a nice quiet sane period of time to do what they were supposed to do work on their game not become the team spokesman wittingly or unwittingly
8195794 if it takes that anointing for the players to see leadership in a quarterback theres probably not very much leadership there in the first place
8195795 kirsten met andrew at a gig in new york in july and set her sights on him then
8195796 she was then backstage with him at lowlands in holland and pukkelpop in belgium earlier this month its all a bit mucky as he has been linked with johnnys ex fabiola
8195797 well actually i have a studio at the house benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show her new uk reality show for mtv hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
8195798 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie i am so excited london is one of my favorite cities in the world or should i say favourite

8195846 i think breast implants are awful ive felt them and they are awful
8195847 so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong
8195848 one of my friends t ts started growing like the giant peach and blood started coming out the nipple
8195849 and then another friend of mine had one that sort of moved up to her shoulder one t t was normal and the other was up by her collarbone

8195852 went to our dean and told him he just didnt have the time to teach anymore
8195853 maybe a possibility to reduce the time in the classroom was by taking on a co teacher so they settled on me as his co teacher with the understanding then that while he wouldnt be there for the whole class he would be there for at least half the time

8195855 this agreement is a waiver of all rights to a civil court action for a claim arising out of or related to employees employment with company only the arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the claim or dispute
8195856 i have received a copy of the employee handbook and have read it if i was not sure i fully understood a policy i asked my supervisor to provide a further explanation i agree to abide by all of the policies described in the handbook
8195857 unilateral promulgation of arbitration provisions in an employee handbook does not constitute a knowing agreement on the part of an employee to waive a statutory remedy provided by a civil rights law

8195872 paolo ha proseguito benedetto xvi appare collocato sulla frontiera di tre culture diverse e forse anche per questo era disponibile a feconde aperture universalistiche come si riveler nel corso della vita
8195873 il suo fu un atteggiamento di intolleranza qui ha aggiunto che si colloca levento di damasco
8195874 da quel momento in poi la sua vita cambi ed egli divent un apostolo instancabile del vangelo

8195889 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants

8195892 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8195893 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday from different areas it became tough for us to care for the baby
8195894 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8195895 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8195896 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8195897 it has been a contributing factor in that i havent been able to get out on the park but its more that i feel that the club is going in a different direction with the young players coming through and i dont want to be in their way
8195898 i still havent made a final decision about playing footy again next year
8195899 bill and stephanie and lori and kate and john and henry and whispering
8195900 with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8195901 on that path to freedom harriet tubman had one piece of advice if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theres shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8195902 apart from applying our livery they came ready for the road
8195903 in the past wed have taken a chassis cab had to arrange for that to be painted in our colour scheme sent it to a bodybuilder and perhaps also had to organise for the tail lift to be fitted
8195904 with these dafs everything has been taken care of under one roof from a single source and we only had to have the vinyls applied
8195905 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty if its not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8195906 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8195907 what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda and he wants me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke
8195908 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word because he has as you know a fixed election date law to respect
8195909 the public will have to make a judgment on which direction for the country they want to take and who they believe is best equipped to lead the country at this particular time in history with the challenges that are before us
8195910 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive
8195911 if i dont think it can be productive then obviously its my responsibility to make sure the people of canada can elect a parliament that can proceed
8195912 certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
8195913 economic agenda that runs diametrically opposed to everything that this government stands for

8195919 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8195920 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent these amendments being finalised by the end of this year
8195921 its painful for me to either watch or listen to myself but even when youre not fully satisfied with the outcome thats what makes you hungry but there is gratification in the fact that you a make people smile b make people dance c make people laugh or d make people make babies

8195932 it was a disappointing defeat by city so were looking forward to this game
8195933 well attack the competition because i believe a premiership team will win it we want to progress as far as we can
8195934 anyone outside the top four must attack the cup because we know its a competition that is a route into europe a good cup run will lift everyone
8195935 the players were critical of themselves after the man city game i asked for some observations and the players admitted it was down to them
8195936 we need to bounce back and macclesfield is the first opportunity to do that
8195937 ill put the strongest possible team out to start with because i think we need the game after what happened on sunday
8195938 we realise macclesfield havent had the best of starts as weve had a couple of their games looked at
8195939 but theyll be looking forward to coming to upton park and will make it as difficult as they can
8195940 being a premier league side well have to overcome them theyll relish the chance to knock a premier league side out of the cup
8195941 theyre a big team who play three at the back theyre decent at set plays and work hard so we know we have a game on our hands

8195952 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8195953 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8195954 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8195955 i suppose this depends on your definition of remote but the test station farthest from anywhere has got to be this one on shetland i believe it is operated by staff from inverness who dont exactly queue up to be next to visit at one time when vosa visited the islands to carry out spot checks the bush telegraph went into action very quickly and all the old bangers vehicles that is went into hiding

8195995 die steuersenkung hilft eindeutig den menschen am meisten die schon jetzt ein f nftel ihres einkommens f r das essen ausgeben m ssen das sind die menschen die am wenigsten verdienen sie brauchen diese entlastung am dringendsten
8195996 das ist eine sp rbare entlastung das kann man nicht vom tisch wischen indem polemisiert wird dass jemand der sich teurere lebensmittel leisten kann vielleicht um 30 euro mehr spart es sind die menschen mit niedrigen einkommen die ma nahmen gegen die inflation am st rksten sp ren die denen die inflation am st rksten zugesetzt hat

8196009 so katie goes back to home farm to stable the horses and get changed when i walk in i find matthew being held hostage by a madman with a gun which was the last thing she was expecting
8196010 without giving too much away he wants to know where someone precious to him is and he wants to know whether it means harming katie or matthew in the process
8196011 it was actually a real gun but it didnt have any ammunition in it its a horrible feeling having it pointed at your head

8196024 we believe that heinekens first half results are not as bad as feared given a strong top line the outlook for 2008 is very cautious though but provides room to over deliver
8196025 these results are more or less in line with expectations although i think the outlook for volumes is somewhat disappointing
8196026 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8196027 we have maintained the momentum of our top line growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment

8196050 by trying to fix the problem through this emissions trading scheme and this mechanism weve managed to get a real gain out of it for both the health and well being of our families but also helping us to save money to at a time food is going up fuel is going up and because were the ones generally tending to the bottom of the income bracket were the ones going to suffer the most
8196051 if youve got the land or assets youve either got to use it or lose it weve seen a lot of maori trusts and incorporations who are doing nothing with their resources because sometime they think thats the safe thing to do whereas often theyre not even generating enough to pay the rates and pay other bills and putting the thing they were trying to protect at risk inadvertently
8196052 branches of rangitane are associated with that range and of course we still have descendants of those groups in our area we will be going in to talks on the composition of a cultural impact report
8196053 will these settlements be successful some of them wont some of them will turn out to be too riushed some of them wont turn out to have the mandate that is expected and you have to be careful because often a settlement is announced when really all that is being announced is an agreement to work towards a settlement
8196054 because all i could see was another 20 25 years of wasted time and arguments and its counterproductive for this country and so yes in that context i have been supportive and ive put a lot of time and so have a lot of my workers put a lot of time into trying to get that unity and weve seen the consequence this year just a short while ago when we got a settlement no one thought was possible at the start of the year 2008

8196057 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8196058 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8196059 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8196060 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let him go

8196062 in an era when schools have limited time budgets and resources webschoolpro websites empower educators with simple tools that encourage and improve communication participation and fundraising efforts
8196063 to succeed our schools teachers and students need and deserve the same technological advantages and opportunities as businesses
8196064 it can be done responsibly so that all parties win there are many appropriate sponsors interested in supporting our education institutions we work closely with schools and advertisers to ensure success for everyone involved
8196065 webschoolpro enables us to immediately share vital information within our district and community

8196074 i like the fact that just when you think youve got billy figured out hell do something that will totally surprise you
8196075 billy has always had this dark side to him its only recently that he has become a family man and thats down to honey
8196076 even though hes the runt in the mitchell litter hes always had this huge chip on his shoulder which i think makes him more dangerous than phil or grant
8196077 despite what they thought i honestly felt there was more mileage for her but seeing as they havent killed her off i guess there is still a chance she could wander back one day
8196078 those scenes were some of my last on the show and i can honestly say that the tears are real
8196079 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8196080 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
8196081 the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8196082 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality
8196083 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8196084 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
8196085 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8196086 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly
8196087 it is going to be very difficult to pull back a two goal deficit especially against this side at home

8196106 working in close partnership with billionaire philanthropist george soros undp moved swiftly speed was recognized as crucial to success even before mr saakashvili was sworn into office undp and mr soross open society institute osi had agreed upon the creation of a new initiative to help the new administration secure the staff and expertise it needed
8196107 now regarding george soross contribution this is primarily undp fund united nations development program fund to fund capacity building for georgian government and george soros will not be the only contributor we said we expect as we already have pledges from a number of other contributions we only have at this moment two million dollars contributed by undp and soros but we have some other pledges we need at least eight million dollars already this year and we will need some more for the next year soros played good role in bolstering democratic processes in georgia he was very instrumental for many ngos in their development and i think there is nothing bad about that wrong about that

8196112 i would be happy to work with darren and he would get the best sparring partners around
8196113 im aware that several american promoters are also anxious to talk to darren but he must be cautious
8196114 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference
8196115 we know the money is important but we are so close to the end of the transfer window it wont make a big difference
8196116 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game

8196121 in the town out of the town i really get tired of all these trips
8196122 the young ones theyre all right its the old ones who have had a drink or two too much yelling at you asking all sorts of questions
8196123 i was at this sports banquet a famous person got up to speak he had too much to drink like james dean in that movie he kept on talking and no one knew how to stop him it was embarrassing ill never be like that
8196124 its getting to be my time now im getting near the end i have had some good times some bad i started out with three bad injuries fractured left ankle left wrist right ankle and am ending with three bad injuries sliced achilles tendon fractured left tibia depressed fracture of facial bone the old days are gone these are the new days ill never score five goals in one night
8196125 when the boys come back they said theyll look after maurice nobody looked after maurice he looked after himself when the boys come back they said theyll catch up with him the only thing thats caught up with maurice is time
8196126 i know im not playing good hockey now im weak now my legs are tired after a minute and a half im tired im so tired i will try to diet i weigh 194 pounds ive been playing at that weight for the last five years but im so heavy im floating on air i got to take off five or six pounds before the playoffs only one beer thats all ill drink ill drink gin that isnt fattening
8196127 i dont believe it i did not deserve it luck
8196128 he kids himself that if hes feeling well hes at the right weight you dont feel well at the right weight youre crabby but he makes so much money richard s salary is estimated at 30 000 hes wonderful to sign
8196129 how much do you want i ask how much do you want to give me he says i always give him a little more than anyone else i hear about through the grapevine he has done so much for the game
8196130 ninety percent of them are educated i know most of the guys i like them i wrestle a lot with boom boom geoffrion in the room do a lot of crazy things
8196131 ive been in hockey 53 years and ive never had an aging athlete admit he was through
8196132 he misses passes he never missed he tops the puck like a golfer he never did that hes got too big in the middle id bench him hed damn well get in shape i wouldnt sign him for another year i wouldnt let him make a fool of himself in front of a crowd
8196133 when a guy is a natural he doesnt have to drive and force himself some guys if howe would work a little harder hed be better
8196134 now hes just a whirlwind half the time but when hes not doing a lot you notice it not like the others
8196135 his eyes gleam like headlights not a glow but a piercing intensity goalies have said hes like a motorcar coming on you at night he is terrifying he is the greatest hockey player that ever lived i can contradict myself by saying that 10 or 15 do the mechanics of play better but its results that count others play well build up eventually get a goal he is like a flash of lightning its a fine summer day suddenly
8196136 you got to give it to the fellow the fellow was fantastic thats why you got to give it to the fellow that will
8196137 ive never seen a man so completely dedicated to the degree he is many people who prosper take prosperity for granted he doesnt to this day he is the best hockey player he can be every second you know he is the eldest of a fairly extensive family raised in relative poverty back of it all somehow or other he was going to lift himself one way or another he has an inner urge to transcend
8196138 i dont believe in anything its nice i like to forget about it i dont think i deserve it thats my whole trouble all the years its just the way it went there are better hockey players but they dont work as hard i like to win
8196139 we were playing toronto once in a benefit softball game
8196140 instead of just using the maple leaf players they used the best softball players they had in their entire organization
8196141 making a farce out of something i dont like to lose they wont forget about me but when they stop writing about you when they stop talking it wont be the same it will be a different life i like to meet people but not to talk about hockey when we had a bad game and lost i stay away from everybody and go home thats why i like fishing to be quiet when im traveling around the provinces i go fly fishing for an hour or two at night hunting is nice too because i like to be in the woods they all talking about you but i dont like it in front of me it feels funny another player they wouldnt have done it but im afraid to let the french people down thats why im worried out before i could work hard follow everybody i dont want to be kept on the ice through sympathy
8196142 there are many cardinals duplessis was only the head man of quebec maurice richard was not only the best of the french but of the english as well he came to epitomize the desire of superiority of the french canadian nationalists he was one of their best expressions but you must understand that he has no personal interest in it maurice richard never did a thing to accentuate it he was a person to fix their eyes here was a demonstration
8196143 i feel funny once i cut my hand as a little kid and i passed out
8196144 his difficulty was the language barrier a very modest formal education and the disparagement of no war service
8196145 there is a feeling that someone is trying to put it over on him he has a tremendous dread of poverty
8196146 but you got to be careful of your adjectives maurice just cant take anything if he could he would not be maurice richard frenzy makes him but there is no meanness in maurice richard hes 100 solid gold someone youd be proud to have as the husband of one of your daughters faithful devoted
8196147 he has been so good he didnt have to do the things others did the time hasnt come when he realizes hes human and has to do the things everyone else does but if he wasnt so obstinate he couldnt have done the things he has done he was watched watched watched until he finally blew there are more sly ways to get at a man with the stick the stick stings you know who gave it to you when he blew he blew good no one could have taken it as long as he did and done less about it
8196148 today they dont have to bother me like before but every fight ive been in every suspension i was not the first im not the type to hit a guy many times i dont like a guy but i get on the ice i forget all about it now its no use to fight ten minutes 25 fine if you keep fighting too long they send you out its a match penalty 100 fine
8196149 you dont prove anything at your age to take on a young buck you win youve won so many fights already you lose theyll say you let a bandy rooster lick the cock of the walk
8196150 at the beginning of my career i didnt know what the english people were talking about even today i like to go somewhere and want to go somewhere but they ask me to make a speech i like to but i am a man of few words
8196151 he used to ride all the way to chicago sitting in the corner he didnt even read a book henri his brother was that way too after henri had been with the club two years a reporter asked the coach if he could interview him sure he said go ahead does he speak english the reporter asked hell said blake i dont even know if he speaks french maurice is just a great company man he shows up for the game does a great job and disappears into his shell
8196152 hes like the lion whos let out of the cage twice a week
8196153 one for each 100 goals if i have to reach the 700 mark ill have to get another one but i think ill have to stop i mean theres no more on the way yet my oldest is huguette she is 16 and studying to be a beautician all she does now is ski she doesnt do her skating anymore id like to do figure skating too but im embarrassed then there is maurice jr who is 14 hes good at school not too bad hes a fair hockey player right wing he wants to play hockey too he is an inch and a half taller than me normand is 9 this one is the one that likes every sport a right wing too hes a natural just fair in school then andr who is 5 he is starting to go to school this year hes kind of young but hes all right suzanne is 2 and paul we call him paulu is one my wife lucille has missed only two hockey games in 18 years she was sick for a week this year
8196154 because of the exploitation i have fans but no clubs instead of the kids spending money on us let us spend money on them
8196155 the kids all call this one place where we skate maurice richard park
8196156 thats not the real name in montreal most of the people things are named after are dead people parents should spend more time watching their kids play
8196157 i come out after the game starts and stand hidden in a corner i like to play with them in the park the kids get such a kick out of it they talk of nothing else for a week afterward
8196158 i keep them and stay with them all the time
8196159 the wife and i were swimming 50 or 60 feet offshore
8196160 fish of all different colors came around us and touched our legs

8196238 star dobr asy v znamen origin lnych hier ktor sa
8196239 we cover everything from domestic blockage to industrial factories and do cleaning and repairs of drains ive grown up in the business it was my father who started it its a pretty interesting role
8196240 no two days are the same we could be in a vets practice getting a cat out of a drain and then the next day be jumping out of a helicopter on to an offshore oil platform
8196241 we do see a lot of human waste but dont come into contact with it the days of getting dirty are really gone because of health and safety everyone wears protective clothing
8196242 we have worked on drains that come out of hospitals and mortuaries and seen things like fingers in drains though
8196243 the thought of it is a bit weird but i love the satisfaction of making people feel so good afterwards they feel so light and clean
8196244 the waste goes away through a sealed tube so there is no noise or smells first of all i find out whats going on with their bowel they dont have to bring a sample im not gillian mckeith but i ask them questions about things like how often they go to the toilet
8196245 then i gently insert a speculum into the rectum it only goes a tiny way in and we have a mirror set up so that people can see what is going away which is fascinating you can see gas bubbles which are all the little trumps going along the tube and little specks which are spices we get a lot of sweetcorn and mushrooms as well
8196246 the weirdest things ive found are a little plastic shoe for a barbie doll which a lady had swallowed as a child and another lady had a glass bead from a necklace her mother remembered the necklace from years before but couldnt remember what had happened to it
8196247 there are occasions when there are children involved or when somebody who has died before their time when it is particularly sad and i have stood with families and cried im not afraid to admit it
8196248 ive been out to murder scenes and road accidents too
8196249 the hardest thing is doing funerals for friends and family i have done quite a number over the years when you are dealing with your own its without a doubt the worst part you cant deal with it with the same detachment
8196250 there are a lot of personal rewards in being able to help people through the most difficult time in their lives and being there to guide and support them
8196251 when people arrange a funeral you tend to do some counselling as a matter of course as well as helping them to arrange flowers and catering
8196252 i have made a lot of very good friends in this way
8196253 i am not a great lover of doing anything where there is a flea infestation and you walk in and wake them up they want to feed and will do
8196254 my friends and family dont like me talking about my work at the dinner table but im not squeamish at all
8196255 i do enjoy doing wasps nests in particular i get a hit out of doing it its hard to explain
8196256 you cant really be squeamish in this job you have got to see some nasty things at times and there is always a lot of blood ive been vomited over by a few patients but its not their fault they are not well
8196257 if you go home at the end of the day and know you have figured out whats wrong with them and made them feel better its a great feeling
8196258 there are 14 patients between two members of staff and we are responsible for feeding them washing them dressing them and helping them go to the toilet everybody has to do those things and it is always satisfying to be able to give them a hand they are glad to have some help

8196264 come and have a go if you think youre hard enough
8196265 what worries me is the fact that the present clampdown by chinese officials needs to be actively removed post olympics
8196266 however it is always easier to give power than it is to take it away especially when you are talking about security and intelligence forces
8196267 you would expect beijing will be keen to continue to show off to the world after the olympics and will therefore be keen to keep the tourists coming in
8196268 maybe they will use the olympics as a way to leverage their country to attract consumers and corporations
8196269 skechers brown shoe ugg nike reebok and everyone under the sun believes in the market
8196270 they wouldnt commit this level of capital if they didnt

8196296 at the end of this decade in the year 1980 the united states will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our jobs to heat our homes and to keep our transportation moving
8196297 the democrats energy record is one of empty rhetoric and broken promises
8196298 and thats why they have no credibility with the american people
8196299 its no secret that the manufacturers need all the support they can get right now and i think this is a really good strategic move in that direction

8196307 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8196308 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8196309 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8196310 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times

8196331 airport retail is growing very quickly and the image is also changing
8196332 the market is shifting from a main category like tobacco alcohol and cosmetics to a more brand oriented shopping experience with full boutiques and personalized shop in shop corners
8196333 youve got money youre going on holiday and you have time to spare you can buy an ipod or a montblanc pen or a hugo boss shirt
8196334 we play with the traffic play with the mix from morning to evening depending on the flight destination
8196335 if theres a far eastern flight in the morning we put the higher end out front if its european or domestic in the evening we may have more high fashion and fast fashion more womens
8196336 beijing terminal 3 has the most luxurious domestic mix that ive seen anywhere in the world with brands such as omega which is not normal in the domestic market
8196337 the chinese are a massive market those brands have to work hard to be the preferred brand theyre using shops in domestic terminals as 3 d advertisements
8196338 our airport locations act as virtual ambassadors for the brand
8196339 our strategy is to open boutiques in the case where the airport shopping area doesnt allow full size boutiques we ask for a personalized shop in shop or a corner
8196340 our strategy is to expand our airport presence aggressively but with an emphasis on quality meaning fully branded standalone stores versus quantity
8196341 airport development is central not just to our global retail strategy but is a significant part of our overall brand strategy for the next several years
8196342 indias own domestic middle class has been growing at a phenomenal rate but the quality and amount of retail downtown never caught up
8196343 private entities bought both airports so the whole face of indian airport travel will be transformed
8196344 well have a design area dedicated to craft with indian retailers it will be different from what you see in the rest of the world youll see the richness of a culture through its retailers
8196345 the luxury concentration is not a problem for sales but it might be in the future because if you replicate the same names worldwide theres no sense of difference
8196346 not everybody can afford to walk into gucci and drop 2 000 on a handbag
8196347 seventy five percent of the people who visit airports only buy a newspaper and a cup of coffee
8196348 were seeing relatively single digit growth not 10 to 20 percent but t5 represents a new store and a new business for us london is a pretty cool international destination were benefiting from that

8196444 there is no way in hell he should have been deployed the army saw him as just another set of boots on the ground
8196445 from the second tour on he changed 180 degrees three deployments is two too many the army took my husband from me the army destroyed my husband
8196446 army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families
8196447 there appears to be a direct relationship between the incidence of suicide and the number of deployments which of course is no surprise
8196448 the army is making great strides in treating soldiers with post traumatic psychological symptoms as well as decreasing the stigma associated with treatment for these symptoms
8196449 were not here to make you better were here to make you deployable
8196450 everyone treats you like crap theres a huge stigma to asking for help
8196451 but the real problem is the ptsd the real problem is the mental health condition
8196452 now making them better may mean taking them from a non deployable to a deployable status obviously theres a war going on but the goal is making them better

8196471 these problems require earnest reflection to build courage from shame and to make up lost ground
8196472 as soon as we step off the podium everything starts from zero
8196473 as more medications are approved for market each year and become available to americans the opportunity for potentially dangerous or even deadly errors due to drug mix ups from look alike or sound alike names becomes increasingly high
8196474 while one drug name may be nearly identical to that of another drug the two could be used for completely different conditions this presents a major public health threat and we think this new tool can play an important role in helping to reduce patient risk associated with this problem
8196475 as one can imagine for someone with hypertension receiving the wrong medication could present a potentially severe consequence
8196476 this is exactly the type of mix up we think could be avoided through tools such as our drug error finder this may be useful to parties across the health care system who are involved in dispensing and administering medications and especially to caregivers and to patients who should always remain vigilant and participate actively in their care

8196486 the minutes of the last us federal reserve meeting contained no big surprises a majority of members anticipated that the next move would be a hike but they did not see rates as particularly accommodative all the same that is largely due to money markets stresses and increased risk premia for bank lending to consumers and businesses we still think that there is little chance of a hike in h2 because the us will be in or perilously closer to recession yet unless conditions deteriorate markedly in the financial system a cut is off the table too there are still inflation sceptics on the federal open market committee fomc some think that the elevated level of headline inflation has the potential to spur second round effects they also fret about inflation expectations becoming unmoored and that energy prices may resume their upward march we are unconvinced about all three arguments workers have little bargaining power in a weakening labour market so inflation chasing wage hikes are very hard to secure meanwhile pricing power for businesses is diminishing in an economy operating well below trend equally there is scant evidence of rising inflation expectations at least on market based measures in fact they have fallen sharply recently we think that the decline in commodity prices will bring survey based measures down too and we anticipate a further drop in commodity prices from here as tighter credit causes growth to slow globally

8196489 we are clear you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
8196490 if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here in october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009
8196491 i wonder if you can get specific about where this dysfunction lies my understanding is that there were 43 confidence votes in the last parliamentary session and you survived every one
8196492 the procedure has to be government to government the ministry of foreign affairs must now begin to take up that discussion with the chinese with whom i have had my own discussions and arrived at the funding that relates to the process of the railways implementation and as soon as i have the response of the ministry of finance it will be going to cabinet for them to accept my position hopefully
8196493 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8196494 the reason we did that is because it is very important first of all i think that downtown is comprised of more than one kind of building in the environment that incorporates the center of downtown the classic small town americana
8196495 it is one and two and three story buildings with sidewalk and storefronts and office space above that is essential to the downtown experience we created a concept for sustaining that growing downtown area
8196496 this is so conceptual it could be a lot of different scenarios
8196497 i like to think we could go through soon but theres property acquisition involved theres property assemblage all that takes time we dont know exactly how well acquire properties and when it will be tif eligible for this development or are there going to be their own specific redevelopment agreements themselves or if we establish a business district for some of the commercial areas to help pay for the redevelopment cost so there are a lot scenarios that we are going to have to deal with and work with individually with developers to help promote development
8196498 we came up with the market district improvements to illinois 159 working with idot to see what unique opportunities we could have
8196499 the market district is a great place to put a large retailer in like a minigrocer no wal marts or targets but smaller 20 000 square foot or 30 000 square foot developments its a tremendous amenity for downtown collinsville

8196606 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error
8196607 but first of all i cannot understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race they have all the information that is needed to make a judgment during the grand prix
8196608 as far as i know nobodys made any announcements or decisions about retiring
8196609 the main thing if a guy is going back that he has the hunger for it but that goes for everybody theres no reason then why he cant go back
8196610 will i be back the key is to make sure you have the hunger if you dont you see what happened to us against kilkenny and youre not doing anyone justice or yourself justice if you dont have that hunger
8196611 you must have that hunger fellas talk about the summer but the tough time is during the winter and preparing for it and im no different maybe i have to test myself this winter to see if i have that hunger
8196612 during the summer youre not training as much you rest between games its during the winter you have the serious training guys know themselves they know if they have it or if they dont
8196613 there were certain situations we were in this year and the lads showed great character but as with all other teams if you dont win the all ireland you look back on the year as a failure thats what makes sport at this level tough
8196614 its up to gerald and hell know what he wants to do himself
8196615 any manager coming into a setup that we had from 2003 to 2006 there are going to be issues as the new man has new ideas setanta readers comment of the day yes but refs have to be given power to stamp it out
8196616 im a hurling person but its great to see the footballers there
8196617 we brought the three of them in last year for the intermediate hurlers and i wanted them for the seniors this year and i thought id get them in
8196618 but there was a conflict between hurling and football with obyrne and walsh cup pre season games and the problem arises when you have fellas wanted by both panels its impossible now to manage a lad at both levels but id love to have brian red barry lyng and rory stafford
8196619 cork would have fellas like that too good dual players and its no coincidence the counties going for three in a row kerry and kilkenny are one code counties
8196620 hillary should wear versace a dress not trousers she doesnt need to wear trousers to show shes strong

8196622 there is a strong probability that the affair will sort itself out before the end of the week
8196623 elfsborg were beaten 2 0 the other night but that result doesnt matter and our result against sligo rovers doesnt matter either
8196624 they are a very good side and just watching them in the first half against us their movement was fantastic
8196625 thursday will be a massive night at richmond park but by no means do i think well be favourites
8196626 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8196627 they draw near to me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they teach for doctrines the commandments of men having a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof now lets break this down concept by concept and focus on the key words in each concept focusing on what the words themselves actually mean at their most basic level rather than secondary definitions and other interpretations that have been postulated both within and without the mormon church must join none of them
8196628 and the personage who addressed me said that all their
8196629 an authoritative formulated statement of the chief articles of christian belief
8196630 the christian creeds are an abomination and they taint all those who profess them
8196631 well i actually really like the corn and mayonnaise pizza
8196632 after finishing the repair work on the main road we are now concentrating on the link roads
8196633 this time there were heavy rains in may june july and august those severely hit were the farmers whether it is the fruit growers or the vegetable growers transport has also been adversely affected

8196636 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just
8196637 for me its been a privilege to meet you in your homes your workplaces and your communities your stories reminded me everyday that americas greatness is bound up in the lives of the american people your hard work your devotion to duty your love for your children and your determination to keep going often in the face of enormous obstacles you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8196638 when we look around today we see that for too many americans that fair shot is becoming more of a long shot how many kids have the grades to go to college but not the money how many families thought their home would always be their safest investment how many of our soldiers come back from their second or third tour of duty wondering if the education and health care benefits they were promised will actually be there two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them
8196639 from the single mom in rural appalachia who wants to move from welfare to business ownership to the latino in the barrio who is making minimum wage but wants to be an entrepreneur to the african american business owner here in denver who can barely make ends meet these people cant afford more of the same from john mccain
8196640 everywhere barack went people who may have been asking who this guy was ended up seeing what i saw a husband a father of two daughters and a man of deep faith everywhere we went the people of pennsylvania gave him the highest praise they give anyone hes one of us too and pennsylvania couldnt be prouder of our native son joe biden from scranton no one knows us better than joe after eight years of a president who lets the oil companies and the washington lobbyists call the shots i say its about time we had a president and vice president who really know us
8196641 you know president bush inherited the strongest economy in history and a huge budget surplus
8196642 the results of the republican energy policy are plain back then the price of gas at the pump was about 1 50 a gallon today its 4 a gallon back then it cost about 900 to heat your home through the winter this winter its more likely to be 2 500 meanwhile exxonmobil just announced the largest quarterly profit in history thats not just an outrage its obscene
8196643 wake up america we went into iraq for oil the oil companies want more war against iran will mean 10 a gallon gasoline the oil administration wants to drill more into your wallet wake up america weapons contractors want more an iran war will cost 5 to 10 trillion dollars this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit they can open our mail they cant open economic opportunities they can track our every move they lost track of the economy while the cost of food gasoline and electricity skyrockets
8196644 i knew stephanie tubbs jones as a constant voice for justice and peace she was known to others for her work as a prosecutor a judge and chairwoman of the ethics committee of the house of representatives she was a stalwart democrat a real leader and an enthusiastic supporter of hillary rodham clintons bid for the nomination after senator obama prevailed the congressional black caucus met with senator obama and stephanie tubbs jones led us in standing rock solid in support of him as our candidate for president she knew the importance of making sure that every vote counts and every vote is counted
8196645 for the last eight years the big oil companies and their washington lobbyists have literally written our national energy policies they have made billions while the rest of us are stuck paying the bill now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8196646 i live on a dirt road in a town of 1 800 in vermont i know rural america vermont is proud to be part of rural america but like communities across the heartland we are struggling from eight years of the bush cheney economy rural communities face disproportionately high unemployment rates violent crime is up and no one is hurt by record high energy prices more than we are finally after eight years of failed policies and misplaced priorities we can turn the page rural america cant afford more of the same

8196714 en el plan plurianual no estaban inclu an obras para la ciudad de r o grande
8196715 nos dijo el ministro daniel l pez que era propuesta del ejecutivo con dinero del ejecutivo pero con el intercambio de opiniones se acord que se fijaran las prioridades de cada ciudad es la primera reuni n que participamos y estamos escuchando a las opiniones
8196716 en una reuni n no nos invitan en la siguiente nos llega tarde la invitaci n y en la otra nos dicen que no estamos en el presupuesto porque no presentamos nada pero no hay que darle trascendencia a esto porque son chicanas que se hacen en este tipo de reuni n que proviene de partidos que tienen dificultades para gobernar y buscan endilgar las responsabilidades a otros
8196717 el viernes acercaremos las necesidades de la ciudad de r o grande que ha venido llevando adelante el municipio pero parece que algunos del consejo desconocen
8196718 manifestaron que era producto de que el municipio no hab a enviado nada pero no se puede enviar donde no se solicitan y entendemos que el gobierno debe analizar las situaciones de ambas ciudades pero vemos que en gran medida responde a una actitud pol tica de la comuna riograndense al no compartir algunos criterios por ah est muy bien analizada ushuaia donde el gobierno tiene m s incidencia en la prestaci n de servicios y no as r o grande
8196719 el viernes acercaremos las necesidades de la ciudad de r o grande que ha venido llevando adelante el municipio pero parece que algunos del consejo desconocen
8196720 es un disparador en cuanto a la ptica que desde el estado provincial se tiene pero considerando que no estaban totalmente incorporadas aquellas obras de infraestructura que dependen de otros organismos como los municipios o los entes aut rquicos indudablemente esto sirvi como disparador y se est re evaluando el plan plurianual de obras
8196721 la intenci n es que los consejeros para el d a viernes que ser la pr xima sesi n del consejo puedan tener un panorama claro de las prioridades b sicas de desarrollo de obra en funci n de lo que est n aportando los municipios y los entes aut rquicos
8196722 nosotros como ministerio de obras p blicas generamos el debate de este tema y efectivamente el municipio ha puesto a disposici n de los consejeros su plan de obras y su perspectiva de crecimiento de ciudad y las obras de infraestructura necesarias para poder acompa ar ese desarrollo y crecimiento
8196723 si todos los que participamos estamos haciendo el esfuerzo de sumarnos es realmente para que los beneficios sean de la sociedad en su conjunto
8196724 creo que no tenemos que estar midiendo si hay una obra m s o menos en una ciudad pero de todos modos cuando se termine con la priorizaci n del plan de obras habr que darle la equidad que tiene que tener y hacer inversiones similares en las tres ciudades pero tenemos que tratar de estar a la altura de las circunstancias

8196752 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his v p pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers

8196758 we are exporting our shawls throughout and the major portion is middle east france australia japan usa and lot many other countries i think the overall production growth which was 500 crore rupees earlier has now crossed that figure its much more than that

8196784 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8196785 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8196786 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8196787 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8196788 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8196789 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
8196790 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8196791 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
8196792 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago

8196804 after 2001 musharraf was expediently billed as the saviour who could save the economy align pakistan with the west stop terrorism and rid the country of tainted politics this was myth masquerading as fact in a place where everything including nuclear technology was for sale
8196805 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know

8196861 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8196862 consumers in mature markets continued to favour mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation despite this we remain positive that mobile phone sales in 2008 will reach 1 28 billion units
8196863 we expect samsungs sales to remain strong in the second half of 2008 as new products such as the omnia pick up momentum
8196864 our confidence in an improved performance by sony ericsson weakened further as recent product announcements were disappointing since they delivered similar current features and designs
8196865 net new cellular connections declined significantly operators added more than 83 million connections in the first quarter of 2008 but they added only 75 million in the second quarter of 2008 this drop negatively impacted sales of mobile devices in the second quarter of 2008
8196866 in addition high food prices and inflation also had a negative impact on sales of replacement mobile handsets
8196867 the economy in several countries has slowed down and the region saw slower than expected replacement sales as consumers dealt with the higher cost of living despite these unfavourable conditions operators and handset vendors continue to target areas with low penetration in the commonwealth of independent states and west africa
8196868 this drop is twice as much as last quarter and it was the result of a lack of new phone features that were compelling enough to drive growth
8196869 the performance this quarter was below expectations mainly due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 and slightly weaker demand in the second quarter of 2008 generating higher levels of inventory as vendors did not fully materialise sales
8196870 despite industry concerns over the economic downturn handset sales were strong up 5 3 quarter on quarter
8196871 new subscribers were limited during the quarter as growth continued to be dominated by replacement sales
8196872 however the market was up 16 percent quarter on quarter the region reached a penetration rate of 121 5 per cent in the first half of 2008 demonstrating that there is a strong dependence on replacement sales as a driver in this market
8196873 economic conditions remained challenging during the quarter although some vendors and operators felt this more than others with sony ericsson continuing to feel the strain and vodafone sales being affected by delays in new devices availability and slower replacement sales
8196874 we expect mobile handset sales to exhibit 11 per cent growth in 2008 and the growth in revenue will be slightly lower at 9 percent as increased competition and a tougher economic environment negatively impact average selling prices in addition mobile phone manufacturers will be put under pressure to maintain healthy margins while they intend to further break through the emerging markets to increase sales

8197023 twenty or thirty of the kids were building a barricade they brought in park benches and picnic tables and ran it a distance of fifty feet then a hundred feet
8197024 the way it should be worked is that the police officer decides a person is going too fast for the conditions then uses the radar gun to check what speed theyre doing
8197025 then they can produce evidence to prosecute them for that you cant do that from 3000 feet
8197026 thats not an effective use of the helicopter but officers are in it every time its up so if they spot something its absolutely right that they should act
8197027 its a very good deterrent a lot of the time with speeding what you are doing is deterring people not catching them
8197028 they were a ragtag collection of racist rednecks armed with guns methamphetamines and hatred of the idea of a black president

8197044 last night was the first time i had attended a playreading and just wanted to say wow on so many levels ian hughess talent is mesmerising both acting and writing it was great to learn about the processes behind the scenes also i took 2 friends along who have never been to any auckland theatre company productions they were blown away thank you for the opportunity
8197045 atcs literary unit helped me transform where we once belonged from my lumpy over written first draft into a highly successful and popular festival play through their script development process atcs literary unit shows that if theatres encourage and develop playwrights early on then they reap the benefits when these same playwrights become successful
8197046 the atc literary unit does invaluable necessary work which continues to foster and support new zealand talent after a not inconsiderable amount of time being stuck in the darkness with my play my name is gary cooper the atc workshop helped me see one of the most beautiful things a writer can ever hope to see light at the end of the tunnel faafetai lava
8197047 dr francis nii annan sowah is seriously disadvantaged by the condition of his health and cannot possibly win the parliamentary seat we so cherish to regain
8197048 the parliamentary candidate who was elected at an extraordinary delegates conference on august 25 2007 over a year ago has been gravely indisposed for a couple of months and is incapable of standing the heat of active electioneering campaign and since he was discharged from the hospital about two months ago he has not officially visited the constituency since he is under an intense physiotherapy care
8197049 prior to his illness he distanced himself from core party activities and does not liaise with the executive on any issue virtually bringing the campaign to a standstill
8197050 he operates scantily with self appointed assistants as if he were an independent candidate and information gathered within the constituency is that the parliamentary candidate has very limited or no resources to fund any serious and active campaign
8197051 it has a certain quiet elegance to it that is timeless and never quite goes out of style

8197077 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family
8197078 this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possible play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 per cent and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8197079 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8197080 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8197081 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8197082 in one day cricket if a top order batsman stays in until the 30th over there is almost a certainty he will score a hundred
8197083 that is the kind of attitude that top order players should carry into a match
8197084 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8197085 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8197086 i think when you see something thats morally offensive you have every right to call it what it is and you have every right to call on your opponent to say tell your people to stop this because you know where this is coming from
8197087 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8197088 i think you have to focus on what the american people need
8197089 i dont believe they need to go down the negative road

8197096 we suspect the cause of these insect bites is itch mites which inhabit in tree leaves
8197097 the mites cannot be seen and the bites are not felt but leave an itchy red mark that can resemble a skin rash
8197098 the bites are described as having tiny scabs in the center of a reddened area sometimes extending 3 to 4 centimeters

8197110 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8197111 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8197112 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8197113 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8197114 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
8197115 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

8197118 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8197119 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8197120 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book
8197121 handsomely reconstituted by new directions from the scarce original editions the unfortunates comes in a box of 27 unbound chapters
8197122 the young cartoonist dash shaw comes down firmly on the symbolic end of the comics continuum
8197123 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8197124 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen
8197125 then there were wigs max persuaded cecil b de mille in town to direct the large scale western the squaw man that wigs and hairpieces painstakingly formed of real human hair 135 168 individually knotted strands went into an average max factor wig
8197126 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8197127 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
8197128 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8197129 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly
8197130 it is going to be very difficult to pull back a two goal deficit especially against this side at home
8197131 but after the last game the players had a lot of belief that they could compete
8197132 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference
8197133 we know the money is important but we are so close to the end of the transfer window it wont make a big difference
8197134 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game

8197136 an investigative report based on the practical workings of the industry supported by up to date data
8197137 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8197138 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8197139 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8197140 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8197141 het bankieren in een dergelijke omgeving vereist de nodige voorzichtigheid en terughoudendheid
8197142 lastiger dan ooit om in de huidige marktomstandigheden concrete uitspraken te doen over het te verwachten resultaat in de tweede jaarhelft
8197143 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8197144 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8197145 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8197146 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8197147 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8197148 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8197149 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8197150 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8197151 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8197152 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8197153 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8197154 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8197155 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8197156 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8197157 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8197158 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8197159 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8197160 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8197161 who are open to doing something on the production side
8197162 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8197163 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8197164 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8197165 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8197166 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8197167 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8197168 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8197169 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8197170 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8197171 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8197172 i filed this action at this time to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
8197173 if he was born in hawaii and he was adopted in indonesia by lolo soetoro obama would lose his citizenship

8197186 i want the reputation of the university of washington to be that were excited about doing business with the investment community
8197187 if the uw can commercialize the research we do here theres a tremendous opportunity to bring tremendous revenue to the university produce many many jobs and bring innovations into the world that can help people
8197188 we want to get our ideas out through patents licenses startups or papers and grants we realize the important role technology transfer can play we want to make sure were taking advantage of every opportunity
8197189 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8197190 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8197191 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8197192 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8197193 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8197194 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8197195 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8197196 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8197197 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8197198 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8197199 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8197200 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8197201 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8197202 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8197203 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8197204 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8197205 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8197206 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8197207 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8197208 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8197231 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8197232 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8197233 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8197234 first for patients with type 1 diabetes telehealth can help clinicians to better understand a patients insulin usage and enable appropriate medication titration
8197235 second post diagnosis of type 2 diabetes two to three months of telehealth can help to educate patients about their condition and any lifestyle changes they may need to make
8197236 and third for all diabetes patients telehealth can serve as a long term reminder system for patients to monitor their blood sugar
8197237 a broader application of such telehealth programmes would help provide a higher quality of diabetes care
8197238 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8197239 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8197240 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8197241 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8197242 may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8197243 the secretary general regrets that ongoing efforts to find a common solution within the security council may be complicated
8197244 contrary to the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
8197245 in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
8197246 all responsible people should support russia so as to put an end to the unilateral influence in the world of the us and the eu
8197247 ukraine should respect the will of the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia
8197248 some people are frivolously playing with fire on all sides
8197249 for this very reason we in the west should not react unwisely
8197250 to be driven by ones emotions at this point would be wrong we must stop the virus of separation and war infecting other areas
8197251 the conflict in the caucasus is in danger of escalating further if we are not careful the whole security apparatus in europe will be unhinged with unpredictable consequences for us all
8197252 we will not solve conflicts if we do not talk to each other

8197269 i feel that way too let us bury our past
8197270 when my men come i will tell them to attend to you first that will show everyone a beginning of a new friendship

8197277 the housing market is in the tubes people are giving their cars away and people are not spending money
8197278 those three categories close to 80 percent of our revenue are flat and negative

8197280 i think thats going to be a game time decision
8197281 whether he starts or not depends on this week of practice
8197282 the thing we want to do as a staff is be fair if a guy is playing well were not immediately going to move the other guy back in and say hey youre going to start
8197283 ive been doing it for what 20 some practices now so it should be good
8197284 well pack a toothbrush and a comb and thats about it
8197285 all we have to do is stay on eastern time and it will be like playing an 8 00 game for us
8197286 hopefully it wont have too much of an affect i really doubt it once game time comes we are all focused in on the game not necessarily the time
8197287 if we want to be successful this year we have to beat cal there are no ifs ands or buts about it we need to beat cal we need to beat cal
8197288 but that is something we will deal with later but our focus is beating cal right now we have business to take care of with cal
8197289 hoyer is solid he is a quarterback that looks like he continues to get better and better

8197291 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
8197292 if you forecast the difference over the childs 18 years the government could be looking at a shortfall of over 97 million 3 a year for newborn babies if the point of ctfs is to give children a good financial start in life it seems short sighted of the government to hinder the investment potential of future generations we would urge the government to reconsider the limits and keep them in line with inflation so that every child has a fair and equal starting point for their investments
8197293 that blog is now devoid of all posts except one shes a smart right winger she knows to hide the evidence and there was tons on that blog that showed she was one crazy jesus freak bitch bloggers like
8197294 i had a good friend named mary ellen who ran a blog called the divine democrat in the city of chicago then the democratic primaries began and mary ellen an avid hillary supporter began to unabashedly slam barack obama in every possible way imaginable her attacks were not based in facts and she seemed nearly mad in her determination to eliminate him from contention while the rest of us came together after barack clinched the nomination her rage only grew larger she disappeared and her blog went blank until recently when she reappeared

8197344 louisiana monroe is a football team thats gotten much better over the years
8197345 they run a little bit of the spread i dont think they run as much fast tempo as we run but theyve got a quarterback thats athletic they have a lot of starters back and they have a very fast player on their football team that they move and put in certain situations and im sure theyre coming in here knowing that theyve played in this league before and theyve been successful and theyre coming in to play as well as they possibly can and were going to do the same thing so it should be a good game
8197346 we felt like we needed to go back and look at the little things that we were doing
8197347 and i think a lot of times you look at your inexperienced players and you work with them a lot and you look at some of the possible weaknesses you might have and you dont work enough on your strengths because they can always get better and thats really what weve done these last two weeks
8197348 after we got everybody in camp and got everybody in their right positions weve really worked hard on trying to make our experienced players better and the guys that have been around and trying to make the football team better i think that we even got a lot of room for improvement there but its very important that we all as a team play well but we do understand that weve got some younger players were going to be playing
8197349 im one of those that i like definite things i like to as a coach know where our hat is going to be hung so to speak and this is pretty unique to all of us even coach franklin he probably told you the same thing

8197352 late payment is on the rise according to our research with more than half of respondents saying it has become more of a problem over the last 12 months
8197353 the government should be doing more both by paying on time itself and by implementing measures to tackle the problem without increasing the burden of legislation faced by small firms
8197354 the research shows that worrying trends are emerging supplier abuse appears to be widespread and many smaller firms are in a catch 22 situation fearing that if they take action and use the legislation to charge interest these larger companies will simply refuse to deal with them again
8197355 a change to contractual terms cannot be made unilaterally this is a simple matter of contract law

8197397 community based midwives from liverpool womens hospital will be using nortel secure portable office with hospital provided laptops 3g wireless data cards and nortel to securely access review and update server based medical records from patient homes
8197398 our midwives must keep up with complex and changing procedures to ensure the very best patient care
8197399 having a simple solution that allows them to do their jobs securely without having to learn complex log in and operating procedures is a real plus

8197406 todays developments may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8197407 the secretary general regrets that ongoing efforts to find a common solution on the way forward on the crisis in georgia within the security council may be complicated
8197408 on august 12 president dmitry medvedev and president nicolas sarkozy announced the six principles which contained a direct reference to the starting of international discussions on the status of abkhazia and south ossetia then it was dropped
8197409 so they were the ones who immediately started walking away from this i think diplomatic opportunity
8197410 that has created a certain dynamic and weve been warning about that since the unilateral declaration of independence of kosovo came on the horizon
8197411 we have been warning that it is providing additional emphasis to all those who are working for their independence
8197412 i personally believe that abkhazia and south ossetia have many more reasons and much better legal ground for their independence than kosovo so they have a much stronger case
8197413 it has no impact on the internationally established borders of georgia and will not change in any way the international communitys stand on the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia obviously the russian federation has through this senseless act eliminated itself as a viable peacekeeper for this conflict
8197414 if these actions are now accepted by the international community it will mean that foreign forces and groups around the world can use violence and ethnic cleansing to achieve their aims and be rewarded with independence
8197415 that means that third parties can arm sustain and direct those groups in order to change the boundaries on the worlds map this is unacceptable to georgia
8197416 when we have an aggressor state as a permanent member of the security council it is very hard to envisage any meaningful outcome or action at the security council
8197417 in that regard i am going to have a meeting today august 26 with un secretary general ban ki moon i am in constant consultation with the other permanent members of the security council and these consultations will determine which way we are going to go
8197418 it is very common to get just two nurses attending to a crowded ward in the hospital because the clients are too many and the hospital now serves people from neighbouring south sudan
8197419 drugs to treat mental illness are so expensive yet our target should be to extend services to the villages
8197420 few medical staff and limited drugs for the patients made most people resort to other means like traditional herbs which are not the best alternative for most illnesses
8197421 most people are resorting to drastic steps like abusing drugs to help them to forget but that only renders temporary therapy
8197422 70 7 per cent of war abducted children have been affected compared to 45 7 per cent of children who were not abducted
8197423 they recall what they witnessed in the course of the lra war
8197424 these memories preoccupy them so much that they cannot perform well in class
8197425 i cry each and every moment i think about them
8197426 the formal health sector alone is not sufficient to meet their needs
8197427 mental disorders for example developmental disabilities are risk factors for poor learning underachievement and school drop out
8197428 vulnerable children orphans former child soldiers and street children have increased rates of mental illness and educational failure
8197429 photographers had created the very fear they thought they were simply recording
8197430 most children and adolescents will regain normal functioning once basic survival needs are met safety and security have returned and development opportunities are restored within the social family and community context
8197431 some children will require more specialised interventions to address their suffering and help restore their flow of development
8197432 there has been understaffing under funding and non prioritisation in the ugandan mental health sector
8197433 many ngos flocked to northern uganda with the agenda of giving solutions to the increasing cases of mental sicknesses but they ended up giving social support without psycho social support
8197434 during the conflict people were traumatised at varying degrees they should be guided to make good use of the services available at the mental health unit
8197435 to solve mental problems there should be a special attention and provision of services because it is not only the internally displaced who are affected but the entire community in the northern region
8197436 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
8197437 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
8197438 i thought this was an interesting graph the blue line is the 5 yr swap spread and the red line is the vix credit investors are getting very nervous while equity investors are mostly whistling dixie it looks like a variation on the jaws of death that youve mentioned to me before
8197439 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8197440 can survive three hours outside someone s nose if it gets on your fingers and you rub your nose you ve caught it
8197441 the card says more than this but with this kind of longevity no wonder we all catch colds
8197442 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8197443 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
8197444 why does your belief that he went to a muslim school have more influence over your vote than the issues
8197445 im not a muslim not that theres anything wrong with that
8197446 its not that hes a muslim its more that he apparently feels the need to hide it
8197447 anyway if possible you should burn your computer after watching this that is all

8197450 i will not vote for mccain but he obama has a lot to prove to me in two months or i wont be voting
8197451 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8197452 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8197453 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8197454 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8197455 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8197456 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8197457 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8197458 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8197459 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8197460 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8197461 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8197462 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8197463 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later

8197498 mrs gloria macapagal arroyo would do anything to get her hands on meralco whether through the powers of malaca ang through her husband or just about any official at her disposal
8197499 the power sector is a very strategic industry and if mrs arroyo gets control over meralco it will be very easy for her to stay in power and to hostage her political enemies by using meralco as a blackmailing tool what is outrageous is that she is using the government employees fund to wrest control of the utility firm and that is something we will never allow

8197517 investors are finding it hard to find reasons to get into the dollar and chase this move further right now
8197518 as the government and the military forces barrage the people with anti milf war propaganda we must remember how all these came about and must look into the main issues at hand the conflict was instigated and masterminded by arroyo and her gang of warmongerers by dangling a moa memorandum of agreement which while containing some provisions granting the bangsamoro right to self determination was set up and was calculated to fail
8197519 arroyo toyed with an extremely sensitive and volatile peace process for her own selfish ends she opportunistically used the talks as pretext for term extension and charter change as well as to deflect the issues of economic hardships and rising prices being blamed at her refusal to lift the vat value added tax now her government with right wing generals at the helm is stoking the conflict further with its recent pronouncements
8197520 the government surely is aware of these mechanisms and they know very well that the milf leadership will not surrender their commanders however it is using the so called pursuit operations as false pretext to push for more military offensives
8197521 the problem is that the government to begin with has never been sincere in talking peace it is only interested in using the talks for deception and for the surrender of the other side which is not a very good framework if it genuinely wants to address the roots of the armed conflict
8197522 we believe that the present downturn in the residential real estate market has set the stage for abundant investment opportunities throughout the southeast

8197550 this closure has likely helped limit strandings of adult kemps ridley turtles and increase nesting on the south texas coast
8197551 reduced trawling whether its due to high fuel costs low shrimp prices at the dock or regulatory restrictions does correlate to less by catch juvenile red snapper have increased in recent years and one reason for this is less trawling effort
8197552 this closure has improved sea turtle nesting recreational fishing and shrimp harvests making the case for extending the south texas shrimping closure to 12 months and for extending this five nautical mile shrimping closure to the entire texas coast
8197553 these nesters and their offspring like their counterparts at padre island national seashore and south padre island deserve the same protection of a five nautical mile no shrimping zone just like the south texas closure provides
8197554 in water research has shown that kemps ridleys forage off the upper texas and louisiana coasts and migrate all along the texas coast
8197555 the commission and the people of texas should be very proud that the kemps ridley sea turtle population is showing encouraging increases after years of grim statistics about their decline

8197567 ons zorgteam heeft naar deze aanvraag gekeken en uiteindelijk gezegd wij willen het proberen maar realiseer je wel dat wij als school onze beperkingen kennen we zijn een groeiende school we hebben veel jonge leerkrachten kortom we zijn geen gespecialiseerde school daarom zijn de ouders op zoek gegaan naar een andere school temeer omdat kort daarop hun kind een zogeheten cluster 4 indicatie wat duidt op psychiatrische of gedragsproblemen heeft ontvangen daar hebben wij sowieso geen capaciteiten voor
8197568 er zijn wel mogelijkheden bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van ambulante begeleiding van externen de ondersteuning blijft dan echter toch heel beperkt cluster 4 leerlingen zijn erg gevoelig voor prikkels en daarom zitten ze bijvoorbeeld in kleine klassen daar zijn echter speciale voorzieningen voor nodig waar wij niet in kunnen voorzien

8197591 over de kwaliteit van het onderwijs is veel te doen tal van rapporten zijn geschreven het is terecht een belangrijk thema je wilt immers het beste voor je kinderen maar wat is kwaliteit eigenlijk
8197592 een goede kwalificatie geeft aan dat je school te vertrouwen is daar kun je je kinderen met een gerust hart naartoe sturen
8197593 meetbaarheid van kwaliteit maar ook van prestaties zijn belangrijk in onze kennismaatschappij voldoet de school aan de norm presteert een kind wel goed de ratio is daarbij de ultieme norm mensen worden vooral economisch gewaardeerd met cijfers denken we de werkelijkheid onder controle te kunnen brengen
8197594 dan doen we tekort aan het eigene van de mens immers hoe goed ken je een school of een leerling als je alleen naar de cijfers kijkt
8197595 dat is niet meetbaar maar wel merkbaar identiteit moet worden geleefd het besef dat onze kwaliteiten niet aan gods norm voldoen moet ons daarbij bescheiden maken alleen door jezus genade kan ons werk vrucht dragen

8197617 we demand immediate lifting of curfew the situation of the peaceful expression of peoples demands be utilized to initiate a political dialogue the political establishment is duty bound to do so when people in such large numbers are voicing these demands
8197618 there is no sign of violence subsiding in kandhmal even though three days have passed since the killing of swami laxmananda saraswati
8197619 i have handed over a letter withdrawing my support to the government to the speaker kishore mohanty
8197620 we have sought the central leaderships permission to withdraw support the government has admitted its failure to provide security to the vhp leader saraswati
8197621 yes the bjp mlas met me last evening the party is aware of the sentiments of the members after the gruesome killing of saraswati
8197622 who has actually done it killing of vhp leader laxmanananda saraswati or indulging in violence that followed we have to find out some people say this party or this section of society having this kind of ideology has done it let it be decided
8197623 i have been in contact with the chief minister of orissa and i have told him that the incident in which the swami was killed has to be condemned but it should not cause damage to others and it is the responsibility of the state government and all of us that different sections of society should not be attacked
8197624 unless and until it is proved who has done it acting against some section of society is wrong
8197625 we have issued shoot at sight order following large scale violence and rioting in some curfew bound areas of kandhamal district
8197626 in four month old babies we demonstrate very early specialisation and indeed an adult like pattern of activation of the brain regions that process face to face social interaction
8197627 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8197628 iphone did not support flash or java both integral to many web pages
8197629 benefit of the iphone in being able to offer availability to all internet websites in contrast to other handsets which offered access to wap versions or sites selected by service providers
8197630 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8197631 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8197632 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8197633 it is the responsibility of the policyholder not the insurer to ensure that their sums insured adequately represent the cost of replacing items
8197634 while private equity wasnt immune to the turbulence in the financial markets in the first quarter of 2008 swings in private equity valuations are tempered by the focus on long term management of underlying investments instead of reaction to quarterly earnings announcements
8197635 if recent history is any indication funds launched in turbulent times can obtain pricing advantages to generate significant long term returns
8197636 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8197637 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame

8197645 hola mi nombre es maria victoria y soy de cordoba argetina la verdad
8197646 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
8197647 this long term orientation will keep us from selling in panic in a market downturn
8197648 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8197649 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves
8197650 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses we have to take away the excuses
8197651 vilifying the extremely fat doesnt make people change their behaviour
8197652 lots of warm words but with very little policy substance
8197653 this is a very hard decision for me to make
8197654 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex
8197655 i feel that i could possible play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100
8197656 there are not enough words to express my gratitude to the club but i would like to specially thank peter moores mark robinson chris adams all my team mates all the fans and everyone who is part of this magnificent family for all the opportunities and memories that they have provided me with
8197657 if i have hurt anyone in my time i never meant it and would like to apologise as there is no shame in apologising to my family
8197658 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8197659 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county

8197666 thirty six hours is too long and if were going to have an air detection system like this we need to reduce the time
8197667 if we are going to spend money to try to detect these poisons we need to do it in a way that saves people and not just spends money
8197668 it was never intended to be that real time is there one spore of some little agent thats floating in the air oops we need to get everyone away from there
8197669 its really just to provide us with lead time that might be beneficial in preventing illness
8197670 if these new generations of systems are better and quicker and cheaper than they may make a better program for us
8197671 this one has been pretty expensive but i think it may lead to some things that may work and are much more cost affective
8197672 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8197673 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8197674 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20 degrees and it rains rains rains
8197675 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8197676 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8197677 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8197678 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8197679 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8197680 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8197681 it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to
8197682 we can easily produce 3 500mw of electricity from the coal to be extracted from the phulbari mine

8197686 we dont want it to be zimbabwe versus britain its zimbabwe versus the world
8197687 founded the study of eugenics and the theory of anticyclones
8197688 is to make the encouragement of chinese settlements of africa a part of our national policy in the belief that the chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior negro race i should expect that the african seaboard now sparsely occupied by lazy palavering savages might in a few years be tenanted by industrious order loving chinese living either as a semi detached dependency of china or else in perfect freedom under their own law
8197689 how china is taking over africa and why we in the west should be very worried
8197690 we dont want it to be zimbabwe versus britain its zimbabwe versus the world
8197691 the loss of life in such blighted places as sudans darfur province and somalia is still many times higher than in zimbabwe
8197692 investors should appreciate the fact that paragon benefits from non recourse financing arrangements with its bond investors while it has full recourse to guarantees provided by its customers the buy to let landlords

8197694 although no company can be immune from the economic pressures facing europe our portfolio is in good shape and we continue to believe that this is a good time to invest with company valuations and debt multiples back to more sensible levels realisations however will be harder to achieve
8197695 the value of candovers portfolio has been largely maintained despite the continued economic uncertainty the recent investments in technogym and expro international show that candover is very much open for business despite the credit crisis
8197696 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8197697 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck

8197699 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8197700 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8197701 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better

8197703 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
8197704 for me it was the key moment of the race
8197705 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error
8197706 but first of all i cannot understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race they have all the information that is needed to make a judgment during the grand prix
8197707 elfsborg were beaten 2 0 the other night but that result doesnt matter and our result against sligo rovers doesnt matter either
8197708 they are a very good side and just watching them in the first half against us their movement was fantastic
8197709 thursday will be a massive night at richmond park but by no means do i think well be favourites
8197710 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8197711 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus

8197715 ramadan is the month of self restraint it is a time when we renew our total surrender and commitment to allahs command and to bring the message of peace and sobriety to all mankind we are calling for halt of military offensives from both sides
8197716 the milf should inform the military that their milf soldiers will lay down their firearms to undergo fasting
8197717 when one is fasting he must refrain from uttering false statements avoid loud voice which will disturb others and if any one fights you tell him that you are fasting instead of fighting back
8197718 we just follow orders so far there is none we will base our movements on orders
8197719 the reports of the candidates showed they all complied with the law
8197720 the parliament speaker has said anwar will be sworn in as an mp on thursday
8197721 we will all be there to welcome anwar as the leader of the opposition and the parliament will be very different with his voice
8197722 it is a real morale boost for the pakatan rakyat in parliament
8197723 the prime thing is to get back in contact with those mps that have given their word that they would support pakatan when i return to parliament
8197724 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
8197725 yvonne was asked to give a presentation at a corporate
8197726 they called it a home run at first so i didnt think they were going to change it but hey if those are the rules those are the rules you play by
8197727 from my seat i thought it wasnt at first but after i went out and argued with him and talked with him a little while he said he definitely saw it but i definitely think we still need replay
8197728 hes beaten me so many times i felt good against him all night
8197729 even if youre having an off year youre going to sprinkle a few in here and there we got one so at least we get off the schneid for a season
8197730 its going to take a lot more time to get in and out
8197731 im a hurling person but its great to see the footballers there
8197732 we brought the three of them in last year for the intermediate hurlers and i wanted them for the seniors this year and i thought id get them in
8197733 but there was a conflict between hurling and football with obyrne and walsh cup pre season games and the problem arises when you have fellas wanted by both panels its impossible now to manage a lad at both levels but id love to have brian red barry lyng and rory stafford
8197734 cork would have fellas like that too good dual players and its no coincidence the counties going for three in a row kerry and kilkenny are one code counties
8197735 there is a strong probability that the affair will sort itself out before the end of the week
8197736 as far as worthington goes doug will be suited up and ready to go
8197737 exactly when hell get his car keys back be sent into the game i dont know that answer at this moment but it wont be at the beginning
8197738 it is resolved from an institutional standpoint hes got some other things to take care of but i think were in good shape
8197739 boom herron had a 100 percent time to carry it in a scrimmage where brandon was out mo wells was nicked a little
8197740 i think boom has demonstrated that hes ready to go and i know what doc tressel his brother dick running backs coach hopes is that all of those guys are ready to roll
8197741 nice girl but about as sharp as a sack of wet mice
8197742 it has nothing to do with her or her performance or her listenership or her sponsorship
8197743 it was slicing the talk pie pretty thin and we just found that quite honestly it was like trying to push a boulder uphill
8197744 of a certain mind set who are hungry to hear their own voice coming back at them on the radio
8197745 lewis lernt dazu er wird mental st rker und wei wie er den wm kampf zu f hren hat
8197746 klar ich m chte immer gewinnen aber ich habe gelernt dass es manchmal von vorteil ist so viele punkte wie m glich mitzunehmen und an einem anderen tag zu k mpfen
8197747 mein ziel ist die weltmeisterschaft die gewinnt man aber nicht wenn man in der mauer landet weil man ein beroptimistisches berholman ver probiert hat
8197748 wir haben meine f hrung in der wm ausgebaut obwohl wir zwei punkte auf felipe verloren haben ich bin mental stark genug um damit klar zu kommen und ich bin auch entspannter ich konzentriere mich auf das gro e ziel
8197749 this is a very hard decision for me to make
8197750 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex
8197751 i feel that i could possible play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100
8197752 there are not enough words to express my gratitude to the club but i would like to specially thank peter moores mark robinson chris adams all my team mates all the fans and everyone who is part of this magnificent family for all the opportunities and memories that they have provided me with
8197753 if i have hurt anyone in my time i never meant it and would like to apologise as there is no shame in apologising to my family
8197754 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8197755 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county
8197756 he feels good about being able to rehab and come along so were giving him a little bit more time to get ready if we didnt think he could play this season then he wouldnt be on pup
8197757 all right then why am i so sore the next day
8197758 no one wants to look at the so called little games but were not taking anybody for granted especially after last years season where upsets were pretty much the theme
8197759 you cant really prepare for something like that it can happen
8197760 when ohio state gets talked about on espn they mention youngstown state is their opener i heard running back beanie wells the other day say they were focused on youngstown state
8197761 the thing that weve talked a lot about with our guys is managing those expectations
8197762 the only way you can manage expectations is be focused on whats going on this moment
8197763 its one of those situations where if theyre going to review the play then well probably only show it once
8197764 i have always appreciated the fact that i got to follow jim tressel
8197765 not that i have to follow him but i get to follow him
8197766 most of the fans are kind of unhappy they havent gone to the playoffs but one time
8197767 but what jons doing is quite a bit more difficult than when tressel was here
8197768 we havent had some of the success tressels teams had but i think in fairness times have changed
8197769 thats not an excuse but its a very different thing than it was in the past
8197770 my inner peace comes from knowing were doing things the right way
8197771 were treating people right were working hard every minute of every day and doing the best we can somebody else will decide whether thats good enough
8197772 the best way to show that is through revenue and attendance figures
8197773 and our revenue has been up virtually every year and attendance has remained in the top 10 in the country so we havent seen a great drop off
8197774 i hope taht those people who posts too much gift would lessen their gifts by giving 1 gift at a person then done since if you really sincere in this new rule taht mod ice implemented
8197775 il faut red finir les parit s relancer les investissements au moyen de pr ts l chelle
8197776 this easy to follow course has brought us in step with the holy spirit bringing life and revelation from the word of god and deep personal inner peace

8197783 i have to answer questions about it all the time but i dont look too much into my record or era
8197784 i want to put up as many zeros as i can get as deep into the game as i can and give my team a chance to win its really that simple
8197785 even when we were making our trades there was a lot of work going on behind the scenes
8197786 thats the thing about baseball the last place you see all the work being done is on the field
8197787 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8197788 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8197789 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8197790 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8197791 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8197792 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8197793 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8197794 the computer models are all over the place right now
8197795 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8197796 thirty per cent of female online daters have sex on the first date
8197797 even way before we meet we already feel a bond and a connection so i think why not go for it when we eventually do
8197798 and if theres no connection when we meet at least i dont have to eat alone
8197799 although ill be damned if i know how else to meet a nice girl all my girl friends are taken and my male friends are all married or seem doomed to a life of celibacy
8197800 while i do get looks from men none of them approach me or my friends
8197801 were not looking desperate either were just catching up and we do make eye contact with some guys but they dont come up to us when we do come up to them they just seem so uninterested
8197802 i was 17 we met in a chat room and i didnt really know that he was for real my instinct was working alright i suppose we had only talked for a couple of hours and it was new years eve and i didnt really want to go to the usual parties so he asked me to come up and meet him in sydney instead we kissed under the bridge fireworks stayed together all the next day usual soppy stuff weve been together since
8197803 i dont think anyone falls in love online i think the conversation should be the hook not the sinker if you think you are in love with an online persona the risk of them fooling you is much higher
8197804 now i want to see how we recover from the hard work every game has its difficulties and the game against numancia will have its own too
8197805 we have to learn from these defeats because now the league is beginning and we wantt o make a good start
8197806 we have carried out a pre season campaign that was designed to prepare us for the season but also to ensure that we qualified for the champions league 2 he continued
8197807 wij hebben ons altijd gematigd opgesteld vanwege de situatie bij ceres
8197808 ze zeggen dat er een recessie aankomt en daardoor geen ruimte te hebben voor looneisen
8197809 bij ect in rotterdam is de afgelopen twee jaar vier procent betaald plus bedragen ineens
8197810 de salari ring bij ceres is veel te rigide wij moeten voor alle kunstjes gelijk betaald worden
8197811 maar gisteren barstte de bom toen ceres niet wilde ingaan op onze eisen de maat is vol
8197812 daar moeten we het bedrijf dan eerst netjes van op de hoogte stellen
8197813 im very very disappointed for the players because they put in an absolutely huge effort out there what a comeback it was from them and thats the spirit we want
8197814 we are 3 2 up and the referee gave a penalty against us when it hit dean shiels in his ribs he has a red mark on his side ive watched it on video many times and its never a penalty it does not hit his arm and they score
8197815 for their fourth goal i felt it was an assault on chris hogg a clear foul to us paartalu never looks at the ball he looks at hogg and hogg looks at the ball
8197816 their physios came on but hogg went off and their player did not we are a man short as a result

8197941 those who murdered this champion of iraqs reconstruction must be seen for what they are criminals working against the interests of the people of iraq
8197942 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men

8197953 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8197954 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8197955 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8197956 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8197957 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8197958 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8197959 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years
8197960 ik was verbijsterd toen ik het weer in de winkel zag liggen

8197965 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8197966 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8197967 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8198038 chicas y maletas me parece muy buen t tulo para una comedia de mujeres abandonadas
8198039 pina el personaje que interpreta pen lope no se parece a carmen maura es m s un cruce entre la mar a barranco de mujeres y la audrey hepburn de sabrina se trata de una adaptaci n muy libre de mujeres y s repito el gazpacho pero lo resuelvo de otra manera
8198040 hay un director y una actriz una actriz que por fin cumple su sue o pero que le llega en un momento en el que los problemas que atraviesa le crean enormes dificultades para actuar y para ser graciosa est delgada demacrada pero tiene que ser chispeante el reto para ella es terrible en el peor momento posible tiene que resultar una gran actriz c mica
8198041 yo necesitaba una comedia ligera y divertida para ponerla al servicio del drama y pens que lo m s c modo era utilizar una de mis pel culas y hacer una versi n libre
8198042 en los ltimos a os mi cine ha girado en torno al mundo de los sentimientos se ha ido oscureciendo y por eso pens en chicas y maletas como en un regalo un capricho una posibilidad de volver atr s y como no creo que vuelva a hacer una pel cula pop entera echar una cana al aire
8198043 la mitad del atrezzo es m o yo quer a vivir en una casa discreta pero est claro que no puede ser
8198044 el director de chicas y maletas quiere hacer una comedia muy estilizada un pop mondrianesco destilado desde la mirada de los a os noventa
8198045 es curioso no s lo hemos rodado en el mismo estudio en el que rodamos mujeres sino tambi n en el mismo decorado de entonces ocupamos el mismo espacio el rodaje de mujeres fue dif cil y ste tampoco ha sido f cil todo es un poco de locos convertir la comedia en drama conseguir una interpretaci n que resulte pat tica en escenas propias de un vodevil hacer una pel cula en la que parece que nada funciona hacerlo mal a prop sito pero sin caer en la parodia pen lope y carmen machi pina y chon han superado el reto y al final todos nos re mos mucho ha sido una experiencia muy interesante para ellas y para m mismo y la verdad es que pese a todo nos hemos divertido tanto que hay m s chicas y maletas de lo previsto y hasta creo que har algunas modificaciones en el gui n para incluir alguna secuencia m s
8198046 es todo un g nero sin olvidar ese subg nero que yo adoro el de las pel culas que hablan de actrices me gusta mucho cautivos del mal porque habla de un mundo que no es o o con unos personajes feroces que tienen ese cinismo enorme que a veces se necesita para poder seguir adelante o el crep sculo de los dioses otra de mis grandes favoritas el cine me fascina como elemento dram tico y tambi n como mundo profesional para situar a mis personajes pienso en arrebato de zulueta que cuenta tan bien esa parte vampirizadora del cine ese mundo del que tanto nos quejamos pero del que somos totales adictos el cine forma parte de mi experiencia de toda mi experiencia y por eso se habla mucho de pel culas en mis pel culas mis personajes igual que se puede hablar de comida novios o la madre naturaleza se comunican a trav s de referencias a otras pel culas no pretenden ser homenajes ni tributos sino parte activa del gui n
8198047 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8198048 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8198049 there is no blockade any ship can get in american and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes and what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8198050 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and stability in the caucasus
8198051 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming
8198052 russias actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation in direct violation of international law
8198053 the russian federation is seeking to validate the use of violence direct military aggression and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state
8198054 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8198055 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state
8198056 absolutely inevitable short of losing our dignity as a nation
8198057 the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8198058 because its so hard to answer i have many interests and i like keeping busy and working on several projects at the same time right now im developing an arts centre i dont see myself as a person who just does one thing i understand that sometimes that might sound a bit unprofessional but i disagree
8198059 it is a bunch of things i like to create to do something new something that does not have a predictable outcome i love art and this project excites me and it has an incredible potential to be immensely challenging and satisfying of course everyone wants to make a difference and help people or provide things they would be happy to see
8198060 i have had an interest in art since childhood i loved to draw as a child and still do though
8198061 i wont pretend to be the biggest connoisseur of the contemporary artists of today
8198062 sometimes you see photographers in places you would not expect but overall it is pretty calm
8198063 when youre 10 you dont realise its difficult its an adventure when youre in a situation that is foreign to you you just have to pull yourself together and adapt
8198064 you dont buy that kind of thing unless you really want to show off what a big collector you are
8198065 i have never been a collector i have a few pieces that i got for my birthdays or that i bought for myself i acquire things that speak to me and put them on my wall when i see things i like i just know
8198066 the first priority is not when will there be a first women president of russia but when the president will be someone not chosen by the oligarchs and the vlast the powers that be
8198067 i definitely feel russian i feel russian but at the same time when im in the states i feel at home too i dont know if this is a patriotic gesture or just a lucky coincidence
8198068 i just saw the building and thought what a great place nothing ever turns out the way you plan it or imagine it
8198069 people will come and see the space because of abramovichs name he buys significant art works giving a sense of assurance to those who are not yet sure whether its worth collecting contemporary art and garage has an opportunity to become moscows tate modern it will be for tourists art professionals and just for ordinary people who want to know more about the taste of the wealthiest man in russia
8198070 dashas reputation is controversial people who know her adore her those who were accidentally not invited to the garage private opening already started hating her
8198071 they are afraid of it the level of appreciation is just not there and the government does not support contemporary art
8198072 dasha is very intelligent and she educates herself very quickly about everything to do with the art world i think she will be able to bring this to a new audience here its certainly one of the most original spaces in moscow
8198073 it will be very upsetting and distasteful if its all just a game lets all go and live in london lets all collect art now to develop this kind of project you need a big plan and i hope they have one if theyre just playing at contemporary art the sooner its over the better but if this is their lifes work then it merits respect if its serious then its worthy to develop something like this in moscow requires a lot of energy and huge material investment because russian art deserves this kind of legacy
8198074 dashas reputation in the art world is not yet well established
8198075 as people tend to think she is like a moth that flies to the light to strengthen the russian side of her character she would need to make more friends in moscow just to become native which is quite realistic given her russian childhood people talk of her as an exotic fruit from overseas

8198139 this is the first time that the vcsel has been tested in an application and we have shown its suitability for gas sensing
8198140 the vcsel was manufactured by vertilas and the technical university of munich here at siemens we are working on a co sensor prototype while vertilas plans to commercialize the 2 3 micron vcsel
8198141 a v shaped quantum well design was employed with 1 nm of pure inas in the centre of the quantum well
8198142 otherwise the device is a typical buried tunnel junction inp vcsel
8198143 the laser wavelength is modulated sinusoidally at frequencies in the khz range
8198144 an absorption line converts the wavelength modulation to an amplitude modulation which is recorded by the photodetector a narrowband detection is possible which allows for very selective and sensitive detection of the absorption signal with a good noise suppression the method is also insensitive to unwanted light such as sunlight on the photodetector a lock in amplifier was used to perform standard second harmonic detection
8198145 we did a wavelength scan of 3 7 nm corresponding to a temperature variation of 15 c to 37 c
8198146 this was not the whole tuning range at least 6nm is likely

8198203 the government could get to the position of saying that looking at the overall economic development position of the country and the picture on energy use high speed rail is a sensible thing to do
8198204 if growth continues at its current rate then it could well be that we reach growth forecasts for 20 years time in 10 instead in which case all the capacity improvements planned in the rail white paper are exposed a lot sooner than expected
8198205 there is very little evidence that high speed rail links help regional performance
8198206 there is an argument for spending a lot more money on the existing low speed railway service there are not enough people making long journeys for high speed rail to make sense

8198446 we wanted to monitor the deterioration of the scrolls and realized we needed to take precise photographs to watch the process thats when we decided to do a comprehensive set of photos both in color and infrared to monitor selectively what is happening we realized then that we could make the entire set of pictures available online to everyone meaning that anyone will be able to see the scrolls in the kind of detail that no one has until now
8198447 every undergraduate will be able to have a detailed look at them from numerous angles
8198448 for example even though the two copies of isaiah discovered in qumran cave 1 near the dead sea in 1947 were a thousand years earlier than the oldest dated manuscript previously known ad 980 they proved to be word for word identical with our standard hebrew bible in more than 95 percent of the text the 5 percent of variation consisted chiefly of obvious slips of the pen and and variations in spelling they do not affect the meaning of revelation in the slightest

8198456 if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a small chance of survival there may even be a worse case you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory because it is better to perish than to live as slaves

8198472 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8198473 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8198474 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8198475 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8198476 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8198477 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8198478 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8198479 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8198488 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8198489 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8198490 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8198491 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8198492 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8198493 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8198494 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8198495 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8198496 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8198497 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8198498 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8198499 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8198500 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8198501 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8198502 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8198503 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8198504 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8198508 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing
8198509 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand
8198510 for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do
8198511 tel aviv court yesterday has rejected taros contention that sun pharma should have conducted a special tender offer under israeli law
8198512 the court stated that the directors should have studied the agreements prior to their being signed and should have confirmed then that they were in the companys best interest
8198513 the court stated that the directors cannot claim now that they suddenly decided a special tender offer is necessary
8198514 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement

8198517 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8198518 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8198519 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8198520 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8198521 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8198522 now that britney has her bod back should we send her vt messages to get her to quit smoking
8198523 should homeland security include vt as part of their interagency communications package
8198524 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8198525 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8198526 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8198531 and third for all diabetes patients telehealth can serve as a long term reminder system for patients to monitor their blood sugar

8198551 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8198552 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8198553 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8198554 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8198555 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8198556 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8198557 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

8198563 in general important civilisations start with a rigid and superstitious system gradually relaxed and leading at a certain stage to a period of brilliant genius while the good of the old tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet developed but as the evil unfolds it leads to anarchy thence inevitably to a new tyranny producing a new synthesis secured by a new system of dogma the doctrine of liberalism is an attempt to escape from endless oscillation the essence of liberalism is an attempt to secure a social order not based on irrational dogma and insuring stability without involving more restraints than are necessary for the preservation of the community whether this attempt can succeed only the future can determine
8198564 today in capitalist and communist society many consider that the only knowledge worth having is that which will help them achieve some economic or bureaucratic goal which they happen to think important
8198565 a man should be aware of the minuteness of himself and his environment in relation to the world in time and space he should see his own age in relation to the past and the future he should be conscious of the vastness of geological epochs and astronomical abysses he should be aware of all this as a vast panorama which enlarges the mind that contemplates it

8198571 and throwing ourselves repeatedly into the tumult of the world with the intention of making our voices count only in this way do we really become human beings
8198572 we did a content analysis of the march 12th press release sent out by corrao and what we found were the names of 45 men and the name of one woman herself
8198573 this is a development slate more appropriate to syrian national television than to an american cable network owned by sumner redstones viacom
8198574 we dont know some studies have shown that when women reach positions of power they often pull up the ladder behind them
8198575 neverthless to have 45 men involved in developing your new comedy season and not a single woman should set off alarm bells to both corrao and ganeless and mtvs doug herzog that something is majorly wrong at their network
8198576 this years development slate features an incredibly diverse and versatile array of talent and concepts
8198577 our core viewers expect nothing short of the best comedy options and continue to connect with the brand weve built were confident that these ideas will resonate with them and will continue to grow the networks success into the coming year

8198583 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project

8198595 in hungary the results were better than normal and we were quite happy with the performance of the tyres but everyone was happy with the performance of the tyres on sunday because in hungary the grip was going up and sunday was okay for everybody
8198596 i think we need a test maybe this week in monza to really compare the tyres because in the race weekends the conditions change so much from friday to sunday you never know if it is worth what we do or not
8198597 its just putting them through a gentle duty cycle to make the tyre more resilient for the race

8198643 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8198644 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8198645 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8198646 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8198647 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8198648 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8198649 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8198650 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8198651 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8198652 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8198653 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8198654 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8198655 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8198656 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8198657 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8198658 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8198659 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8198660 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8198661 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8198662 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8198663 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8198664 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8198665 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8198666 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8198667 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8198668 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8198669 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8198670 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8198671 from the indications we are getting we are very confident of anwars lead
8198672 it is so bad that its very hard for us to determine accurate exit polls due to the large number of people filling the polling centres and the long jams outside
8198673 we dont know whether this is going to be a pattern as we have to continue to monitor the process until polling is closed
8198674 no untoward incidents so far and everything is under control
8198675 only ec secretary kamaruzaman mohd noor can give those details
8198676 but even if i lose its okay as our message has gone down to the voters they are aware of our message
8198677 we are entering parliament with a clear agenda and they bn should wake up with the stark realities of the day
8198678 its not anwar versus the other candidates its anwar versus the entire government machinery
8198679 as you can see the groundswell is great god willing im confident of winning
8198680 i voted at 8 08am as eight is a good number for me
8198681 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

8198793 it is time for state gas pricing laws to catch up to speed with the times
8198794 new jerseys current law is a holdover from a time when consumers had few options as to where they could buy gas and monopolistic companies could manipulate prices to run roughshod over the marketplace with the sheer number of choices available to motorists today consumers should be able to decide for themselves the acceptable price of a fill up
8198795 since gas is connected to everything if gas prices go down inflation will probably go down too
8198796 we are a gas and go just a gas and go competing with wawa who sells under cost and has stores inside
8198797 if they go below price then im done and theres nothing i can do about it
8198798 with prices as they are people are not looking for quality they are looking for cheap

8199067 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8199068 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8199069 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8199070 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas

8199072 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8199073 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8199074 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8199075 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8199076 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8199077 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8199078 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8199079 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8199080 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8199081 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8199082 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8199083 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8199084 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

8199090 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50 per cent
8199091 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8199092 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars

8199098 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8199102 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8199103 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8199104 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8199464 until you are in that position you dont know how youre going to react
8199465 it was almost like it had happened to someone else it was surreal
8199466 whilst incidents like these are extremely rare the public need to be mindful of the precautions they can take if they are selling any type of motor vehicle
8199467 they should always meet in a public place known to others in the company of other people they should also look at how they are travelling and who they are with anyone who turns up late at night with no means of available transport could be suspicious
8199468 there may be those who dont like the idea of offenders receiving help

8199562 by any construction and reasonable interpretation of the english language the nampa urban renewal agency is governed by the city
8199563 the question is should the city be allowed to borrow the money without a vote
8199564 one of the major tools in our toolkit is the ability to finance infrastructure
8199565 you have to have the ability to generate upfront cash that you pay back over time we dont have cash resources so we have to issue bonds
8199566 part of whats going in is money that would ordinarily go to the county
8199567 the legislature can pass a law establishing the mathematical pi as simply 3 but that doesnt change the underlying mathematical law any more than declaring urban renewal agencies to be a body politic independent of cities changes the constitution

8199573 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8199574 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8199575 but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa

8199582 the bbfc online is talking to apple about using its classification system but so far it has not signed up the online rating system however is not a legal requirement
8199583 the apple movie store is an aggregator site and these are a lot more complex to sort out classification for what apple seems to be doing is adding ratings to films that it knows the bbfc rating for and not the rest
8199584 apple uses its own rating system for all movies so if there are any missing they will be rated as soon as possible
8199585 the understanding is that the bbfc doesnt yet have all the studios on board and we only want to use one ratings system

8199649 fletch was outstanding in pre season and he has carried it on into the season
8199650 darren is a fantastic footballer you can tell by the interest in him from other teams there have been a number of clubs keen on him
8199651 he is a players player he has great capabilities in terms of when he is on the ball and his passing he makes the right runs and the right decisions on the ball his work rate is phenomenal
8199652 he does what the manager asks and that is why he is such a fantastic player to have in the squad he asks him to do different jobs and he just goes out and does them
8199653 he is someone the players appreciate more than maybe some other people do we are happy to have him in the squad
8199654 we had to keep that gap to a minimum it was imperative we won at portsmouth the manager said we had to win at all costs we did a professional job

8199671 apart from the goal we conceded that was just what we wanted im really happy with that performance
8199672 im delighted we got the crowd that we did it was double what we got at this stage last season the type of football were playing is encouraging people to come
8199673 to see some of our new players get off the mark with goals is pleasing especially for marvin emnes and didier digard
8199674 didier in particular made a big impact in the first half but there were loads of positives thats because as a group were working well
8199675 were getting performances because the organisation is good and that allows people to express themselves on the pitch
8199676 we made a lot of changes from saturday but if i had to field that side in the premier league you wouldnt lose much sleep that shows the strength in depth
8199677 the level of the forum will be quite high this year the president of the world petroleum council the biggest organization of petroleum experts worldwide

8199687 its been shown time and time again that there is no correlation between years of experience and skill in programming after about six to twelve months working in any particular technology stack you either get it or you dont no matter how many years of experience another programmer has under their belt theres about even odds that they have no idea what theyre doing
8199688 specialists often have difficulties working with others either they lack the humility to recognize that other people have something of value to offer or they are so narrowly focused that they may not realize that their work may cause someone else to do significant rework later on
8199689 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8199690 this is a consequence of the governments obsession with policing on the cheap as well as their staggering complacency towards the extension of surveillance
8199691 community safety accreditation schemes enable chief constables to designate limited powers to employees of organisations who contribute towards community safety
8199692 csas supports neighbourhood policing by building links improving communications and helping in the delivery of effective policing to neighbourhoods accredited persons have a key role to play in the delivery of neighbourhood policing and are an important part of the extended police family
8199693 they are an extra pair of eyes and ears and if tasked properly they will get results because unlike police officers who can get diverted they are usually on the street for seven hours engaging with the community
8199694 its pretty well documented how i feel about him and how the team feels about him and how important he is to the team and to this offense
8199695 were certainly hoping for good news jeffs one of the old school players hes one of the tough guys on this team and in this league
8199696 i came here and told you a couple of years ago were putting dallas clark on ir injured reserve and he ended up being probably the most valuable player in the 2006 playoff run
8199697 i think were still at that point where jeff has some options we dont really know how bad it is
8199698 were going to look at it and it will probably be through this weekend until it gets sorted out
8199699 but it could be the type of thing where he could be back next week or it could be something major if he needs surgery
8199700 i never really like talking too much about the injury because then if you come back and play they say man how tough is he
8199701 and then if you dont play well they say well theres the reason
8199702 he congratulated me and told me how happy he was for me

8199704 you are tasked with protecting mining facilities from ravenous space bugs using some truly fearsome weaponry and youll need as much strategy as firepower as you fend off wave after wave
8199705 each level in savage moon is set on an imoon or a living asteroid and it is up to you to keep the mining facilities safe
8199706 to defend the mines you start off with machine gun towers and can expand your arsenal to include wide range of weaponry and heavy artillery this is where your strategising skills come into play its up to you when to upgrade add new towers or save your money and your strategies will make the difference between escaping unscathed and watching the mines go up in flames

8199759 this latest research confirms we have a serious problem of self harm in the uk particularly among women
8199760 although we have made excellent progress in improving support services we still have a long way to go
8199761 conferences such as this provide an opportunity to share our understanding of suicidal behaviour and to develop better care
8199762 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8199763 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8199764 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect
8199765 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense

8199773 west ham united have absolutely no intention to sell craig bellamy he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
8199774 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
8199775 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to the first team squad if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look to offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
8199776 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables
8199777 i have a body mass index of 28 which means im classified as slightly overweight i make no secret about the fact that i could be fitter but following fitness training with mens health last year i use a running machine and my children wear me out playing football
8199778 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight
8199779 richard brings 24 years as a professional theatre practitioner to the lyric theatre

8199782 the incident has claimed the lives of hundreds of fish mostly stone loach but also roach and pike
8199783 we are anxious to find out the cause of the pollution but our officers are also engaged in an operation to pump oxygen into the canal to protect stock
8199784 the agency would urge anyone who knows anything about this to help our investigation identify those responsible
8199785 the squad includes many players who have won u16 and u18 inter provincial titles but this tournament will be very different we are going as a provincial team to play against the english scottish and welsh international squads
8199786 we just want to raise awareness we havent got any ulterior motive our only motive is to stop kids dying
8199787 we all live in different parts of the country and kids are dying in all of those areas not just in london
8199788 every single community around the country is having the same problems with knife crime
8199789 the fact is that to do anything in the world worth doing we must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger but jump in and scramble through as well as we can

8199801 were raising our game this year and beyond thanks to welcome increased investment we aim to provide the best total arts experience in ireland
8199802 when you read through the programme ask yourself where else you might find such an incredible array of local national and international talent edinburgh maybe but where else this festival is an annual arts and entertainment olympics there is so much to enjoy and i would urge audiences to try on something new for size alongside the household names
8199803 it would be great to see as many people as possible cheering us along
8199804 when the idea of the convoy to commemorate the life of colin was born we never imagined 1300 subarus would be taking part
8199805 we have subarus joining us from all over europe from poland and the ukraine to france and spain while some fans are flying in especially from australia and argentina to be part of this memorable occasion
8199806 colin was a huge favourite in ireland and we have a large number coming over to join the convoy from lanark
8199807 i havent had two minutes to sit down it has been a bit overwhelming to be honest
8199808 there can be hardly anyone under 50 who can remember success here
8199809 we dont do anything in this town now but shop mansfield used to be known for its textile mills stocking factories and the brewery there used to be a pit in every village nearly all that is gone even the stags mansfield town football club have been relegated out of the football league after 77 years this has given everyone in the town a lift
8199810 she has done the town proud and it will encourage young people to get involved it is good to hear something nice being said about mansfield you should see this place on a friday or saturday night
8199811 it has definitely made us more confident and i hope it will encourage the sport we all feel inspired
8199812 not a lot of the boys were very interested but i think they are starting to take notice of it and they are getting behind sam hynd in the paralympics he is from mansfield as well
8199813 i meet other players who played under him and we have all got our own stories he was certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of a doubt i just feel very lucky to have had that opportunity he was a genius and he has still left his mark on the football club
8199814 he would probably have thought i would be the last person to become a manager because my own off the field life wasnt exactly perfect we were there a few weeks ago for a pre season friendly and you still feel he is around the building
8199815 cloughie and alex ferguson keanes manager at manchester united whom he joined from forest in 1993 were very hard with me but generally they were fair with me as well and thats what i try to do with my own players i had one or two incidents with him and i look back now to when he sent me back from jersey for a drinking incident and he was spot on he was just being fair with me i was no angel
8199816 i made that mistake last year at luton and i have not forgotten that that is very much in my mind set they were two big cup games that i havent forgotten about
8199817 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8199818 the names that other teams are signing do not impress me
8199819 we were not good on saturday and we lost the game it is as simple as that
8199820 you cannot want the supporters not to take it to heart because we do we are all very disappointed with our performance we completely understand the critics because we were not good but we promise we will come back and play well tomorrow
8199821 we did not play well as a team everybody knows that and william is no more guilty than anybody else
8199822 it would be unfair to single anybody out we lost as a team and we want to respond as a team
8199823 we live in a world now where you have to accept the critics but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well on saturday but we know as well we have the quality to respond
8199824 we have to respect twente and come into the game with a desire to win
8199825 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8199826 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8199827 this tour has shown all people in tv at least i hope it has that this is what is lacking nowadays
8199828 you should be able to make a joke about anybody without them taking offence thats whats wrong with comedy now it has gone too politically correct
8199829 but now you can eff and blind all you want
8199830 everything starts at the beginning it is like a circle it all comes back again eventually someone comes along and they find these things in the archive and they say this is all right this
8199831 i have done more television in the past 12 months than when i was the bbcs brightest discovery
8199832 i have done so much television it is not true i dont think any of us has ever not been in work but there is that peculiar belief that if you are not on television you must be starving
8199833 i suspect that todays breaking news that there are more people over the age of 80 than we have children hasnt filtered through to television executives who have come from media studies rather than actually doing something when i say this people say he wants his show back on but i dont because it was damn hard work
8199834 people ask me why im not on telly any more i tell them i cant do magic while im cooking or painting a house
8199835 if they are not patriotic why the hell have we got the olympics
8199836 if i dont do a joke about an indian a black fellow or a chinaman it is racist to leave them out
8199837 we are the last of the line of the vaudeville performers
8199838 there has been no variety on television for the past 10 years it has just been reality what is sad is that people have never seen a juggler or a balancing act they have never heard the street comic they might have heard the university comic but not the comic who learnt his act on the street comedy became the new rocknroll and kids decided they didnt want to laugh at what their mums and dads were laughing at
8199839 audiences have got easier than they were in the seventies or eighties there was so much competition then but everyone has not got the same taste and people have the right to like what they like
8199840 when the public dont want you the worst thing you can do is hang on it is important to get out gracefully
8199841 it is very rare for anyone to get to win a gold medal for their country athletes do it but singers dont often so it is a great honour to be doing this best of british
8199842 we have known everyone from the beginning we all came up the same way
8199843 we are working all year round but when people find out i am with brotherhood of man they say whatever happened to them
8199844 everybody ends up in our dressing room after the show it is like the green room we have so much fun
8199845 if someone had said to us when we wrote save your kisses for me that people would still be singing it in 32 years time i would have been very happy with that fans bring their kids along and i can remember when they were 10 years old with their mums and dads it is a bit frightening
8199846 mr krankie your little boys willy has fallen off and i think hes going through the menopause

8199867 since jasons had the injury every week that hes played hes either hurt it or dislocated it and thats not going to change
8199868 if he plays on the weekend i reckon you can guarantee it will get dislocated again
8199869 it could happen with jason just putting his hand up in the air
8199870 it can happen anywhere it could happen running out the race lets hope not but it could happen
8199871 its more about the capacity for jason to one get the shoulder back in which we think we can and two his capacity to perform with it
8199872 he showed you against sydney when he kicked five goals that hes clearly capable of doing that
8199873 its hard to comprehend sometimes what it would be like going into a game believing or knowing that theres a real chance of you dislocating your shoulder especially when youre going for the ball each time
8199874 thats a really difficult thing for him to go through and it says something about his strength as an individual that hes been able to do it and still perform so well for us
8199875 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement

8199882 unlike john mccain for whom the internet is a mystery barack obama understands that rural communities cant be competitive until we have high speed internet access across the heartland
8199883 we delivered broadband to the most remote areas of our state because if you can send a job to bangalore india you sure as heck can send one to danville virginia and flint michigan and scranton pennsylvania and peoria illinois

8199910 we need u s taxpayers rebuilding america and putting people back to work
8199911 youd think that both parties would be scrambling to try to figure out how to move in a new direction but thats not what john mccain says
8199912 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it
8199913 she has always been looking out for working families all throughout kansas city
8199914 shes no longer the mayor but shell soon be the congresswoman from the 6th congressional district
8199915 we cannot compete on a global level if we dont educate our children
8199916 we need to enforce our labor laws that are on the books and get stronger labor laws
8199917 he said im not getting up to go over there and give a three sentence speech
8199918 the poverty rate going down does not mean poverty is going down
8199919 when you get two people who work it brings up your median income
8199920 while we are bringing in wealthy people we are also pushing out the middle class
8199921 when you look too micro youre not looking at the big picture
8199922 it means that its more visible who has and who doesnt
8199923 its kind of up close and personal with people who are on the other side of the tracks
8199924 our socioeconomic profile could more logically reflect trends in the caribbean and latin america
8199925 what clearly saved the day were the safety net programs
8199926 to put things in perspective that 45 million uninsured is more than the combined population of 24 states plus the district of columbia
8199927 with this percentage of winning it was not just the hispanic votes and that makes me proud
8199928 when i walked door to door i didnt just walk through specific neighborhoods
8199929 ive listened for the past two years to what people wanted i heard their complaints i heard their problems they felt they didnt get a response from county officials
8199930 im asking questions to try to get to the bottom of why congress and in turn the public was misled about the rate of improper payments by medicare
8199931 this is unconscionable and an affront to every american taxpayer who is footing the bill especially because we are not talking about millions of dollars
8199932 instead we are talking billions of dollars lost to fraud waste and or abuse in 2006
8199933 i highly urge that the appropriate hearings be held in order to determine the cause of this alleged misreporting
8199934 unfortunately its the taxpayer who ends up paying for all of this
8199935 it has been a continuing problem with medicare since its inception its always wasting money and no one is held to account for it
8199936 given its centrality to medicares financial oversight mission we are eager to adopt any meaningful changes to the program that will help enhance measurement efforts in particular and our overall program integrity efforts in general
8199937 oh dont say that weve got a little more work to do
8199938 ive heard that part of the reasons for the costs being so high is that our fda is understaffed to get new drugs on the market
8199939 do you have a plan to better staff the fda that they might be able to help lower the cost of prescription drugs
8199940 but we dont do that and the reason is because weve got special interests the drug company lobbyists that fought those provisions in the prescription drug bill that now is a part of medicare
8199941 and its an example of how weve got to fight against special interests in washington thats why i dont take back from you thats why i dont take money from lobbyists
8199942 as president i want to staff an fda with the best scientists the best experts and their goal is going to be how do you get safe drugs farther not how can they ensure the drug companies make a profit
8199943 when sen obama becomes president hell be the most powerful man in the free world
8199944 but hell be the second most powerful illinoisan in washington
8199945 hes going to need help but presidents always need help
8199946 with that sort of linkage with durbin and emanuel especially if rahm moves up in leadership then obama is going to have that momentum particularly if democrats make gains in congress
8199947 whats distinct is you have two friends in the leadership in both chambers
8199948 the best opportunity i will have to really make a significant difference in helping barack be successful
8199949 there are people at the table who will be as youre working through the presidents agenda very much his eyes and ears
8199950 it will be helpful in bridging the strategic gulf that sometimes separates each end of pennsylvania avenue
8199951 its mainly the coasts seeing a lot of insurance fraud and with the rising cost of health care thats inevitable
8199952 we want to make sure we have the exact right treatment plan attached to the right patient
8199953 we want to provide the best care possible to the patient
8199954 i had read this article about obama when he was running for the illinois senate i was impressed and i knew there was something special about him
8199955 i told my son back then that obama would be the first african american president
8199956 with marsha shearer you are talking about someone who has really supported obama in what is clearly an uphill battle where she lives
8199957 i havent felt so energized since 1968 presidential candidate eugene mccarthy trying to end the vietnam war
8199958 our politicians have made so many promises and not followed through
8199959 i want to tell obama that people want someone who can be accountable every year not every four years
8199960 i remember thinking i am going to go with the person who i think can really bring this country together
8199961 obama has an appeal that is based on smartness common sense and logic
8199962 if obama suddenly changed his affiliation but kept all his values and principles in response to the issues but called himself a republican then i would pull the republican lever
8199963 i became active in the 1960s during the vietnam era and was a huge supporter of eugene mccarthy
8199964 it was during that time that i learned the power of protest and that one person can really make a difference
8199965 i do think people are unhappy with county government and the commission but people like their commissioner
8199966 they do things like community outreach theyre involved and come campaign time they have a bank of goodwill
8199967 there are a lot of challenges but im very optimistic
8199968 i think hes in a very strong position the question is what is he going to do with it
8199969 right now i think hes going to try to push through the mega plan
8199970 every commissioner is going to be thinking about whos going to be the next mayor
8199971 no matter how much we talk about how dissatisfied we are people are reluctant to give change
8199972 i dont think were going to see innovative ideas to deal with our problems
8199973 these districts are very pleased with the commissioners even if they dont give the whole body straight as
8199974 why dont battered women leave the guys who are beating them up
8199975 you will see within the next four years major organized recalls of commissioners not one but in a bunch
8199976 governments must do more many governments in the region are engaged but the laws are not sufficient and the application of laws does not prevent trafficking
8199977 the report sounds an alarm we have a very long way to go to understand the problem we have an even further distance to go before we can deal with the problem
8199978 whats the worst possible thing that couldve happened to you in your life
8199979 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence in curfew bound areas of kandhamal
8199980 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market
8199981 its a planted story to try to ridicule mr zardari our party and the country
8199982 we hebben alles gedaan om tot een akkoord te komen maar dat is niet gelukt omdat er bij verschillende partners niet de wil was om tot een besluit te komen we moeten het dossier nu afronden voor de beleidsverklaring op 14 oktober er is een akkoord dat gerespecteerd moet worden en er zijn humanitaire noodgevallen
8199983 we zijn er niet ver van verwijderd het is een kwestie van goede wil
8199984 al die dossiers moeten deel uitmaken van een globaal akkoord dat we strenger zouden zijn staat in het regeerakkoord maar ik denk niet dat elke keer terugkomen op bijkomende voorwaarden de manier is om het klimaat te verbeteren
8199985 we beginnen er in dit land aan gewoon te raken te leven met het zwaard van damocles boven ons hoofd als we iedere keer afhankelijk zouden zijn van de beslissingen van de nv a en met gekruiste armen wachten zou dit dramatisch zijn voor het bestuur van het land
8199986 we have lodged a strong protest with our pakistan counterparts at the border outpost on the international border in the jammu frontier over pushing in of militants under the cover of cross border firing in kanachak area on tuesday
8199987 ongoing occasional skirmishes escalated south ossetia according to russian military some russian peacekeepers have been killed during this attack the following day russian forces attacked georgian units in south ossetia
8199988 in todays climate of globalization being serious about the business of business travel means an association with a worldwide name brand organization uniglobe travel offers a network of over 700 agencies in 38 countries around the world
8199989 we expect to benefit immediately from our association with uniglobe due to their global network
8199990 we look forward to not only offering our inbound program to other uniglobe agencies we also look forward to networking key accounts with other uniglobe agencies to grow our business
8199991 the exchange of local market intelligence and experiences is something that benefits everyone
8199992 itu tergantung pada kemana kredit diberikan dan bagaimana penyalurannya secara umum pertumbuhan ekonomi tetap cepat dan banyak kesempatan usaha untuk tumbuh
8199993 kita sudah mendapatkan komitmen pinjaman hingga rp2 triliun dari bank dana ini untuk melengkapi kas internal dan hasil ipo yang mencapai rp500 miliar
8199994 kita ekspansi di kalimantan dan sumatra nanti kita lihat lagi berapa luas lahan yang ada baru kita secara bertahap mencari pinjaman tambahan
8199995 wir brauchen beispielsweise die sicherheit dass eine neue regierung nicht ohne beschlossenen landeshaushalt dasteht
8199996 der aufschwung kann jederzeit durch eine falsche politik gef hrdet werden
8199997 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
